Following the suggestion in Stich (1983, pp. 237 ff.), we’ll call this cluster of claims *propositional modularity*.\n","\n","To illustrate the way in which folk psychology takes propositional attitudes to be *functionally discrete*, *causally active* states, let us sketch a more elaborate example.\n","\n","In common-sense psychology, behavior is often explained by appeal to certain of the agent’s beliefs and desires. Thus, to explain why Alice went to her office, we might note that she wanted to send some e-mail messages (and, of course, she believed she could do so from her office). However, in some cases an agent will have several sets of beliefs and desires each of which might lead to the same behavior. Thus we may suppose that Alice also wanted to talk to her research assistant, and that she believed he would be at the office. In such cases, common sense psychology assumes that Alice's going to her office might have been caused by either one of the belief/desire pairs, or by both, and that determining which of these options obtains is an empirical matter. So it is entirely possible that on this occasion Alice's desire to send some e-mail played no role in producing her behavior; it was the desire to talk with her research assistant that actually caused her to go to the office. However, had she not wanted to talk with her research assistant, she might have gone to the office anyhow, because the desire to sent some e-mail, which was causally inert in her actual decision making, might then have become actively involved. Note that in this case common sense psychology is prepared to recognize a pair of quite *distinct* *semantically characterized* states, one of which may be *causally active* while the other is not.\\\"\"\"\"\n","\n","text_conn_model = \"\"\"\\\"Connectionist models are large networks of simple parallel computing elements, each of which carries a numerical *activation value* which it computes from the values of neighboring elements in the network, using some simple numerical formula. The network elements, or *units*, influence each other’s values through connections that carry a numerical strength or *weight* ...\n","\n","In a typical ... model, input to the system is provided by imposing activation values on the *input units* of the network; these numerical values represent some encoding, or *representation*, of the input. The activation on the input units propagates along the connections until some set of activation values emerges on the *output units*; these activation values encode the output the system has computed from the input. In between the input and output units there may be other units, often called *hidden units*, that participate in representing neither the input nor the output.\n","\n","The computation performed by the network in transforming the input pattern of activity to the output pattern depends on the set of connection strengths; these weights are usually regarded as encoding the system's knowledge. In this sense, the connection strengths play the role of the program in a conventional computer. Much of the allure of the Connectionist approach is that many connectionist networks program themselves, that is, they have autonomous procedures for tuning their weights to eventually perform some specific computation. Such *learning procedures* often depend on training in which the network is presented with sample input/output pairs from the function it is supposed to compute. In learning networks with hidden units, the network itself ‘decides’ what computations the hidden units will perform; because these units represent neither inputs nor outputs, they are never ‘told’ what their values should be, even during training.\n","\n","In many connectionist models the hidden units and the output units are assigned a numerical ‘bias’ which is added into the calculation determining the unit’s activation level. The learning procedures for such networks typically set both the connection strengths and the biases. Thus in these networks the system’s knowledge is usually regarded as encoded in *both* the connection strengths and the biases.\\\"\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"h_hxx7-DQIWf"},"outputs":[],"source":["if False:\n","  completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n","      model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n","      seed=9,\n","      store=True,\n","      top_p = 0.01,\n","      messages=[\n","          {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Write a concise passage based on the given text, focusing on the concepts of *propositional modularity*, *functional discreteness*, *semantic interpretability*, and *causal role*.\"},\n","          {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": text_prop_modul}\n","      ],\n","  )\n","  prop_modul = \"\"\"\n","\n","  (\\*Information about propositional modularity, functional discreteness, semantic interpretability, and causal role: {} (Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, 1995))\n","\n","  \"\"\".format(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n","  print(prop_modul)\n","\n","prop_modul = \"\"\"\n","\n","(\\*Information about propositional modularity, functional discreteness, semantic interpretability, and causal role: Propositional modularity refers to the concept that propositional attitudes, such as beliefs and desires, are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, and play a causal role in behavior.

Sub-symbolic Definition of Cognitive Systems and Some Foundational Issues}\n","In order for the sub-conceptual level to be rightly viewed as a level for practicing cognitive science, it is necessary that the principles formulated at this level truly be principles of cognition. Since sub-symbolic principles are neither conceptual-level nor neural-level principles, it is not immediately apparent what kind of cognitive principles they might be. The structure of sub-symbolic models is that of a dynamical system; in what sense do these models embody principles of cognition rather than principles of physics?\n","\n","What distinguishes those dynamical systems that are cognitive from those that are not? At this point the types of dynamical systems being studied in Connectionist cognitive science lack anything that could justly be called an intentional psychology. In this section I wish to show that it is none the less possible to distinguish the sort of dynamical systems that have so far been the object of study in connectionist cognitive science from the dynamical systems that have traditionally been the subject matter of physics, and that the questions being studied are indeed questions of cognition.\\\\\n","A crucial property of cognitive systems broadly construed is that over a wide variety of environments they can maintain, at an adequately constant level, the degree to which a significant number of goal conditions are met. Here I intend the teleological, rather than the intentional, sense of 'goal'. A river, for example, is a complex dynamical system that responds sensitively to its environment - but about the only condition that it can satisfy over a large range of environments is going downhill. A cockroach manages, over an annoyingly extensive range of environments, to maintain its nutritive intake, its reproductive demands, its oxygen intake, even its probability of getting smashed, all within a relatively narrow band. The repertoire of conditions that people can keep satisfied, and the range of environments under which this relative constancy can be maintained, provides a measure worthy of the human cognitive capacity.\\\\\n","(19) Cognitive system: A necessary condition for a dynamical system to be cognitive is that, under a wide variety of environmental conditions, it maintains a large number of goal conditions. The greater the repertoire of goals and variety of tolerable environmental conditions, the greater the cognitive capacity of the system.\n","\n","The issue of complexity is crucial here. A river (or a thermostat) only fails to be a cognitive dynamical system because it cannot satisfy a large range of goals under a wide range of conditions.  Complexity is largely what distinguishes the dynamical systems studied in the sub-symbolic paradigm from those traditionally studied in physics. Connectionist dynamical systems have great complexity: the information content in their weights is very high. Studying the extent to which a connectionist dynamical system can achieve complex goals in complex environments requires grappling with complexity in dynamical systems in a way that is traditionally avoided in physics. In cognitive modeling, many of the basic questions concern the detailed dynamics of a distinct pattern of activation in a system with a particular initial state and a particular set of interaction strengths that are highly non-homogeneous. This is like asking a physicist: 'Suppose we have a gas with 10,000 particles with the following 10,000 different masses and the following 500,000 different forces between them. Suppose we start them at rest in the following 10,000 positions. What are the trajectories of the following 20 particles?' This is indeed a question about a dynamical system, and is, in a sense, a question of physics. It is this kind of question, however, that is avoided at all costs in physics. The physicist we consulted is likely to compute the mean collision times for the particles assuming equal masses, random starting positions, and uniformly random interactions, and say 'if that isn't good enough, then take your question to a computer. ${ }^{, 11}$\n","\n","None the less, physics has valuable concepts and techniques to contribute to the study of connectionist dynamical systems. Insights from physics have already proved important in various ways in the subsymbolic paradigm (Sejnowski, 1976; Hinton and Sejnowski, 1983a; Smolensky, 1983).\n","\n","Various sub-symbolic models have addressed various goals and environments. A very general goal that is of particular importance is:\\\\\n","(20) The prediction goal: given some partial information about the environmental state, correctly infer missing information.\n","\n","What is maintained here is the degree of match between predicted values and the actual values for the unknowns. Maintenance of this match over the wide range of conditions found in a complex environment is a difficult task. Special cases of this task include predicting the depth of an object from retinal images, the future location of a moving object, the change in certain aspects of an electric circuit given the changes in other aspects, or the propositions implied by a text. The prediction goal is obviously an important one, because it can serve so many other goals: accurate prediction of the effects of actions allows the selection of those leading to desired effects.\n","\n","A closely related goal is:\\\\\n","(21) The prediction-from-examples goal: given more and more examples of states from an environment, achieve the prediction goal with increasing accuracy in that environment.\n","\n","For the prediction goal we ask: what inference procedures and knowledge about an environment must a dynamical system possess to be able to predict that environment? For the prediction-from-examples goal we go further and ask: what learning procedures must a dynamical system possess to be able to acquire the necessary knowledge about an environment from examples?\n","\n","The goals of prediction and prediction-from-examples are the subject of many principles of the sub-symbolic paradigm. These are indeed cognitive principles. They will be taken up in the next section; first, however, I would like to consider some implications of this characterization of a cognitive system for certain foundational issues: semantics, rationality, and the constituent structure of mental states. It would be absurd to suggest that the following few paragraphs constitute definitive treatments of these issues; the intent is rather to indicate specific points where sub-symbolic research touches on these issues and to sow seeds for further analysis.\n","\n"]}],"source":["# Load a dataset from huggingface and map the dataset by the function above.\n","existing_argument_texts = load_dataset(\"ChickWard/ConnEli\", split = \"train\")\n","# View 3 random examples in the dataset.\n","\n","list_existing_argument_texts = []\n","for i in range(len(existing_argument_texts)):\n","    list_existing_argument_texts.append(existing_argument_texts[i][\"output\"])\n","\n","print(len(list_existing_argument_texts))\n","\n","for i in range(1):\n","    random_index = random.randint(0, len(list_existing_argument_texts) - 1)\n","    print(list_existing_argument_texts[random_index])\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":32,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739813111421,"user":{"displayName":"Sam","userId":"18172871330063317003"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"goTdRYtFOmn4","outputId":"7e7127d7-8636-45a7-a137-6f70fd0dd1b0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The median number of words is: 791\n","The average number of words is: 1002.680701754386\n"]}],"source":["# Step 1: Get the number of words in each string\n","word_counts = [len(text.split()) for text in list_existing_argument_texts]\n","\n","# Step 2: Compute the median of the word counts\n","median_word_count = statistics.median(word_counts)\n","mean_word_count = statistics.mean(word_counts)\n","\n","# Step 3: Print the median number of words\n","print(f\"The median number of words is: {median_word_count}\")\n","print(f\"The average number of words is: {mean_word_count}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":29,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739813111421,"user":{"displayName":"Sam","userId":"18172871330063317003"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"Tt2z2OwyJp_h","outputId":"5919f92e-2d52-407d-dfd8-889c7c03aebb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Indices of dictionaries to remove: [19, 22, 32, 36, 51, 59, 66, 70, 73, 82, 95, 99, 105, 110, 111, 114, 149, 151, 169, 182, 185, 189, 191, 192, 198, 199, 207, 211, 221, 230, 232, 239, 248, 251, 252, 255, 261, 270, 271, 276]\n"]}],"source":["# Step 1: Define thresholds\n","low_word_threshold = 200\n","high_word_threshold = 3200\n","\n","# Step 2: Identify indices of dictionaries to remove based on word count thresholds\n","indices_to_remove = [\n","    index\n","    for index, entry in enumerate(list_existing_argument_texts)\n","    if len(entry.split()) < low_word_threshold\n","    or len(entry.split()) > high_word_threshold\n","]\n","\n","# Print the indices of dictionaries to be removed\n","print(\"Indices of dictionaries to remove:\", indices_to_remove)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":26,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739813111421,"user":{"displayName":"Sam","userId":"18172871330063317003"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"3fK3EUvDLfXT","outputId":"d61f55cd-8a93-4f84-9e82-c8384f108084"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\\section*{1 The Projectable Features of Connectionist Psychology}\n","\\begin{quotation}\n","The moral here is that though there are indefinitely many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur just as well as Network A does, these networks have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory.

(1998) describe the field as having expanded its focus beginning in the mid-1980s. Previously, the field had spent 25 years concentrating on internalist, high-level GOFAI (\"good old-fashioned artificial intelligence\" [Haugeland 1985]), but it was finally moving \"outwards into the environment and downwards into the brain\" (Bechtel et al. 1998, p. 75). A significant force behind this downward movement was Patricia Churchland\\'s \"Neurophilosophy\" (1986). This book initiated a movement that truly came of age in 1999 when Kathleen Akins won a million-dollar fellowship to begin the McDonnell Project in Philosophy and the Neurosciences. The McDonnell Project placed neurophilosophy at the forefront of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, resulting in numerous articles, conferences, special journal issues, and books. In two major new books, neurophilosophers Patricia Churchland (2002) and John Bickle (2003) clearly feel this newfound prominence: Churchland mocks those who do not apply findings in neuroscience to philosophical problems as \"no-brainers,\" while Bickle mocks anyone with traditional philosophical concerns, including \"naturalistic philosophers of mind\" and other neurophilosophers.\\n\\nIn this review, I will examine these books by Churchland and Bickle from the perspective of the outward movement of cognitive science: situated, embodied cognitive science. Such an analysis is crucial as proponents of the situated, embodied movement focus primarily on environmental information, perception, and action, and have (sometimes correctly) been perceived as denying the importance of the brain in understanding cognition. Given the rise of neuroscience and neurophilosophy, such an attitude toward the brain is untenable. The plan is as follows: First, I will outline the different neurophilosophical programs, as embodied in Churchland\\'s \"Brain-wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy\" and Bickle\\'s \"Philosophy and Neuroscience: A Ruthlessly Reductionist Approach.\" Then, I will recommend a way for situated, embodied cognitive scientists to acknowledge the undeniable importance of neuroscience and neurophilosophy, demonstrating that it is possible to resist the brain-obsessive wave without becoming \"no-brainers.\"\\n\\n1. The first thing to note about these books is that they are both excellent defenses of reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Churchland and Bickle each claim that the progress of the neurosciences shows, and seems poised to continue to show, that mental entities and processes are identical to brain entities and processes. They also agree that this fact has profound implications for philosophical questions. This is more or less where the similarity between the two books ends. I\\'ll examine them in order.\\n\\nChurchland\\'s book is intended as a textbook, and it is an excellent one. It is introductory in that it presumes no background knowledge in philosophy or neuroscience. In some ways, it is simply an update of \"Neurophilosophy,\" rewritten to be more accessible for students and to account for advances in the neurosciences. It also broadens its scope: where \"Neurophilosophy\" focused on the philosophy of science and philosophy of mind, \"Brain-wise\" uses neuroscientific evidence to address issues from all over philosophy. (The book is divided into three large sections: metaphysics, epistemology, and religion.) Philosophically speaking, the new book maintains the pro-science, roughly pragmatist approach that made \"Neurophilosophy\" popular with scientists. The main philosophical advance in \"Brain-wise\" is the inclusion of and reliance upon Rick Grush\\'s emulation theory of representations (Grush 1997), more on which below.\\n\\nAs is appropriate in a textbook, Churchland is crystal clear about the nature of her approach, boiling it down to three hypotheses in the first chapter. The first hypothesis is the reductionist claim that mental activity is brain activity, and as such, is to be studied by neuroscientists. This claim, of course, is the heart of Churchland\\'s reductionism and follows a clear, though highly simplified, account of what reduction is. The second hypothesis is that cognitive science, i.e., the science of mental activity, is important to neuroscience because it tells neuroscientists what mental activity they need to account for while studying the brain. Cognitive science, that is, is the to-be-reduced theory. Churchland\\'s third hypothesis is that to understand the mind, one must understand the brain at all levels of organization. These hypotheses together provide a compelling recipe for conducting the traditional business of the philosopher. Start with a traditional philosophical problem. Be a good pragmatist/naturalized epistemologist and admit that the natural sciences are the best way to find a solution to it. If it is an epistemological problem, the answer is to be found in scientific studies of our minds as information processors, i.e., cognitive science. If it\\'s a metaphysical problem, either it can be solved the same way or is pointless mystery-mongering. Use results in cognitive neuroscience and/or brain imaging to account for the results in cognitive science. Repeat, accounting for the cognitive neuroscience in terms of cellular neuroscience. And so on.\\n\\nChurchland follows this recipe, more or less, throughout the book. Metaphysical topics like the self, consciousness, and free will are accounted for in terms of information processing in the brain. Epistemology is naturalized, so epistemological problems come down to how the brain represents and learns. Religious experiences are cast as misinterpreted brain squibs. My glib summaries don\\'t do justice to Churchland\\'s analyses of the issues, of course. Churchland has compiled an impressive array of cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience to make these cases, and all of it is explained clearly and patiently. You will learn a lot of cognitive neuroscience reading this book, and you will not be bored learning it. Indeed, one good reason to pick up this book if you\\'re a philosopher is for the cognitive neuroscience update. It is important, though, to notice the \"more or less\" in the first sentence of this paragraph. Churchland does follow the recipe for the first several steps, turning philosophical problems into scientifically tractable problems concerning the brain\\'s information processing. But, despite her hypothesis that it is important to understand the brain at all levels, she rarely touches on how the information processing she explains so carefully can be reduced to cellular activity or neurochemistry. These lower-level matters—the cellular, molecular, and genetic—are Bickle\\'s main focus.\\n\\nAiming to reduce the mental to the molecular is what makes Bickle\\'s reductionism \"ruthless.\" First, though, it is worth noting a more basic difference between Bickle\\'s book and Churchland\\'s. While Churchland\\'s book is intended for everyone from advanced undergraduates on up, Bickle is writing for graduate students and professionals. Bickle\\'s book is dense and, at times, difficult. This is, perhaps surprisingly, especially true when Bickle is writing about philosophy. Bickle\\'s writing is patient and exceptionally clear when he explains the ins and outs of long-term potentiation at the cellular, chemical, and genetic levels; he is less patient when discussing philosophical matters. Any reader, I think, could follow the neuroscience if they read carefully and, perhaps, have a neuroscience textbook handy. In contrast, only readers with graduate coursework in philosophy will follow all of Bickle\\'s first chapter on the nature of reduction. There are two explanations for Bickle\\'s differential presentation depending on the field of study. First, at the end of the day, the main audience for his book is professionals and advanced students in philosophy, along with a few philosophically sophisticated neuroscientists who are familiar with the details of the debate over reductionism. The second explanation is tied to Bickle\\'s main aim in the book, which is to argue that most work in philosophy of mind—including some of his own past work—really doesn\\'t matter. Bickle even wonders at several points (e.g., p. 116) why the world needs philosophers of mind at all. According to Bickle\\'s preferred approach to reduction, which he calls new wave metascience, we should simply take the word of neuroscientists when they claim to have reduced some bit of psychology to some bit of neuroscience. The change from being a philosopher of mind to being a new wave metascientist excuses one from worrying about replies to replies to replies to objections to theories of reduction. Indeed, one can stop worrying about any a priori barriers to reductionism and trust neuroscientific reductionism-in-practice.\\n\\nLooking at neuroscience as a new wave metascientist, Bickle finds that the reductionist action is not in cognitive neuroscience. Instead, he sees neuroscientists claiming to have reduced psychological processes directly to activity among genes and molecules, without an intervening reduction of the psychological to the cognitive neuroscientific. This is Bickle\\'s ruthless reductionism: psychological facts, laws, and generalizations are really molecular, neurochemical, and genetic facts, laws, and generalizations. Bickle exemplifies his \"mind-to-molecules\" reductionism most clearly with a detailed argument that the psychological phenomenon of memory consolidation (the production of long-term memories from short-term memories) just is long-term potentiation. Bickle\\'s argument is based both on the consensus for such a reduction among neuroscientists and on an impressive recitation of the data. Bickle wields this (purported) reduction with devastating effect against reductionist bugbears, especially for multiple realizability, widely held to be the reason that reductionism about psychology is implausible. Bickle begins his case against multiple realizability by changing the terms of the debate. As a new wave metascientist, Bickle is not interested in what psychology might be like on Mars or among angels; the new wave metascientist cares only about psychology in real creatures. Thus, the debate shifts from whether the mind is multiply realizable in merely imagined creatures to whether it is multiply realized here on Earth. At this point, we simply do not know enough about either psychology or neuroscience to tell whether psychological phenomena in general are multiply realized, but we do know enough about some phenomena. Bickle shows in impressive detail that the very same molecules and mechanisms involved in long-term potentiation (and memory consolidation) in mammals are also at work in both houseflies and sea slugs. Bickle takes this truly surprising identity at the molecular level in such evolutionarily distant animals as evidence that long-term memory is realized in exactly one way on Earth. This is good evidence that long-term memory, at least, is not multiply realized. The ruthless reductionist bets that the same is true of the rest of psychology.\\n\\nThis is exciting stuff, and in sharp contrast to the usual philosophical noodling and problematizing of the previously unproblematic. Churchland provides a plan for applying neuroscientific evidence to philosophical problems; Bickle applies it with a vengeance. Taken together, these books paint a picture in which real progress can be made on philosophical issues. Granted, the progress that Churchland and Bickle see is made by transforming the problems and then passing the buck to neuroscientists, and promising to put philosophers out of work. Despite the dimming job prospects for future philosophers of mind, it is hard to imagine preferring a static rumination over zombies, Martian psychology, and fading qualia to real answers. I, for one, am quite happy to join the battle against a priorism and endorse an increased role for empirical facts in philosophy. But, as I will argue in the next section, I think we need more facts.\\n\\n2. As compelling and frequently convincing as these two books are in their advocacy of the downward expansion of cognitive science, the proponents of the outward expansion must, at least partly, resist their allure. For although most proponents of situated, embodied cognitive science agree with Churchland and Bickle in their desire to apply results from the natural sciences to philosophical issues, they are not at all interested in reducing the mental to the neural. Indeed, this is the main point of situated, embodied cognitive science, which takes the object that requires explanation in psychology to be the combined brain-body-environment. What, then, should the situated, embodied cognitive scientist say about the undeniably good and important work done by Churchland, Bickle, and the neuroscientists whose experiments they cite?\\n\\nThe main strategy for the situated, embodied cognitive scientist here must be to insist that the mental, though not magical or non-natural in any way, is not confined to the head. This leads to significant disagreements with reductionist neurophilosophers. First, for psychology to be reducible to neuroscience, the psychological must be entirely in the head. Second, if the mental is all in the head, the way for the environment to impact the mind is by being mentally represented. The situated, embodied cognitive science proponent can deny both internalism and representationalism without deserving the epithets \"no-brainer\" or \"a priori philosopher of mind.\"\\n\\nSince the 1970s, there have been a priori arguments that internalism about the mental is problematic. Putnam and Burge, for example, famously argued that \"meaning ain\\'t in the head.\" Given the scorn that Churchland and, especially, Bickle show for thought experiments, we should not expect them to give up their internalism based on a priori considerations. Situated, embodied cognitive scientists, however, insist that psychology acknowledge a causal and explanatory spread outside the skull of the animal being studied. But to have a hope of convincing the neurophilosopher, or at least not provoking scorn, one must develop an empirical case against internalism. This has been the point of much work in situated, embodied cognitive science, whether by philosophers (Varela et al. 1991; Clark 1997) or psychologists (Gibson 1979; Thelen and Smith 1994). Recently, Charles Heyser and I have provided evidence that some research in neuroscience itself suffers precisely because it is internalist. We found that researchers who use the object exploration experimental paradigm with rodents to study the effect of drugs, genes, and neurotransmitters on behavior fail to take into account that the affordances of the to-be-explored objects, what actions the mice or rats can perform on them, dramatically affect the way rodents explore the objects. In many cases, experimentalists use objects with different affordances, e.g., some objects are climbable by rats, others are not. In such cases, the effects found in the experiments are just as likely to be due to differences among the affordances of the objects as they are to be due to the drug, gene, or neurotransmitter under study. That is, it turns out that, at least in some cases, when neuroscientists, behavioral geneticists, and psychopharmacologists assume that studying the brain is studying the mind, they conduct flawed experiments or misinterpret their results. (See Chemero and Heyser 2005.) We argue that to fix these misinterpretations, researchers must simultaneously investigate the brains, bodies, and environments of their animals.\\n\\nThis is also a problem for reductionism about the mental: if psychology is the study of the brain-body-environment, then neuroscience, which studies only what happens in the brain, is not a more general theory of the same subject matter as psychology. As such, we should not expect a reduction of psychology to neuroscience.\\n\\nAs internalists, Churchland and Bickle are also representationalists. Bickle\\'s representationalism strikes me as optional: if he thinks that the future of psychology and neuroscience is molecular, he has no need to worry about mental representations. And indeed, he spends very little time discussing them. Churchland\\'s focus on cognitive neuroscience (i.e., neural information processing), on the other hand, commits her strongly to representationalism. As such, issues of representation are at the forefront of her work, and explanations of how the brain might represent are crucial parts of her accounts of the self and of knowledge. As noted above, the main philosophical advance of \"Brain-wise\" over \"Neurophilosophy\" is in her adoption of Grush\\'s emulation theory of representation. According to the emulation theory of representation (Grush 1997), the most basic representations are forward models that provide the organism with a prediction of the outcome of its current action. Because they provide information about an animal\\'s own body, emulators are especially appropriate for Churchland\\'s discussion of self-knowledge, and she uses them to great effect there. Furthermore, there is evidence that something like emulators really are at work in the control of behavior in many species. (See Webb 2004, for example.) This might seem to be a problem for situated, embodied cognitive scientists, who are skeptical about the value of internal representations and typically deny that representations are required in motor control. But it is far from obvious that emulators, though they may be ubiquitous in action control throughout nature, really are representations. Representations, traditionally, are about the external world, while emulators are control structures that are about the body. If one is not a very strong internalist, taking the mental to be confined to the central nervous system, one can quite naturally understand emulators as simply an element in the system they are controlling. Compare: the gears of a clock control the motion of its hands without being a representation of that motion. Emulators are similarly attached to the body parts they control.\\n\\nThough I expect that Churchland, who clearly does feel that the mental is restricted to the central nervous system, would not accept this interpretation of emulators, she is open to the possibility that representationalism may not be the future of neuroscience. She mentions (though does not follow up) the possibility that dynamical systems theory might be a more appropriate language for neuroscience. Situated, embodied cognitive scientists ought to embrace this possibility. Dynamical systems theory is not only an appropriate language for understanding the activity of the brain, but it is also the key to understanding the brain as part of a brain-body-environment system. It is quite natural for dynamical systems models to have some parameters that are in the brain, some that are in the body, and some that are in the environment. Recent work by Bressler and Kelso (2001) and Thompson and Varela (2001) makes this point vividly. In both cases, dynamical systems models are shown to work both in brain-only explanations and in brain-body-environment ones.\\n\\n3. Research in the neurosciences is progressing exceptionally rapidly. It is thus quite natural for philosophers like Churchland and Bickle to hope that neuroscientists can help us to provide solutions to many age-old philosophical problems. They express that hope enthusiastically in their very different new works. The strength of their convictions and their arguments can be intimidating to those of us who agree that brains are important but don\\'t think they are the whole story. I hope to have made it convincing that one can easily resist the pull of the neurophilosophical wave without thereby being a \"no-brainer.\" To accomplish this feat, I offer the following three-step program for situated, embodied cognitive scientists: First, admit that brains are important; second, embrace dynamical systems modeling as the brain-friendly, but still non-internalist, means of explaining the activity of the brain-body-environment; third, do not, under any circumstances, make arguments based on Twin Earth, inverted qualia, or Martian psychology. The situated, embodied cognitive scientist can take results in neuroscience in stride by showing that they are best interpreted as shining light on a proper part of the larger brain-body-environment system.',\n"," '# Beliefs, Functionally Discrete States, and Connectionist Networks: A Comment on Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\n\\nCurrently, it remains uncertain whether connectionist models of cognitive function will align with the commonsense theory of propositional attitudes that many claim is evident in our folk psychology. William Ramsey, Stephen Stich, and Joseph Garon (in Greenwood [1991], pp. 93-119) have argued that it is at least questionable whether models inspired by certain connectionist hypotheses can be compatible with the propositional modularity that characterizes the central folk psychological state of belief. If they are correct, the success of such models (a matter for future research) would provide empirical support for eliminativism. I will argue that they have not demonstrated that these models pose any significant threat to the \\'Panglossian prospect\\' (Stich [1983], Ch. 11) of a smooth, ontologically conservative integration of folk psychology with cognitive science. On the contrary, there is an important aspect of the ordinary concept of belief that these models promise to align with quite well.\\n\\nThe point I intend to make is simple and modest. However, to understand the effort to revive faith in folk psychology, I need to recount the first part of the story similarly to Ramsey et al., beginning with an explanation of what they mean by \\'propositional modularity\\'. They define this as a cluster of claims, implicit in folk psychology, suggesting that \\'propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behavior\\' (Greenwood [1991], p. 97). The claim that commonsense psychology is committed to such internal etiological structure is, of course, controversial. Ramsey et al. provide three illustrative examples supporting the propositional modularity of folk psychology. One example is Davidson\\'s argument (Davidson [1963]) that since an agent might have two belief-desire pairs justifying a particular action, yet only one is the actual reason for acting, we generally attribute causal efficacy to the reasons for which agents act. A second, analogous illustration involves inference rather than action. A thinker has two distinct belief clusters, from either of which a further belief might be inferred. When the inference is drawn, folk psychology considers it an empirical question, typically with a determinate answer, from which set of beliefs the inference was made. The remaining illustration exemplifies that folk psychology allows a person to acquire or lose a single belief or memory. This case seems more questionable than the other two, given the apparently holistic character of folk psychological ascriptive practices. Despite this reservation, I do not dispute the claim that propositional attitudes are considered functionally discrete and causally active by folk psychology. The question is whether this theoretical commitment may jeopardize the future of folk psychology. Following Ramsey et al., I focus on belief, and there is no doubt that beliefs are semantically interpretable.\\n\\nSo, what are these connectionist models that may, if successful, threaten folk psychology? It\\'s time to present the main exhibit in the case for the conditional prosecution (i.e., conditional upon the success of connectionist modeling) of folk psychology. Ramsey et al. provide a trained-up specimen, making the discussion more concrete and simple enough for non-specialists to understand. Using backpropagation, they trained a three-tiered, feed-forward network with sixteen input nodes, four hidden nodes, and one output node on a set of sixteen distinct input strings. Taking an output higher than 0.9 as a positive response (\\'true\\') and an output lower than 0.1 as a negative response (\\'false\\'), a suitably generous interpretation of the inputs as encoding propositions allows us to regard the network, after training, as an information store or simplified memory model. The interpretations assigned to the sixteen inputs were a set of sixteen propositions, ten true and six false, about dogs, cats, and fish, such as \"Cats have paws,\" \"Fish have scales,\" and \"Dogs have fins.\" Since the assignments are largely arbitrary, there is no particular problem with input strings being taken as encoding propositions. We may find it helpful to think of a particular input as an interrogation of the network (\"Fish have fins?\") or an instruction to determine a truth-value by computation.\\n\\nThe trained-up network (labeled Network A by Ramsey et al.) with its various connection weights and biases is displayed in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the network\\'s response to the interrogation \"Dogs have fur?\" Ramsey et al. also report the striking result that when a second network with the same structure of units was trained on a set of inputs that included the encoding of just one additional proposition (\"Fish have eggs\"), they obtained a completely different set of weights and biases (their Network B—not illustrated; see Greenwood [1991], p. 110, for details).\\n\\nNetwork A \\'remembers\\' that dogs have fur. Why can\\'t it be thought of as having a single functionally discrete representational state with the content that dogs have fur? Certainly, there is some point to describing the network as informationally holistic. There is no specific area within the network where that information is stored; rather, the information is distributed throughout the network with its \\'trained-up\\' set of weights and biases. I cannot draw a circle around a particular part of the network and say: That\\'s where the information is retrieved from to give an affirmative answer to an appropriate input. The essential points Ramsey et al. make are that, firstly, several (and presumably in a more realistically complex model, very many) connection strengths, biases, and hidden units are involved in computing the input value for any given input string; and, secondly, any particular unit, weight, or bias encodes information about several (and presumably in a more realistically complex model, very many) different propositions.\\n\\nThat\\'s clear enough. But Ramsey et al. invite us to conclude that there is an incompatibility between the holistic distribution of information in the network and the propositional modularity of commonsense psychology. Yet it seems to me that the features of holistic distribution they emphasize do not establish the claim that the network does not contain (nor, in general, that networks of this kind cannot contain) functionally discrete representational states. The claim about functional discreteness was, quite evidently, never to be taken as a spatial claim: it did not say that intentional states occupy parts of the brain that other intentional states can\\'t reach because they mutually exclude each other. Folk psychology is surely not committed to intentional states being discrete in the same way as impenetrable physical objects—to being mutually exclusive residents of particular cerebral locations.\\n\\nI would suggest that what goes for cerebral locations also applies to the functional locations supplied by a cognitive model. There is no reason to impute to folk psychology a commitment to beliefs being functionally discrete in the very specialized and technical sense of being realized in a mutually exclusive way in the functional locations (e.g., processing units) of our best cognitive model. In accepting that intentional states (and, specifically, beliefs) are functionally discrete, we accepted that they had distinct causal roles in inference and the production of action. If we are not to foreclose the possibility that folk psychology is implemented on connectionist networks, we must allow that there may be different levels of functioning, and with different levels of functioning, we have different sorts of functional discreteness. To suppose otherwise would be to tacitly presuppose that only very simple mappings between folk psychological representational states and states of connectionist networks are admissible. That is not a presupposition that can be extracted from the causal role (Ramsey et al.\\'s propositional modularity) assigned to beliefs in folk psychology.\\n\\nIf we look beyond the basic functioning locations (processing units) supplied by the connectionist model, there is an obvious candidate to play the part of a functionally discrete representational state in networks like A, and that is the activation pattern of the hidden nodes. In the example given, this activation pattern is the 4-tuple (21, 75, 73, 12). This activation pattern is a unique state of the system, and since it does cause the output, it is qualified to be functionally discrete in the production of behavior and inference.\\n\\nRamsey et al. have heard this one before (listing it as objection 2b to their position) and have a counter-argument ready. Their reply is that activation patterns are not the sort of things that could be beliefs because beliefs and propositional memories are typically stable and enduring cognitive states. Consider your belief that kangaroos are marsupials (or dolphins are mammals, or Aristotle tutored Alexander, or whatever). You have had it for years, along with a host of other beliefs, and yet it probably has not been activated much recently until you just received that bit of input. A network can only contain a single activation pattern at any given time. So it cannot contemporaneously contain a multitude of beliefs realized as activation patterns.\\n\\nThinking this disposes of the suggestion that activation patterns could be equated with beliefs, they proceed to consider the suggestion that beliefs could be regarded as dispositions to produce activation patterns. We can discern these dispositions in the network in the set of weights and biases. These are enduring states, and so not to be rejected as candidates for belief-like status on the same grounds that activation patterns were. But, say Ramsey et al., they are not functionally discrete. The relations of connectivity in the network that are the dispositions to produce a given activation pattern (and its subsequent output) are the very same relations that produce different activation patterns in response to different inputs. So there can be no question of treating such dispositions as causally isolable in the production of inference.\\n\\nHere comes my very simple point. I suggest that as soon as we introduce a distinction between an active belief and a belief as a mere disposition, we can see that the alleged incompatibility between the way the connectionist network functions and the way folk psychology represents us as functioning simply disappears. Certainly, beliefs can persist as dispositions over long periods. But while they are dispositions, they are mere potentialities to think certain occurrent thoughts. While they are mere potentialities, there is no reason whatsoever to suppose that they are functionally discrete. They are not fulfilling any particular causal roles because they are not fulfilling any active causal roles at all. All we need to say, then (to deal with the problem from a Panglossian perspective), is that beliefs as dispositions are dispositions to enter states that are functionally discrete. Those states could be, for all we know, neural analogues of connectionist activation patterns.\\n\\nDistinguishing between active beliefs and beliefs-as-dispositions is not an ad hoc maneuver. It\\'s a distinction often resorted to in the philosophy of mind. It\\'s also a well-known story from the history of the philosophy of mind that some accounts of belief (e.g., Hume\\'s) fit active belief-episodes better, while other accounts (e.g., Ryle\\'s) fit long-term dispositions better. The general consensus is that we need to accommodate both. Perhaps folk psychology is not particularly well-equipped to mark the distinction, so we have to talk about \\'occurrent thoughts\\', \\'acts of judgment\\' on one hand, and \\'merely dispositional beliefs\\' and \\'longstanding belief-states\\' on the other. To render the distinction salient for theory of mind purposes, we may choose to stretch the normal vocabulary of folk psychology slightly. However, nobody has ever suggested that the availability of the distinction should, in itself, lead us to proclaim that folk psychology is radically mistaken.\\n\\nIf anything, the preceding remarks underestimate the extent to which the connectionist model presented by Ramsey et al. is congenial to the role of belief in folk psychology. For folk psychology (in its English idiom, at any rate) does have a way of observing the distinction, which philosophers of mind are liable to obscure through their penchant for using the term \\'belief\\' as a cognitive all-rounder. We should not neglect the more common psychological verb \\'think\\'. Talk of thinking that usually denotes an occurrent cognitive episode, rather than a long-standing dispositional belief. It is pertinent to note that one method of deciding a self-attribution of belief is to ask yourself the question \\'Is it true that p?\\'. You find yourself thinking \\'Yes, p is true\\' and are then ready to say \\'I believe that p\\'. (For the significance of this route to self-attribution in relation to the theoretical character of folk psychology, see Carruthers [forthcoming].) It does look as if Network A would model this process rather nicely, if only it could be equipped with some way of interrogating itself. At any rate, it seems clear that commonsense psychology has no difficulty in countenancing both occurrent belief and standing belief, even though it may sometimes mark the difference rather quietly (e.g., by use of tense, as in \\'he is thinking that\\' vs. \\'he thinks that\\'), and sometimes wrap it in a more elaborate context (as in \\'Of course I knew that all along. It\\'s just that it didn\\'t occur to me at the time\\').\\n\\nSo, at the present stage of our knowledge of such models, it does seem possible to regard connectionist \\'memory\\' networks as modeling both occurrent episodes of thought and the background retention of a stock of dispositional beliefs. Is there, however, a problem with taking long-standing dispositional beliefs to be realized in—in effect, to be stored in—the system of weights and biases of a connectionist network? It is certainly true that connectionist storage differs in several interesting ways from any system in which distinct contents are stored discretely. One such way is that a connectionist model of storage appears able to dispense with the distinction between core beliefs and dispositionally activated beliefs that any system of discrete storage is going to require. As Dennett pointed out (Dennett [1975]), any system in which beliefs are stored in a propositional or encoded form must acknowledge a limit on available neural storage capacity that is exceeded by the indefinitely large number of background beliefs that can be ascribed to an individual. This shortfall in storage capacity can be handled by postulating a stock of core beliefs which are augmented by the operation of \\'an extrapolator-deducer mechanism attached to the core library\\' (Dennett [1978], p. 45). Since a given set of weights and biases in a connectionist network can compute responses to a large number of propositions, including propositions that were not part of the original training set, connectionist storage is not committed to this distinction between core beliefs and other dispositional beliefs. To the extent that the distinction is motivated only by theoretical requirement (and that does seem to be the case), one could regard this as an economy of storage that counts in favor of connectionist cognitive modeling. This is, admittedly, far from being a decisive point in favor of connectionism, since some sort of extrapolator-deducer mechanism is going to be required anyway for cases of genuine inference. The fact that realizing that one has any of a multitude of background beliefs—such as (e.g.) that Zebras don\\'t wear overcoats in the wild, or that Australia is larger than the Isle of Man—does not involve conscious inference is, on our present knowledge of cognitive function, equally compatible with these being cases of holistic storage of information or cases of subconscious inference.\\n\\nBut what about the lack of stability in the set of connection strengths? As noted above, the inclusion of a single additional proposition in the training set generated a network (Network B) with a completely different set of weights and biases. The first thing to say about this is that we need to find out whether this is a general feature of connectionist modeling, or just a feature of mini-models like the one developed by Ramsey et al. An attempt at a more realistic modeling of memory storage would have to involve both a greatly enlarged training set and also some way of simulating the possibility of ongoing retraining. So far as I know, it is an open question whether larger and more realistic models would also be less unstable under retraining, although it is at least clear that the connection strengths must be sensitive to the acquisition of new information, in so far as this constitutes an addition to the training set rather than mere confirmation of something already computable (and hence already implicit within a set of weights and biases). But whatever further research reveals about that, I do not see why it should prevent us from considering dispositional beliefs to be realized in the weights and biases of a connectionist model. For the constraint that folk psychology imposes upon the realization of dispositional beliefs amounts, so far as I can see, to no more than this: that they should be realized in whatever state yields, upon activation, a causal role appropriate to the content of the particular belief in question. Any network that has been successfully trained up is going to satisfy that constraint because it is the criterion for successful training.\\n\\nMy conclusion is that there is no reason to suppose that the prospect of a connectionist modeling of higher cognitive functions is going to reveal that folk psychology is radically mistaken. Not yet, anyway.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{1.1 Connectionist Models}\\n\\nConnectionist models consist of extensive networks made up of simple, parallel computing elements. Each element holds a numerical activation value, which it calculates based on the values of neighboring elements within the network, using a straightforward numerical formula. These network elements, or units, affect each other's values through connections that possess a numerical strength, known as weight. The influence of unit $i$ on unit $j$ is determined by the activation value of unit $i$ multiplied by the strength of the connection from $i$ to $j$. Consequently, if a unit has a positive activation value, its influence on a neighboring unit's value is positive if the weight to that neighbor is positive, and negative if the weight is negative. In a clear reference to neural processes, connections with positive weights are termed excitatory, while those with negative weights are inhibitory.\\n\\nIn a typical connectionist model, input is provided by assigning activation values to the network's input units. These numerical values represent an encoding or representation of the input. The activation on the input units propagates through the connections until a set of activation values emerges on the output units, encoding the output that the system has computed from the input. Between the input and output units, there may be additional units, often referred to as hidden units, which do not directly represent the input or output.\\n\\nThe computation performed by the network, transforming the input pattern of activity into the output pattern, depends on the set of connection strengths. These weights are generally considered to encode the system's knowledge. In this regard, the connection strengths function similarly to a program in a conventional computer. A significant appeal of the connectionist approach is that many connectionist networks can self-program, meaning they have autonomous procedures for adjusting their weights to eventually perform a specific computation. Such learning procedures often involve training, where the network is presented with sample input/output pairs from the function it is intended to compute. In networks with hidden units, the network itself determines the computations that the hidden units will perform; since these units do not represent inputs or outputs, they are not explicitly instructed on what their values should be, even during training.\\n\\nIn recent years, connectionist models have been developed for a wide range of tasks, including vision, language processing, inference, and motor control. Numerous examples can be found in recent proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society meetings (Hinton and Anderson, 1981; Cognitive Science, 1985; Feldman et al., 1985; McClelland et al., 1986; Rumelhart et al., 1986b; see also Ballard, 1986).\",\n"," \"**1.2 Goal of this Chapter**\\n\\nIn light of the rapid advancements in the connectionist approach to cognitive modeling in recent years, it is premature to make definitive judgments about its power and validity. However, it is timely to attempt to articulate the goals of this approach, the fundamental hypotheses it tests, and its relationship with other theoretical frameworks in cognitive science. This chapter aims to provide a coherent and plausible articulation of these fundamentals. This task is non-trivial, as the term 'Connectionist' encompasses a variety of disparate and underdeveloped theoretical frameworks. The connectionist framework I will outline departs significantly from traditional approaches, making its relationship with other parts of cognitive science complex.\\n\\nFor now, I will refer to the formulation of the Connectionist approach I propose as PTC. I will not argue for the scientific merit of PTC here; such arguments are made elsewhere (e.g., McClelland et al., 1986; Rumelhart et al., 1986b). Instead, I aim to demonstrate that PTC offers a 'Proper Treatment of Connectionism': a coherent formulation that constructively connects with other theories in cognitive science. PTC is designed to be a strong cognitive hypothesis, comprehensive enough to face various challenges, and robust enough to withstand principled objections. If PTC achieves these goals, it will facilitate the critical task of assessing the scientific adequacy of the connectionist approach, determining whether it provides sufficient computational power for human cognitive competence and appropriate mechanisms to model human cognitive performance accurately.\\n\\nPTC responds to various positions regarding connectionism—supportive, critical, and neutral. These positions, often expressed orally but rarely documented, reflect a failure among supporters and critics of traditional approaches to engage with each other's views. Advocates of traditional cognitive modeling and AI often concede that connectionist systems are useful for modeling lower-level processes (e.g., early vision), implementing conventional AI programs quickly and fault-tolerantly, or understanding how the brain might implement LISP.\\n\\nThese neutral positions, I believe, fail to recognize the true challenge connectionists pose to the established view of cognition; PTC explicitly formulates this challenge.\\n\\nSome traditional approach supporters find the connectionist approach fundamentally flawed, arguing it offers nothing new (since universal Turing machines are 'universal') or fails to provide the explanations cognitive science requires. Others dismiss connectionist models as too neurally unfaithful. PTC is designed to withstand these criticisms.\\n\\nConversely, many existing connectionist models fail to engage with the traditional approach, partly due to a benign neglect. The connectionist literature often implies that traditional theoretical constructs like rules, sequential processing, logic, rationality, and conceptual schemata have no role in cognitive science. PTC seeks to assign these constructs their proper place within a connectionist paradigm for cognitive modeling. PTC also addresses foundational issues concerning mental states.\\n\\nAchieving PTC's goals requires adopting positions that some connectionists may view as premature or mistaken. These are inevitable consequences of the connectionist approach's underdevelopment and the term 'Connectionist' encompassing approaches with conflicting assumptions. PTC is not intended to represent a consensus view of what the connectionist approach is or should be.\\n\\nTo enhance clarity, I will clarify my position on the current value and future potential of connectionist models. This chapter is not a defense of all these views, though I will argue for several, and others have undoubtedly influenced the presentation. On one hand, I believe:\\n\\n1. (a) It is unclear whether connectionist models have sufficient computational power for high-level cognitive tasks; significant obstacles must be overcome before they can match symbolic computation.\\n   (b) It is unclear if connectionist models provide a sound basis for modeling human cognitive performance; the approach is challenging to align with empirical methodologies.\\n   (c) It is unclear if connectionist models can contribute to studying human competence; they are difficult to analyze for high-level properties needed to inform this study.\\n   (d) It is unclear if current connectionist models can model neural computation soundly; there are significant gaps between these models and current views of neural properties.\\n   (e) Even if connectionist cognitive science succeeds, many current cognitive science research strategies will remain viable and productive.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I believe:\\n\\n1. (f) The Connectionist approach will likely contribute significant, enduring ideas to cognitive science's theoretical repertoire.\\n   (g) Connectionist models will likely offer contributions to modeling human cognitive performance on higher-level tasks as significant as traditional symbolic models.\\n   (h) The competence/performance distinction from the connectionist approach will likely resolve a longstanding rift in the science and philosophy of mind.\\n   (i) Connectionist models will likely offer significant progress on the mind/body problem.\\n   (j) Given computational neuroscience's limited theoretical repertoire, connectionist models will likely stimulate the development of better neural computation models.\\n   (k) There is a reasonable chance that connectionist models will lead to new self-programming, massively parallel analog computers, and a new theory of analog parallel computation, potentially challenging the strong interpretation of Church's thesis that Turing machines exhaust the class of well-defined computations.\",\n"," '\\\\subsection*{1.3 Levels of Analysis}\\n\\nThe foundational issues surrounding the Connectionist approach largely hinge on the level of analysis adopted. The terminology, graphics, and discussions in most connectionist papers suggest that connectionist modeling operates at the neural level. However, I argue that it is more appropriate not to equate the principles of cognition explored in the connectionist approach with those at the neural level. The specification of the level of cognitive analysis adopted by PTC is a nuanced matter that occupies much of this chapter. While the level of analysis adopted by PTC is indeed lower than that of the traditional symbolic paradigm, it is, at least for now, more closely related to the symbolic paradigm than to the neural level. Therefore, I will refer to the cognitive modeling paradigm proposed by PTC as the subsymbolic paradigm.\\n\\nA few comments on terminology: I will refer to the traditional approach to cognitive modeling as the symbolic paradigm. Note that I will consistently use the term \\'symbolic paradigm\\' to describe the traditional approach to cognitive modeling, which involves developing AI-like computer programs as models of psychological performance. This paradigm has been articulated and defended by Newell and Simon (1976; Newell, 1980), as well as by Fodor (1975, 1987), Pylyshyn (1984), and others. The fundamental hypotheses of this paradigm encompass most of mainstream AI, including AI-based systems explicitly offered as models of human performance. The term \\'symbolic paradigm\\' is not intended to include competence theories such as the formal theory of grammar; while these theories are deeply related to the symbolic paradigm, they are not the focus of this chapter. Notably, much work in formal linguistics differs from the symbolic paradigm in cognitive modeling in ways similar to the Connectionist approach I will consider; on several dimensions used to differentiate the symbolic and subsymbolic paradigms, much linguistic research aligns with the subsymbolic side.\\n\\nTo move beyond superficial, syntactic issues, I have found it necessary to focus on a subset of the symbolic and connectionist approaches. On the symbolic side, I limit consideration to the Newell/Simon and Fodor/Pylyshyn view of cognition, excluding, for example, the perspective adopted by much of linguistics. On the connectionist side, I will consider only a particular view, the \\'subsymbolic paradigm,\\' excluding several competing connectionist perspectives. The only alternative is to characterize the symbolic and connectionist perspectives so broadly that substantive analysis becomes impossible.\\n\\nBy calling the traditional approach to cognitive modeling the \\'symbolic paradigm,\\' I emphasize that cognitive descriptions in this approach are constructed from entities that are symbols both semantically, referring to external objects, and syntactically, being manipulated by symbol operations. These manipulations model fundamental psychological processes in this cognitive modeling approach.\\n\\nThe term \\'subsymbolic paradigm\\' suggests cognitive descriptions composed of entities corresponding to the constituents of symbols used in the symbolic paradigm. These fine-grained constituents, which could be called subsymbols, represent the activities of individual processing units in connectionist networks. Entities typically represented by symbols in the symbolic paradigm are represented by numerous subsymbols in the subsymbolic paradigm. This semantic distinction is accompanied by a syntactic distinction: subsymbols are not manipulated by symbol operations but participate in numerical, not symbolic, computation. Operations in the symbolic paradigm that consist of a single discrete action (e.g., a memory fetch) are often achieved in the subsymbolic paradigm through numerous finer-grained numerical operations.\\n\\nSince the level of cognitive analysis adopted by the subsymbolic paradigm for formulating connectionist models is lower than that traditionally adopted by the symbolic paradigm, it is often important to analyze connectionist models at a higher level to relate these two paradigms. This involves amalgamating, so to speak, the subsymbols into symbols. Although the symbolic and subsymbolic paradigms each have their preferred level of analysis, the cognitive models they offer can be described at multiple levels. Therefore, it is useful to have distinct names for these levels: I will call the preferred level of the symbolic paradigm the conceptual level and that of the subsymbolic paradigm the sub-conceptual level. These names are not ideal but will be further motivated in the course of characterizing the levels. A primary goal of this chapter is to articulate a coherent set of hypotheses about the sub-conceptual level: the types of cognitive descriptions used, the computational principles that apply, and the relations between the sub-conceptual and both the symbolic and neural levels.\\n\\nThe choice of level significantly constrains the appropriate formalism for analysis. Perhaps the most striking feature of the Connectionist approach is the change in formalism relative to the symbolic paradigm. Since the birth of cognitive science, language has provided the dominant theoretical model. Formal cognitive models have derived their structure from the syntax of formal languages and their content from the semantics of natural language. The mind has been viewed as a machine for formal symbol manipulation, with symbols assuming semantics akin to English words.\\n\\nThe subsymbolic paradigm challenges both the syntactic and semantic roles of language in formal cognitive models. Section 2 formulates this challenge, describing alternative fillers for the roles language has traditionally played in cognitive science and delimiting the new role left to language. The fundamental hypotheses defining the subsymbolic paradigm are formulated, and the challenge that nothing new is being offered is considered. Section 4 examines the relationship between the subsymbolic paradigm and neuroscience, addressing the challenge that connectionist models are too neurally unfaithful. Section 5 presents the relations between analyses of cognition at the neural, sub-conceptual, and conceptual levels. It also previews the remainder of the chapter, which deals with the relations between the sub-conceptual and conceptual levels; the types of explanations of behavior provided by the symbolic and subsymbolic paradigms are then discussed. Section 6 tackles the challenge of accounting for conscious, rule-guided behavior within the subsymbolic paradigm. Section 7 addresses the challenge of distinguishing cognitive from non-cognitive systems at the sub-conceptual level. Various properties of subsymbolic mental states and the issue of rationality are considered. Section 8 briefly elaborates on the computational principles that apply at the sub-conceptual level. Section 9 discusses how higher, conceptual-level descriptions of subsymbolic models approximate symbolic models under their conceptual-level descriptions.\\n\\nIn this chapter, I have attempted to typographically isolate concise formulations of the main points. Most of these numbered points serve to characterize the subsymbolic paradigm, but a few define alternative points of view; to avoid confusion, the latter have been explicitly tagged with the phrase, \"To be rejected.\"',\n"," '### 2.1 Cultural Knowledge and Conscious Rule Interpretation\\n\\nHow can we appropriately formalize the knowledge that cognitive agents possess and the methods they use to perform cognitive tasks? To begin, we can examine knowledge formalizations that existed before the advent of cognitive science. The most structured knowledge is found in sciences like physics, which are grounded in mathematical principles. Domain knowledge is often expressed in linguistic structures, such as \"energy is conserved,\" and logic is used to draw conclusions from this knowledge. Knowledge consists of axioms, and drawing conclusions involves proving theorems.\\n\\nThis approach to formulating knowledge and drawing conclusions offers several valuable properties:\\n\\n1. **Public Access**: The knowledge is accessible to many people.\\n2. **Reliability**: Different individuals (or the same person at different times) can reliably verify whether conclusions have been validly reached.\\n3. **Formality, Bootstrapping, Universality**: The inferential operations require minimal experience with the domain to which the symbols refer.\\n\\nThese properties are crucial for science because it is a cultural activity. Knowledge that resides solely within one individual has limited social value (1). Knowledge that leads to different conclusions among users (e.g., disagreement on whether an experiment falsifies a theory) is of questionable social value (2). For the cultural propagation of knowledge, it is beneficial if novices with little or no experience can be provided with a means to perform tasks and thereby gain experience (3).\\n\\nOther cultural activities, such as national laws and organizational rules, also require similar formalization. These are linguistically formalized procedures that different people can execute with reasonable reliability. In all these cases, the aim is to create an abstract decision system that exists independently of any single person.\\n\\nAt the cultural level, the goal is to express knowledge in a form that can be reliably executed by different people, even those who are inexperienced. We can view the top-level conscious processor of individuals as a virtual machine—the conscious rule interpreter—and cultural knowledge as a program that runs on this machine. Linguistic formulations of knowledge are ideal for this purpose. The procedures that different people can reliably execute are explicit, step-by-step linguistic instructions. This concept is formalized in the theory of effective procedures (Turing, 1936). Due to property (3), the top-level conscious human processor can be idealized as universal, capable of executing any effective procedure. The theory of effective procedures—the classical theory of computation (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979)—is physically embodied in the von Neumann (serial) computer. The von Neumann computer can be seen as a machine for automatically following the kinds of explicit instructions that people can reliably follow, but much faster and with perfect reliability.\\n\\nThis understanding explains why the production system of computation theory, or more broadly the von Neumann computer, has been a successful model for how people execute instructions (e.g., models of novice physics problem-solving such as that of Larkin et al., 1980). In essence, when people (e.g., novices) consciously and sequentially follow rules (such as those they have been taught), their cognitive processing is naturally modeled as the sequential interpretation of a linguistically formalized procedure. The rules being followed are expressed in terms of the consciously accessible concepts used to conceptualize the task domain. In this sense, the rules are formulated at the conceptual level of analysis.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n\\n1. **Rules in Natural Language**: Rules formulated in natural language can effectively formalize cultural knowledge.\\n2. **Conscious Rule Application**: Conscious rule application can be modeled as the sequential interpretation of such rules by a virtual machine called the conscious rule interpreter.\\n3. **Conceptual Formulation**: These rules are formulated in terms of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain—they are formulated at the conceptual level.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{2.2 Individual Knowledge, Skill, and Intuition in the Symbolic Paradigm}\\n\\nThe constraints on formalizing cultural knowledge differ from those on individual knowledge. The intuitive understanding possessed by a physics expert or a native speaker may require a formalism that is not suitable for cultural purposes to achieve an accurate description. Individual knowledge, unlike cultural knowledge, is not publicly accessible or entirely reliable and heavily relies on extensive experience. It operates like a program on a virtual machine, which may differ from the conscious processor that manages cultural knowledge. By definition, conclusions derived from intuition do not stem from the conscious application of rules, and intuitive processing may differ significantly from conscious rule application.\\n\\nWhat types of programs govern behavior that does not involve conscious rule application? I will refer to the virtual machine executing these programs as the intuitive processor. This processor is likely responsible for all animal behavior and a significant portion of human behavior, including perception, practiced motor skills, fluent linguistic behavior, and intuition in problem-solving and game-playing—in essence, nearly all skilled performance. The shift of responsibility from the conscious rule interpreter to the intuitive processor during skill acquisition is one of the most remarkable and well-researched phenomena in cognitive science (Anderson, 1981). An analysis of knowledge formalization must consider both the knowledge involved in novices' conscious rule application and the knowledge inherent in experts' intuition, as well as their interrelationship.\\n\\nAn intriguing possibility is as follows:\\n\\n(4) (a) The programs running on the intuitive processor consist of linguistically formalized rules that are sequentially interpreted. (To be rejected.)\\n\\nThis has traditionally been the assumption in cognitive science. Native speakers unconsciously interpret rules, as do physics experts when intuiting solutions to problems. Artificial intelligence systems for natural language processing and problem-solving are programs written in a formal language for symbol manipulation.\\n\\nTo the syntactic hypothesis (4a), a semantic one corresponds:\\n\\n(4) (b) The programs running on the intuitive processor are composed of elements, i.e., symbols, referring to essentially the same concepts as those used to consciously conceptualize the task domain. (To be rejected.)\\n\\nThis applies to production system models where the productions representing expert knowledge are compiled versions of those of the novice (Lewis, 1978; Anderson, 1983) and to the majority of AI programs. Hypotheses (4a) and (4b) together form:\\n\\n(4) The Unconscious Rule Interpretation Hypothesis: (To be rejected.) The programs running on the intuitive processor have a syntax and semantics comparable to those running on the conscious rule interpreter.\\n\\nThis hypothesis has underpinned the symbolic paradigm for cognitive modeling. Cognitive models of both conscious rule application and intuitive processing have been constructed from entities that are symbols, both in the syntactic sense of being manipulated and in the semantic sense of (4b). Because these symbols possess the conceptual semantics of (4b), I refer to the level of analysis at which these programs provide cognitive models as the conceptual level.\",\n"," \"**2.3 The Sub-Symbolic Paradigm and Intuition**\\n\\nThe hypothesis of unconscious rule interpretation (4) is an intriguing concept that a connectionist approach to cognitive modeling typically dismisses. My aim here is to outline the connectionist perspective rather than debate its scientific validity, so I will not argue against hypothesis (4) directly. However, it is important to note that connectionists do not dismiss (4) lightly. Many prominent connectionist researchers have been deeply involved in efforts to make (4) beneficial for cognitive science. Connectionists often reject (4) because its acceptance has led to unsatisfactory outcomes for several reasons, including:\\n\\n(a) AI systems based on hypothesis (4) tend to be too rigid and inflexible to accurately model human expertise.  \\n(b) Articulating expert knowledge in rule form is impractical for many domains, such as common sense.  \\n(c) Hypothesis (4) has not provided significant insights into how knowledge is represented in the brain.\\n\\nThe motivation for exploring connectionist alternatives to (4) stems from the belief that these alternatives will better align with the goals of cognitive science. A thorough empirical evaluation of this belief is likely at least a decade away. One potential alternative to (4a) is:\\n\\n(6) The Neural Architecture Hypothesis: (To be rejected.) The intuitive processor for a specific task uses the same architecture as the brain for that task.\\n\\nDespite its appeal, this hypothesis is impractical for most cognitive models because we lack knowledge of the brain's architecture for many cognitive tasks. While there may be exceptions, such as visual and spatial tasks, hypothesis (6) is currently inadequate for problem-solving, language, and other areas.\\n\\nThese and other neural-level considerations will be explored further in section 4. For now, it is crucial to understand that connectionist modeling is not simply about aligning with the neural level. While most connectionist cognitive models do not operate at the conceptual level, they also do not strictly adhere to the neural level (see Anderson, 1987).\\n\\nThe goal is to develop a connectionist alternative to (4) that, unlike (6), offers a viable foundation for cognitive modeling. A preliminary version of this hypothesis is:\\n\\n(7) The intuitive processor has a specific type of connectionist architecture that abstractly models some general features of neural networks. (To be elaborated.)\\n\\nDeferring neural issues to section 4, we now examine the relevant type of connectionist architecture.\\n\\nThe connectionist architecture I propose is as follows (for more on this viewpoint, see Smolensky, 1986b). The numerical activity values of all processors in the network form a large state vector. The interactions among processors, governed by equations that dictate how the activity vector changes over time, are described by an activation evolution equation. This equation involves connection weights, numerical parameters that determine the influence of one activation value on another. The activation equation is a differential equation, often approximated by a finite difference equation from discrete time slices (discrete approximation is discussed in section 8.1). In learning systems, connection weights change during training according to a learning rule, another differential equation known as the connection evolution equation.\\n\\nIn a connectionist system, knowledge resides in its connection strengths. Thus, the first part of our elaboration on (7) offers an alternative to (4a):\\n\\n(8) (a) The Connectionist Dynamical System Hypothesis: The state of the intuitive processor at any moment is defined by a vector of numerical values (one for each unit). The processor's dynamics are governed by a differential equation, with parameters constituting the processor's program or knowledge. In learning systems, these parameters change according to another differential equation.\\n\\nThis hypothesis posits that the intuitive processor is a type of dynamical system, akin to those studied in physics, where the system's state is a numerical vector evolving over time according to differential evolution equations. The unique properties of this connectionist dynamical system are only vaguely described in (8a). A more precise specification is needed, but it is premature to commit to one. A significant class of sub-symbolic models is quasi-linear dynamical systems, discussed in Smolensky (1986b) and Rumelhart et al. (1986a). In such systems, each unit computes its value by calculating the weighted sum of its inputs and transforming this sum with a nonlinear function. An important goal of the sub-symbolic paradigm is to characterize the computational properties of various connectionist dynamical systems and determine which are suitable models for different cognitive processes.\\n\\nThe connectionist dynamical system hypothesis (8a) offers a connectionist alternative to the syntactic hypothesis (4a) of the symbolic paradigm. We now need a semantic hypothesis compatible with (8a) to replace (4b). The question is: what does a unit's value mean? The simplest possibility is that each unit's semantics are comparable to a word in natural language, representing a concept, with connection strengths reflecting the degree of association between concepts.\\n\\n(9) The Conceptual Unit Hypothesis: (To be rejected.) Individual intuitive processor elements—individual units—have semantics similar to the conscious rule interpreter's elements, namely, words of natural language.\\n\\nHowever, (8a) and (9) form an unproductive pair. Activation of concepts through association links may suffice for modeling simple cognitive aspects, like word naming times or letter perception probabilities, but it is inadequate for complex tasks like question-answering or grammaticality judgments. Such structures cannot be feasibly represented or effectively processed in this network.\\n\\nThe intuitive processor must possess significant computational power to handle complex cognitive processes. The symbolic paradigm, based on hypothesis (4), derives its power from allowing complex, arbitrary operations on symbols with conceptual-level semantics: simple semantics, complex operations. If operations are as simple as those in hypothesis (8a), we cannot rely on semantics as simple as (9). A semantics compatible with (8a) must be more complex:\\n\\n(8) (b) The Sub-Conceptual Unit Hypothesis: Entities in the intuitive processor with the semantics of conscious concepts are complex activity patterns over many units. Each unit participates in multiple patterns. (See Hinton and Anderson, 1981; Hinton et al., 1986; the neural counterpart is associated with Hebb, 1949; Lashley, 1950, as discussed in Feldman, 1986.) Interactions between individual units are simple, but these units lack conceptual semantics; they are sub-conceptual. Interactions between entities with conceptual semantics, involving complex activity patterns, are not simple. These interactions are not directly described by a sub-symbolic model's formal definition; they must be computed by the analyst, often only approximately. Generally, no precise, complete, computable formal principles exist at the conceptual level; such principles exist only at the sub-conceptual level.\\n\\n(8) (c) The Sub-Conceptual Level Hypothesis: Complete, formal, and precise descriptions of the intuitive processor are generally feasible only at the sub-conceptual level.\\n\\nIn (8c), the qualification 'complete, formal, and precise' is crucial: conceptual-level descriptions of the intuitive processor's performance can be derived from the sub-conceptual description, but unlike the sub-conceptual level, these descriptions will be incomplete (covering only certain processing aspects), informal (describing complex behaviors qualitatively), or imprecise (describing performance with approximations or idealizations like 'competence' idealizations away from actual performance). Explicit examples of these conceptual-level descriptions of sub-symbolic systems will be discussed in section 9.\\n\\nHypotheses (8a-c) can be summarized as:\\n\\n(8) The Sub-Symbolic Hypothesis: The intuitive processor is a sub-conceptual connectionist dynamical system that does not allow a complete, formal, and precise conceptual-level description.\\n\\nThis hypothesis is the foundation of the sub-symbolic paradigm.\",\n"," \"**2.4 The Incompatibility of the Symbolic and Sub-Symbolic Paradigms**\\n\\nIn this section, I will demonstrate that the symbolic and sub-symbolic paradigms, as previously defined, are inherently incompatible. Specifically, hypotheses (4) and (8) regarding the syntax and semantics of the intuitive processor are not mutually consistent. This issue requires careful consideration because it is well-known that one virtual machine can often be implemented within another, allowing a program written for one machine to be translated into a program for another. If each paradigm can simulate the other, distinguishing between sub-symbolic and symbolic computation might be futile. After all, a digital computer is essentially a dynamical system simulating a von Neumann automaton, and digital computers are frequently used to simulate connectionist models. Thus, it seems plausible that both symbolic and sub-symbolic hypotheses (4) and (8) could be correct: the intuitive processor could be viewed as a virtual machine that sequentially interprets rules at one level and operates as a connectionist machine at a lower level.\\n\\nThis possibility aligns with the symbolic paradigm under a formulation such as:\\n\\n(10) Valid connectionist models are merely implementations, for a specific type of parallel hardware, of symbolic programs that provide exact and complete accounts of behavior at the conceptual level. (To be rejected.)\\n\\nHowever, (10) contradicts hypothesis (8c) and is therefore incompatible with the sub-symbolic paradigm. While the symbolic programs hypothesized in (4) for the intuitive processor could be translated for a connectionist machine, the translated programs would not align with the type of sub-symbolic program hypothesized in (8). If (10) is correct, then (8) is incorrect; at the very least, (8c) would need to be removed from the defining hypothesis of the sub-symbolic paradigm, weakening it to the extent that connectionist modeling becomes mere implementation. Such an outcome would represent a significant setback for a research program that many connectionists are actively pursuing.\\n\\nWhat about the reverse scenario, where a symbolic program is used to implement a sub-symbolic system? It is crucial to understand that the symbols in such programs represent the activation values of units and the strengths of connections. According to hypothesis (8b), these do not possess conceptual semantics, thereby violating hypothesis (4b). The sub-symbolic programs hypothesized in (8) for the intuitive processor can be translated for a von Neumann machine, but the translated programs do not correspond to the type of symbolic program hypothesized in (4).\\n\\nThese arguments illustrate that unless the hypotheses of the symbolic and sub-symbolic paradigms are formulated with precision, the core scientific issue at hand can easily be overlooked. It is well-known that von Neumann machines and connectionist networks can simulate each other. This fact leads some to adopt the position that the connectionist approach offers nothing fundamentally new, as we already have Turing machines and, following Church's thesis, reason to believe that Turing machines encompass all computation. However, this position misconstrues the issue for cognitive science as a purely syntactic question of whether mental programs are written for Turing/von Neumann machines or connectionist machines. This is a non-issue. If one characterizes the two approaches solely in syntactic terms, using only (4a) and (8a), then indeed the debate—Connectionist or not Connectionist—appears to be 'one of AI's wonderful red herrings.'\\n\\nIt is erroneous to claim that the connectionist approach offers nothing new to cognitive science. The central issue at stake is whether the complete formal account of cognition resides at the conceptual level. The sub-symbolic paradigm posits: No—it resides at the sub-conceptual level.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{3 Representation at the Sub-conceptual Level}\\n\\nHaving proposed the existence of a sub-conceptual level, we must now explore its characteristics. Hypothesis (8b) raises significant questions about the semantics of sub-symbolic systems. What kind of sub-conceptual features do the units in the intuitive processor represent? Which patterns of activity correspond to specific concepts or elements within the problem domain?\\n\\nCurrently, there are no systematic or general answers to these questions; finding these answers is a primary objective of the subsymbolic research paradigm. Presently, each sub-symbolic model employs specific procedures to relate patterns of activity—activity vectors—to the conceptual-level descriptions of inputs and outputs that define the model's task. These vectors often represent fine-grained features of the inputs and outputs, based on pre-existing theoretical analyses of the domain. For instance, in the task studied by Rumelhart and McClelland (1986), which involves transforming root phonetic forms of English verbs into their past-tense forms, the input and output phonetic strings are represented as vectors of values for context-dependent binary phonetic features. The task description at the conceptual level involves consciously recognized concepts such as the words 'go' and 'went', while the sub-conceptual level used by the model involves numerous fine-grained features like 'roundedness preceded by frontalness and followed by backness'. The representation of 'go' is a large pattern of activity over these features.\\n\\nSubstantive progress in sub-symbolic cognitive science requires systematic commitments to vectorial representations for individual cognitive domains. It is crucial to develop mathematical or empirical methodologies that can adequately constrain these commitments. The vectors chosen to represent inputs and outputs significantly influence a model's predictions, as the generalizations the model makes are largely determined by the similarity structure of the chosen vectors. Unlike symbolic tokens, these vectors exist in a topological space where some are close together and others are far apart.\\n\\nWhat methodologies might be used to constrain representation at the sub-conceptual level? The methodology used by Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) in the past-tense model is one that has been widely practiced, particularly in models of language processing: representational features are borrowed from existing theoretical analyses of the domain and adapted (often in somewhat ad hoc ways) to meet the needs of connectionist modeling. This approach clearly makes the sub-symbolic paradigm dependent on other research paradigms in cognitive sciences and suggests that, at least in the short term, the sub-symbolic paradigm cannot replace these other paradigms. (This is a theme I will revisit in the conclusion of the chapter.)\\n\\nA second possible theoretical methodology for studying sub-conceptual representation involves the learning procedures that train hidden units in connectionist networks. Hidden units support internal representations of elements of the problem domain, and networks that train their hidden units effectively learn sub-conceptual representations of the domain. By analyzing the representations that such networks develop, we may derive principles of sub-conceptual representation for various problem domains.\\n\\nA third methodology views the task of constraining sub-conceptual models as the calibration of connectionist models to the human cognitive system. The challenge is to determine which vectors should represent various aspects of the domain so that the resulting behavior of the connectionist model aligns with human behavior. Powerful mathematical tools are needed to relate the overall behavior of the network to the choice of representational vectors; ideally, these tools should allow us to invert the mapping from representations to behavior so that, starting with extensive data on human performance, we can derive representational vectors. An example of this type of tool is the technique of multi-dimensional scaling (Shepard, 1962), which transforms data on human judgments of similarity between pairs of items into vectors representing those items. The sub-symbolic paradigm needs tools like a version of multi-dimensional scaling based on a connectionist model of the process of producing similarity judgments.\\n\\nEach of these methodologies presents significant research challenges. Most of these challenges are currently being pursued, albeit with modest success. In the first approach, systematic principles must be developed for adapting the featural analyses of domains from traditional, non-connectionist paradigms to the connectionist context. These principles must reflect fundamental properties of connectionist computation; otherwise, the hypothesis of connectionist computation contributes little to the study of mental representation. In the second methodology, principles must be discovered for the representations learned by hidden units, and in the third methodology, principles must be developed for relating choices of representational vectors to overall system behavior. These are challenging mathematical problems on which the ultimate success of the sub-symbolic paradigm depends. Sections 8 and 9 discuss some results related to these mathematical problems, but they are not yet robust enough to bear the necessary weight.\\n\\nThe next two sections discuss the relationship between the sub-conceptual level and other levels: the relation to the neural level is addressed in section 4, and the relation to the conceptual level is explored in section 5.\",\n"," '### 4 The Sub-conceptual and Neural Levels\\n\\nIn the previous section, we overlooked a straightforward approach to constraining sub-conceptual representations: examining how the brain operates. This brings us back to the earlier comment in section (7) and the broader issue of the relationship between sub-conceptual and neural levels.\\n\\nThe connection between sub-conceptual and neural levels can be explored both syntactically and semantically. The semantic question is: how do representations of cognitive domains, as patterns of activity over sub-conceptual units in sub-symbolic network models, relate to representations over neurons in the brain? The syntactic question is: how does the processing architecture of networks in the sub-symbolic paradigm compare to the brain\\'s processing architecture?\\n\\nThere is little to say about the semantic question due to the limited understanding of neural representation in higher cognitive domains. In connectionist modeling, such as language processing, the \"just look at how the brain does it\" approach doesn\\'t significantly advance the construction of a functional network. Consequently, in subsymbolic models of higher processes, the semantics of network units are more closely aligned with conceptual-level accounts than with neural accounts. Semantically, the sub-conceptual level currently appears closer to the conceptual level, with little evidence to suggest proximity to the neural level.\\n\\nThis conclusion contradicts the common belief that connectionist models are neural models, a view likely biased against semantic considerations in favor of syntactic ones. When focusing solely on processing mechanisms, the computation performed by sub-symbolic models seems more akin to that of the brain than symbolic models. This implies that syntactically, the sub-conceptual level is closer to the neural level than the conceptual level.\\n\\nAddressing the syntactic question: is the processing architecture of sub-symbolic models well-suited for describing neural-level processing? Table 2.1 outlines some relationships between these architectures. The left column lists plausible features of general neural architecture at the neuron level (Crick and Asanuma, 1986), while the right column lists corresponding features of connectionist dynamical systems in sub-symbolic models. Hits are marked with a \"+\" and misses with a \"-\".\\n\\nIn Table 2.1, the assumed correspondence is between neurons and units, and synapses and connections. However, making this correspondence precise is challenging. Does a unit\\'s activity correspond to the membrane potential at the cell body, the time-averaged firing rate of a neuron, or the population-averaged firing rate of many neurons? Since signal integration between dendritic trees likely resembles the linear integration in quasi-linear dynamical systems more than synaptic signal integration on a dendrite, should a connection be viewed as an aggregate contact on an entire dendritic tree rather than an individual synaptic contact?\\n\\nGiven the difficulty in precisely defining the neural counterparts of sub-symbolic model components and the significant number of misses in Table 2.1, it seems prudent to keep open the question of the detailed relationship between cognitive descriptions at the sub-conceptual and neural levels.\\n\\nHowever, it is undeniable that the sub-conceptual level is significantly closer to the neural level than the conceptual level: symbolic models share even fewer similarities with the brain than those indicated in Table 2.1.\\n\\nThe sub-conceptual level overlooks many neural features likely crucial to understanding brain computation. Nonetheless, it incorporates several neural computation features essential for understanding brain function. The general principles of computation at the sub-conceptual level, involving high-dimensional, high-complexity dynamical systems, must apply to brain computation; these principles are likely necessary, if not sufficient, for understanding neural computation. While sub-conceptual principles are not immediately applicable to neural systems, they are more readily applicable than symbolic computation principles.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n1. The fundamental level of the subsymbolic paradigm, the sub-conceptual level, lies between the neural and conceptual levels.\\n\\nAs previously stated, semantically, the sub-symbolic level seems closer to the conceptual level, whereas syntactically, it appears closer to the neural level. It remains to be seen whether this situation will resolve as the subsymbolic paradigm evolves. Mathematical techniques discussed earlier may provide insights into sub-symbolic representation, increasing the semantic distance between the sub-conceptual and conceptual levels. There are already indications that as new insights into sub-symbolic computation emerge and additional information-processing power is added to sub-symbolic models, the syntactic distance between the sub-conceptual and neural levels is increasing. In the pursuit of more computational power, architectural decisions seem increasingly driven by mathematical considerations rather than neural ones.\\n\\nOnce the position of sub-symbolic models in cognitive science is clarified, dismissals of specific sub-symbolic models due to their lack of immediate neural implementation or absence of certain neural features can be addressed. Two fallacies in such dismissals can be identified. First, sub-symbolic models should not be viewed as neural models. If the sub-symbolic paradigm proves valid, the best sub-symbolic models of a cognitive process should eventually be shown to be reasonable higher-level approximations of the neural system supporting that process. This provides a heuristic favoring sub-symbolic models likely reducible to the neural level. However, this heuristic is weak given the current confusion about precise neural correlates of units and connections and the state of empirical and theoretical neuroscience.\\n\\nThe second fallacy in dismissing a sub-symbolic model due to neural unfaithfulness lies in failing to recognize the role of individual models in the sub-symbolic paradigm. A model can contribute by providing evidence for general principles characteristic of a broad class of sub-symbolic systems. The potential value of \\'ablation\\' studies of the NETtalk text-to-speech system (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1986), for example, does not depend entirely on the model\\'s neural or psychological faithfulness. NETtalk is a sub-symbolic system performing a complex task. What happens to its performance when internal parts are damaged? This provides significant clues to the general principles of degradation in all complex sub-symbolic systems, principles applicable to future, more faithful models.\\n\\nThere are many neural models that seriously consider neural organization constraints, and for which an analogue of Table 2.1 would show nearly all hits. However, we are concerned with connectionist models for cognitive tasks, which typically possess the features displayed in Table 2.1, with perhaps one or two deviations. The claim is not that neural models don\\'t exist, but rather that they should not be confused with sub-symbolic models.\\n\\nWhy are neural models of cognitive processes generally not feasible? The issue is not a lack of brain data but rather that the data are often unsuitable for cognitive modeling. Our information about the nervous system tends to describe its structure, not its dynamic behavior. Sub-symbolic systems are dynamical systems governed by certain differential equations. If we knew which dynamical variables in the neural system for a cognitive task were critical and what the \\'equations of motion\\' were for those variables, we could build neurally faithful cognitive models. However, we typically know only static properties of hardware arrangement. Without knowing which structures support relevant dynamical processes and what equations govern those processes, we are like someone attempting to model the solar system with data on planetary colors but no knowledge of Newton\\'s Laws.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n\\n1. Unlike symbolic architecture, sub-symbolic architecture possesses several general features of neural architecture.\\n2. However, sub-symbolic architecture lacks many detailed yet general features of neural architecture; the sub-conceptual level of analysis is higher than the neural level.\\n3. For most cognitive functions, neuroscience cannot provide the necessary information to specify a cognitive model at the neural level.\\n4. The general cognitive principles of the sub-conceptual level will likely contribute significantly to future discoveries of neural computation specifications that we currently lack.',\n"," \"# Reduction of Cognition to the Sub-conceptual Level\\n\\nIn the previous section, we explored the relationship between the sub-symbolic paradigm's foundational sub-conceptual level and the neural level. This chapter will now focus on the connections between the sub-conceptual and conceptual levels, which have only been briefly mentioned earlier. Before delving deeper, it is beneficial to summarize the relationships between these levels, including those that will be further discussed in this chapter.\\n\\nConsider three physical systems: a brain engaged in a cognitive process, a massively parallel connectionist computer running a sub-symbolic model of that process, and a von Neumann computer executing a symbolic model of the same process. The cognitive process may involve conscious rule application, intuition, or a combination of both. According to the sub-symbolic paradigm, the relationships are as follows:\\n\\n1. Describing the brain at the neural level provides a neural model.\\n2. Describing the brain approximately at a higher level—the sub-conceptual level—yields a model that closely resembles the one running on the connectionist computer when it is also described at the sub-conceptual level. This is a goal for future research, and the approximation may be rough, which would still align with the sub-symbolic paradigm.\\n3. We can attempt to describe the connectionist computer at a higher level—the conceptual level—using patterns of activity with conceptual semantics. If the cognitive process involves conscious rule application, this conceptual-level analysis can be performed with reasonable precision, resulting in a description that closely matches the symbolic computer program on the von Neumann machine.\\n4. If the process is intuitive, a precise conceptual-level description of the connectionist machine is not possible. However, various approximate conceptual-level descriptions can be produced, corresponding to the symbolic computer program on the von Neumann machine in different ways.\\n\\nFor cognitive processes involving both intuition and conscious rule application, points 3 and 4 will apply to different aspects of the process.\\n\\nThe relationships in points 1 and 2 were discussed in the previous section. The relationship in point 3, between a sub-symbolic implementation of the conscious rule interpreter and a symbolic implementation, is discussed in section 6. The relations in point 4, between sub-symbolic and symbolic accounts of intuitive processing, are considered in section 9. These relations depend on certain sub-symbolic computational principles at the sub-conceptual level, briefly discussed in section 8. These principles introduce new foundational considerations for cognitive science, addressed in section 7.\\n\\nThe relationships can be better understood by reintroducing the concept of a 'virtual machine.' Describing the processing of one of the three physical systems at a certain level of analysis results in a virtual machine, denoted as 'system_level.' Thus, the relationships can be expressed as:\\n\\n- Brain_sub-conceptual ≈ Connectionist_sub-conceptual\\n- Connectionist_conceptual ≈ von Neumann_conceptual (conscious rule application)\\n\\nHere, '≈' signifies 'equals to a good approximation,' and '~' indicates 'equals to a crude approximation.' The two nearly equal virtual machines in the first relationship describe the 'conscious rule interpreter.' The roughly similar virtual machines in the second relationship provide the paradigms' descriptions of the intuitive processor at the conceptual level.\\n\\nTable 2.2 illustrates these relationships and the degree of precision with which each system can be described at each level. The levels included in Table 2.2 are relevant for predicting high-level behavior. While each system can also be described at lower levels, down to elementary particles, levels below an exactly describable level can be ignored for predicting high-level behavior. This is because predictions can be made at the highest level that can be exactly described, which is presumably more challenging at lower levels. In the symbolic paradigm, descriptions below the conceptual level are not considered significant for modeling high-level behavior, as the implementation of symbol manipulation is not a relevant part of the cognitive model. In a sub-symbolic model, exact behavioral prediction must occur at the sub-conceptual level, but the implementation of units is not relevant.\\n\\nThe relationship between the conceptual level and lower levels differs fundamentally between the sub-symbolic and symbolic paradigms. This leads to significant differences in the explanations each paradigm offers for conceptual-level behavior and the type of reduction used in these explanations. A symbolic model consists of interacting processes with the same conceptual-level semantics as the task behavior being explained. Using Haugeland's (1978) terminology, this systematic explanation relies on a systematic reduction of behavior without a shift in semantic domain or dimension. For example, a game-playing program comprises sub-programs that generate and evaluate possible moves. In the symbolic paradigm, these systematic reductions play a major role in explanation. The lowest-level processes in the systematic reduction, still retaining the original semantics of the task domain, are reduced by intentional instantiation: they are implemented by other processes with different semantics but the same form. For instance, a move-generation subprogram with game semantics is instantiated in a system of programs with list-manipulating semantics. This intentional instantiation typically plays a minor role in the overall explanation, if it is considered cognitively relevant at all.\\n\\nIn contrast, cognitive explanations in the sub-symbolic paradigm rely on reductions involving a dimensional shift. Accurate explanations of intuitive behavior require descending to the sub-conceptual level. The elements in this explanation, the units, do not have the semantics of the original behavior, as stated in the sub-conceptual unit hypothesis. In other words:\\n\\n- Unlike symbolic explanations, sub-symbolic explanations crucially rely on a semantic ('dimensional') shift accompanying the transition from the conceptual to the sub-conceptual levels.\\n\\nIn the sub-symbolic paradigm, the overall dispositions of cognitive systems are explained as approximate higher-level regularities emerging from quantitative laws operating at a more fundamental level with different semantics. This type of reduction is familiar in natural science, exemplified by explaining the laws of thermodynamics through a reduction to mechanics, involving a shift from thermal semantics to molecular semantics. Section 9 discusses explicit sub-symbolic reductions of symbolic explanatory constructs.\\n\\nThe sub-symbolic paradigm also repeals other features identified by Haugeland as newly introduced into scientific explanation by the symbolic paradigm. The system's inputs and outputs are not quasi-linguistic representations but traditional numerical vectors. These inputs and outputs have semantic interpretations, but they are not constructed recursively from interpretations of embedded constituents. The fundamental laws are traditional numerical equations.\\n\\nHaugeland made significant efforts to legitimize the form of explanation and reduction used in the symbolic paradigm. In contrast, the explanations and reductions of the sub-symbolic paradigm are well-established in natural science.\\n\\nIn summary, in the sub-symbolic paradigm, the conceptual and sub-conceptual levels are not related as the levels of a von Neumann computer (high-level language program, compiled low-level program, etc.). The relationship between sub-symbolic and symbolic models is more akin to that between quantum and classical mechanics. Sub-symbolic models accurately describe the microstructure of cognition, while symbolic models provide an approximate description of the macrostructure. An important task of sub-symbolic theory is to delineate the situations and respects in which the symbolic approximation is valid and to explain why.\",\n"," '\\\\section*{6 Conscious Rule Application in the Sub-symbolic Paradigm}\\n\\nIn the symbolic paradigm, both conscious rule application and intuition are conceptualized at a high level, representing conscious and unconscious rule interpretation, respectively. However, in the sub-symbolic paradigm, while conscious rule application can still be formalized conceptually, intuition must be addressed at a sub-conceptual level. This implies that a sub-symbolic model of a cognitive process involving both intuition and conscious rule interpretation would require two components utilizing distinct formalisms. Although this hybrid approach may offer practical benefits, it presents several theoretical challenges. How would these two formalisms communicate? How would the hybrid system evolve with experience, reflecting the development of intuition and the gradual reduction of conscious rule application? How would it account for the fallibility of human rule application, such as in logic? Moreover, how would it enhance our understanding of the neural basis of conscious rule application?\\n\\nThese challenges can be addressed by adopting a unified sub-conceptual-level analysis for both intuition and conscious rule interpretation. The virtual machine that interprets conscious rules should be implemented within a lower-level virtual machine: the same connectionist dynamical system that models the intuitive processor. This section explores how this can be achieved in principle and examines the relative advantages and disadvantages of implementing the rule interpreter in a connectionist dynamical system rather than a von Neumann machine.\\n\\nSection 2.1 highlighted the power of natural language in propagating cultural knowledge and instructing novices. Mastery of a natural language provides a powerful tool for performing in domains where experience is insufficient for developing intuition: verbally expressed rules, whether stored in memory or on paper, can guide a step-by-step approach to problem-solving. Once sub-symbolic models attain sufficient natural language processing capabilities, they can leverage this same tool. A sub-symbolic system with natural language competence can encode linguistic expressions as patterns of activity, which can be stored in connectionist memories using standard procedures. If these stored linguistic expressions are rules, the sub-symbolic system can use them to solve problems sequentially. For instance, if the rules stored in memory are production rules of the form \"if condition holds, then do action,\" the system can retrieve the relevant production from memory when the condition is met, thanks to the content-addressability of connectionist memories. The system must then interpret and execute the action described in the retrieved pattern, effectively implementing a production system using sub-symbolic natural language processing mechanisms. A connectionist account of natural language processes must eventually be developed within the sub-symbolic paradigm, as fluent speakers\\' natural language processes are intuitive and, according to the sub-symbolic hypothesis, must be modeled at the sub-conceptual level using sub-symbolic computation.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n(16) The ability to represent and process linguistic structures in a native language is a competence of the human intuitive processor. The sub-symbolic paradigm posits that this competence can be modeled in a sub-conceptual connectionist dynamical system. By integrating such linguistic competence with the memory capabilities of connectionist systems, sequential rule interpretation can be achieved.\\n\\nOur sub-symbolic system can utilize its stored rules to perform tasks. The standard learning procedures of connectionist models transform this task performance experience into a set of weights for mapping inputs to outputs. Over time, with sufficient experience, the task can be executed directly by these weights. The input activity generates the output activity so rapidly that the relatively slow rule-interpretation process does not have time to reinstantiate and interpret the first rule in memory before the task is completed. With moderate experience, some weights are sufficiently established to prevent certain rules from being instantiated, while others are not, allowing other rules to be retrieved and interpreted.',\n"," \"### 6.1 Rule Interpretation, Consciousness, and Seriality\\n\\nWhat about the conscious aspect of rule interpretation? Given that consciousness is often considered a high-level description of mental activity, it is reasonable to suspect that it reflects the broad structure of the cognitive dynamical system. This leads to the following hypothesis:\\n\\n(17) The contents of consciousness reflect only the large-scale structure of activity patterns: sub-patterns of activity that extend over spatially large regions of the network and remain stable for relatively long periods.\\n\\n(See Rumelhart et al., 1986c. Note that hypothesis (17) proposes a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for an aspect of the sub-symbolic state to be relevant to the conscious state.) The spatial aspect of this hypothesis has already been significant in this chapter—it essentially restates the sub-conceptual unit hypothesis, (8b): concepts that are consciously accessible correspond to patterns over a large number of units. The temporal aspect of hypothesis (17) is particularly relevant here. The rule interpretation process requires that the retrieved linguistically coded rule be maintained in memory during interpretation. Thus, the pattern of activity representing the rule must remain stable for a relatively long time. In contrast, once connections have been developed to perform the task directly, no correspondingly stable pattern is formed during task performance. This explains the natural loss of conscious phenomenology with expertise.\\n\\nIn this framework, the sequentiality of the rule interpretation process is not inherent to the architecture; rather, it is linked to our ability to follow only one verbal instruction at a time. Connectionist memories can retrieve a single stored item, and this ability is utilized so that the linguistic interpreter is not required to interpret multiple instructions simultaneously.\\n\\nInterestingly, this analysis also applies to nonlinguistic rules: any notational system that can be appropriately interpreted will suffice. For example, another type of rule might be a short series of musical pitches; a memorized collection of such rules would allow a musician to play a tune through conscious rule interpretation. With practice, the need for conscious control diminishes. Since pianists learn to interpret several notes simultaneously, this account suggests that a pianist might be able to apply more than one musical rule at a time; if the pianist's memory for these rules can simultaneously recall more than one, it would be possible to generate multiple musical lines simultaneously using conscious rule interpretation. A symbolic account of such a process would involve something like a production system capable of firing multiple productions simultaneously.\\n\\nFinally, it should be noted that even if the memorized rules are assumed to be linguistically coded, the preceding analysis does not commit to the form the encoded rules take in memory: whether phonological, orthographic, semantic, or otherwise.\",\n"," '**6.2 Symbolic versus Sub-Symbolic Implementation of Rule Interpretation**\\n\\nImplementing a conscious rule interpreter within a sub-symbolic system presents both benefits and challenges compared to an exact implementation in a von Neumann machine.\\n\\nThe primary challenge is the difficulty in representing and interpreting linguistic instructions at a sub-conceptual level, a task we currently cannot achieve. Most existing sub-symbolic systems do not incorporate rule interpretation, thereby missing out on the advantages outlined in section (2). These systems cannot utilize rules to verify the outcomes produced by the intuitive processor, nor can they independently explore new domains by generating their own experiences through rules; they require a teacher to provide this guidance.\\n\\nHowever, there are notable advantages to a sub-conceptually implemented rule interpreter. The integration between the intuitive processor and the rule interpreter is seamless, with extensive communication between the two. Understanding this communication can lead to the development of efficient hybrid symbolic/sub-symbolic systems with effective interaction between processors. This approach provides a foundational basis for exploring how rule-based knowledge can evolve into intuitive knowledge. Interestingly, in a sub-symbolic rule interpreter, the process of rule selection is intuitive. The rule reinstated in memory at any given time results from an associative retrieval process, which offers several benefits. The best match to the conditions of the productions is quickly determined, and even if no match is ideal, a rule can still be retrieved. This selection process is highly context-sensitive.\\n\\nAn integrated sub-symbolic rule interpreter/intuitive processor theoretically combines the strengths of both processing types. Consider such a system working on a mathematical proof: the intuitive processor would generate goals and steps, while the rule interpreter would verify their validity. The need for a serial search through possible steps, typical in a purely symbolic approach, is replaced by the intuitive generation of possibilities. The rule interpreter ensures strict adherence to inference rules, allowing the system to harness the creativity of intuition while managing its potential unreliability.',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{6.3 Two Types of Knowledge - One Knowledge Medium}\\n\\nMost existing sub-symbolic systems perform tasks without the need for serial rule interpretation. Instead, patterns of activity representing inputs are directly transformed, possibly through multiple layers of units, into patterns of activity representing outputs. The connections facilitating this transformation embody a form of task knowledge that can be applied with massive parallelism, which I will refer to as $P$-knowledge. For instance, the $P$-knowledge in a native speaker likely encodes lexical, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic constraints in such a way that all these constraints can be satisfied in parallel during comprehension and generation.\\n\\nThe connectionist implementation of sequential rule interpretation, as described above, reveals a second form of knowledge in a sub-symbolic system. The stored activity patterns that represent rules also constitute task knowledge, which I will call $S$-knowledge. Like $P$-knowledge, $S$-knowledge is embedded in connections: these connections enable part of a rule to reinstantiate the entire rule. However, unlike $P$-knowledge, $S$-knowledge cannot be used with massive parallelism. For example, a novice speaker of a language cannot simultaneously satisfy the constraints contained in two memorized rules; they must be serially reinstantiated as patterns of activity and interpreted separately. Of course, the connections responsible for reinstantiating these memories operate in parallel, and indeed these connections have the potential to reinstantiate either of the two memorized rules. However, these connections are arranged so that only one rule can be reinstantiated at a time. The retrieval of each rule is a parallel process, but satisfying the constraints within the two rules is a serial process. After considerable experience, $P$-knowledge is created: connections that can simultaneously satisfy the constraints represented by the two rules.\\n\\nCreating $P$-knowledge is considerably more challenging than acquiring $S$-knowledge. Encoding a constraint in connections so that it can be satisfied in parallel with thousands of others is not an easy task. Such encoding can only be learned through extensive experience, where the constraint has appeared in many different contexts, allowing the connections enforcing the constraint to be tuned to operate in parallel with those enforcing a wide variety of other constraints. $S$-knowledge can be acquired much more rapidly, once the linguistic skills on which it depends have been encoded into $P$-knowledge. For example, simply reciting a verbal rule repeatedly will usually suffice to store it in memory, at least temporarily.\\n\\nThe fact that $P$-knowledge is highly context-dependent, while the rules of $S$-knowledge are essentially context-independent, is an important computational aspect underlying many psychological explanations offered by sub-symbolic models. Consider, for example, Rumelhart and McClelland\\'s (1986) model of the U-shaped curve for past-tense production in children. The phenomenon is striking: a child is observed using \"goed\" and \"mented\" when, at a much younger age, \"went\" was reliably used. This is surprising because we tend to think that such linguistic abilities rest on knowledge encoded in some context-independent form, such as \"the past tense of \\'go\\' is \\'went\\'.\" Why should a child lose such a rule once acquired? A traditional answer involves the acquisition of a different context-independent rule, such as \"the past tense of $x$ is $x \\\\times ed$,\" which, for one reason or another, takes precedence. However, the point here is that there is nothing surprising about the phenomenon when the underlying knowledge is assumed to be context-dependent rather than context-independent. The young child has a small vocabulary of largely irregular verbs. The connections implementing this $P$-knowledge reliably produce the large pattern of activity representing \"went,\" as well as those representing a small number of other past-tense forms. Informally, we can say that the connections producing \"went\" do so in the context of other vocabulary items also stored in the same connections. There is no guarantee that these connections will produce \"went\" in the context of a different vocabulary. As the child acquires additional vocabulary items, most of which are regular, the context changes dramatically. Connections that were adequate for creating \"went\" in the old context now have to work in a context where very strong connections are trying to create forms ending in \"-ed\"; the old connections are not up to the new task. Only through extensive experience trying to produce \"went\" in the new context of many regular verbs can the old connections be modified to work in the new context. In particular, strong new connections must be added that, when the input pattern encodes \"go,\" cancel the \"-ed\" in the output; these were not needed before.\\n\\nThese observations about context-dependence can also be framed in terms of inference. If we regard the child as using knowledge to infer the correct answer \"went,\" then we can say that after the child has added more knowledge (about new verbs), the ability to make the correct inference is lost. In this sense, the child\\'s inference process is non-monotonic—perhaps this is why we find the phenomenon surprising. As will be discussed in section 8, non-monotonicity is a fundamental property of sub-symbolic inference.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n(18) (a) Knowledge in sub-symbolic systems can take two forms, both residing in the connections.\\n(b) The knowledge used by the conscious rule interpreter lies in connections that reinstantiate patterns encoding rules; task constraints are coded in context-independent rules and satisfied serially.\\n(c) The knowledge used in intuitive processing lies in connections that constitute highly context-dependent encodings of task constraints that can be satisfied with massive parallelism.\\n(d) Learning such encodings requires extensive experience.',\n"," '# Sub-symbolic Definition of Cognitive Systems and Foundational Issues\\n\\nTo properly consider the sub-conceptual level as a legitimate domain for cognitive science, it is essential that the principles established at this level genuinely reflect principles of cognition. Sub-symbolic principles differ from both conceptual-level and neural-level principles, making it unclear what kind of cognitive principles they represent. Sub-symbolic models are structured as dynamical systems, but how do these models embody cognitive principles rather than merely principles of physics?\\n\\nWhat sets cognitive dynamical systems apart from non-cognitive ones? Currently, the dynamical systems explored in connectionist cognitive science lack what could be termed an intentional psychology. However, it is still possible to differentiate the dynamical systems studied in connectionist cognitive science from those traditionally examined in physics, affirming that the questions being addressed are indeed cognitive in nature.\\n\\nA key characteristic of cognitive systems, broadly defined, is their ability to maintain a significant number of goal conditions at a relatively constant level across diverse environments. Here, \\'goal\\' is used in a teleological sense rather than an intentional one. For instance, a river is a complex dynamical system that responds to its environment, but it primarily satisfies the condition of flowing downhill. In contrast, a cockroach can maintain its nutritional intake, reproductive needs, oxygen intake, and even its likelihood of survival across a wide range of environments. The variety of conditions humans can satisfy and the range of environments in which they can maintain this constancy reflect the measure of human cognitive capacity.\\n\\n**Cognitive System Definition:** A necessary condition for a dynamical system to be considered cognitive is its ability to maintain numerous goal conditions across a wide variety of environmental conditions. The broader the range of goals and environmental conditions a system can handle, the greater its cognitive capacity.\\n\\nComplexity is a crucial factor here. A river or a thermostat is not considered a cognitive dynamical system because it cannot satisfy a wide range of goals under diverse conditions. Complexity largely distinguishes the dynamical systems studied in the sub-symbolic paradigm from those traditionally studied in physics. Connectionist dynamical systems exhibit significant complexity, with high information content in their weights. Investigating how a connectionist dynamical system can achieve complex goals in complex environments involves addressing complexity in dynamical systems, a challenge traditionally avoided in physics. In cognitive modeling, many fundamental questions concern the detailed dynamics of a specific pattern of activation in a system with a particular initial state and a set of highly non-homogeneous interaction strengths. This is akin to asking a physicist: \"Suppose we have a gas with 10,000 particles, each with different masses and forces between them, starting at rest in specific positions. What are the trajectories of 20 selected particles?\" While this is a question about a dynamical system and, in a sense, a question of physics, it is typically avoided in physics. A physicist might calculate mean collision times assuming equal masses, random starting positions, and uniformly random interactions, suggesting that if more precision is needed, the question should be addressed with computational methods.\\n\\nNevertheless, physics offers valuable concepts and techniques for studying connectionist dynamical systems. Insights from physics have already proven important in the sub-symbolic paradigm (Sejnowski, 1976; Hinton and Sejnowski, 1983a; Smolensky, 1983).\\n\\nVarious sub-symbolic models have tackled different goals and environments. A particularly important general goal is:\\n\\n**The Prediction Goal:** Given partial information about the environmental state, correctly infer missing information.\\n\\nThis goal involves maintaining a match between predicted and actual values for unknowns across a wide range of conditions in a complex environment, a challenging task. Specific instances include predicting the depth of an object from retinal images, the future location of a moving object, changes in an electric circuit, or propositions implied by a text. The prediction goal is crucial because it supports many other goals: accurate prediction of action effects enables the selection of actions leading to desired outcomes.\\n\\nA related goal is:\\n\\n**The Prediction-from-Examples Goal:** Given increasing examples of states from an environment, achieve the prediction goal with greater accuracy in that environment.\\n\\nFor the prediction goal, we ask what inference procedures and environmental knowledge a dynamical system must possess to predict that environment. For the prediction-from-examples goal, we further inquire about the learning procedures a dynamical system must have to acquire necessary environmental knowledge from examples.\\n\\nThe goals of prediction and prediction-from-examples are central to many principles of the sub-symbolic paradigm, which are indeed cognitive principles. These will be explored in the next section. However, I would first like to consider some implications of this characterization of a cognitive system for foundational issues such as semantics, rationality, and the constituent structure of mental states. While the following paragraphs do not offer definitive treatments of these issues, they aim to highlight specific points where sub-symbolic research intersects with these topics and to inspire further analysis.',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{7.1 Semantics and Rationality in the Sub-Symbolic Paradigm}\\n\\nThe sub-symbolic characterization of cognitive systems inherently links these systems to both environmental states and goal conditions. This connection raises the question: how do states within a sub-symbolic system acquire their meanings and truth conditions? A potential answer is suggested by the following hypothesis:\\n\\n(22) Sub-symbolic Semantics: A cognitive system adopts various internal states in response to different environmental conditions. When the cognitive system successfully meets its goal conditions across these environments, its internal states serve as accurate representations of the corresponding environmental states, relative to the specified goal conditions.\\n\\nFor instance, in the context of prediction, a state within the sub-symbolic system is considered an accurate representation of the current environmental state if it results in correct predictions.\\n\\nAccording to hypothesis (22), pinpointing a failure in accurate representation is not feasible. Each state is part of a broader causal network, and failures to meet goal conditions cannot typically be attributed to any single state or component. This issue, known as the \"assignment of blame problem\" (Minsky, 1963), poses a significant challenge in manually programming sub-symbolic models. Addressing this problem is a key achievement of automatic network programming procedures, particularly the learning processes within the sub-symbolic paradigm.\\n\\nThe characterization of cognitive systems also pertains to rationality. How can one construct a rational machine? How can internal processes, such as inference, be ensured to maintain accurate semantic relationships, like truth preservation? These questions translate to: how can connection strengths be adjusted so that the sub-symbolic system achieves its goal conditions? The scientific advancements of the sub-symbolic paradigm provide answers, offering specific procedures for programming machines to meet certain objectives, especially through learning procedures aimed at adaptation goals like prediction from examples.\\n\\nLet\\'s compare this sub-symbolic approach to veridicality with a symbolic approach to truth preservation, as proposed by Fodor (1975, 1987). In the realm of model-theoretic semantics for symbolic formulae, proof theory offers a set of symbol manipulations (rules of inference) that ensure truth conditions are preserved. Thus, if an agent knows $p \\\\rightarrow q$ and also knows $p$, syntactic operations allow the agent to deduce $q$; proof theory ensures that the truth conditions of the agent\\'s knowledge or beliefs remain unchanged.\\n\\nThere are direct sub-symbolic counterparts to this proof-theoretic account. In sub-symbolic systems, the role of logical inference is assumed by statistical inference. By formalizing tasks like prediction as statistical inference tasks, it is possible to demonstrate that sub-symbolic computation is valid in a manner comparable to symbolic proof. Further exploration of this topic will be presented in section 9.1, following a detailed examination of the computational framework of the sub-symbolic paradigm, which is the focus of section 8.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the proof-theoretic account explains the tautological inference of $q$ from $p$ and $p \\\\rightarrow q$, but it relies on an independent module to explain how the agent acquired the knowledge $p \\\\rightarrow q$ that justifies the inference from $p$ to $q$. In the sub-symbolic account, the veridicality problem is inextricably linked to the environment in which the agent seeks to fulfill its goal conditions—sub-symbolic semantics is inherently situated. The sub-symbolic analysis of veridicality involves fundamental questions: how can a cognitive system be placed in a novel environment and learn to form accurate internal representations that enable valid inferences about that environment, thereby satisfying goal conditions? How can it gather information from its environment? These are precisely the questions addressed by sub-symbolic learning procedures.\\n\\nIn the sub-symbolic context, the internal processing mechanisms (appropriately termed inference procedures) do not directly depend causally on the environmental state that may be internally represented or on the accuracy of that representation. In this sense, they are as formal as syntactic symbol manipulations. The ability of a sub-symbolic system to generate accurate representations of the environment (e.g., make valid predictions) results from extracting information from the environment and encoding it internally through a learning procedure.',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{7.2 Constituent Structure of Mental States}\\n\\nFodor and Pylyshyn have argued (e.g., Fodor, 1975; Pylyshyn, 1984) that mental states must possess a constituent structure, using this argument against the Connectionist approach (see Chapter 3). However, their argument is applicable only to ultra-local connectionist models (Ballard and Hayes, 1984) and does not pertain to the distributed connectionist systems discussed here. In a sub-symbolic system, a mental state is a pattern of activity with a constituent structure that can be analyzed at both conceptual and sub-conceptual levels. This section offers some general observations on this issue. The connectionist representation of complex structures is an active area of research (Touretzky, 1986; Smolensky, 1987), and many challenging problems remain to be solved (for further discussion, see Smolensky, 1988).\\n\\nAt the conceptual level, a connectionist mental state contains constituent sub-patterns with conceptual interpretations. During a debate over the connectionist approach at the 1984 meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, Pylyshyn suggested a method to extract these conceptual constituents using the following example: the connectionist representation of coffee is the representation of a cup with coffee minus the representation of a cup without coffee. To illustrate this, imagine a basic but adequate form of distributed semantic representation, where the interpretation of a cup with coffee involves the activity of network units representing features like brown liquid with a flat top surface, brown liquid with curved sides and bottom surface, brown liquid contacting porcelain, hot liquid, upright container with a handle, burnt odor, and so forth. Although sub-conceptual features should ideally be used, these features are sufficiently low-level to make the point. Following Pylyshyn\\'s suggestion, we take the representation of the interpretation of a cup with coffee and subtract from it the representation of the interpretation of a cup without coffee, leaving the representation of coffee. What remains is a pattern of activity with active features such as brown liquid with a flat top surface, brown liquid with curved sides and bottom surface, brown liquid contacting porcelain, hot liquid, and burnt odor. This represents coffee, in some sense—but coffee in the context of a cup.\\n\\nIn applying Pylyshyn\\'s procedure to determine the connectionist representation of coffee, there is no necessity to start with a cup with coffee; one could start with a can with coffee, a tree with coffee, or a man with coffee, and subtract the corresponding representation of X without coffee. Reflecting on the distributed featural representation, it is evident that each of these procedures yields a different result for \\'the\\' connectionist representation of coffee. The pattern representing coffee in the context of a cup is quite different from the pattern representing coffee in the context of a can, tree, or man.\\n\\nThe pattern representing a cup with coffee can be decomposed into conceptual-level constituents, one for coffee and another for a cup. This decomposition differs in two significant ways from the decomposition of the symbolic expression \"cup with coffee\" into the three constituents: coffee, cup, and with. First, the decomposition is quite approximate. The pattern of features representing a cup with coffee may possess a sub-pattern identifiable with coffee and another with a cup, but these sub-patterns are generally not precisely defined, and features typically remain that can only be identified with the interaction of the two (e.g., brown liquid contacting porcelain). Secondly, whatever sub-pattern is identified with coffee, unlike the symbol \"coffee,\" it is a context-dependent constituent, heavily influenced by the structure of which it is a part.\\n\\nThese constituent sub-patterns representing coffee in varying contexts are activity vectors that are not identical but possess a rich structure of commonalities and differences (a family resemblance, one might say). The commonalities directly contribute to the common processing implications of the interpretations of these various phrases, so the approximate equivalence of the coffee vectors across contexts plays a functional role in sub-symbolic processing that closely resembles the role played by the exact equivalence of coffee tokens across different contexts in a symbolic processing system.\\n\\nThe conceptual-level constituents of mental states are activity vectors, which themselves have constituent structures at the sub-conceptual level: the individual units\\' activities. To summarize the relationship between these notions of constituent structure in the symbolic and sub-symbolic paradigms, let\\'s call each coffee vector the (Connectionist) symbol for coffee in the given context. Then we can say that the context alters the internal structure of the symbol; the activities of the sub-conceptual units that comprise the symbol—its sub-symbols—change across contexts. In the symbolic paradigm, a symbol is effectively contextualized by surrounding it with other symbols in some larger structure. In other words:\\n\\n(23) Symbols and Context Dependence: In the symbolic paradigm, the context of a symbol is manifest around it and consists of other symbols; in the sub-symbolic paradigm, the context of a symbol is manifest inside it and consists of sub-symbols.\\n\\n(Compare Hofstadter, 1979, 1985a, b)',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{8.1 Continuity}\\n\\nAccording to (8a), a connectionist dynamical system operates within a continuous state space and evolves continuously over time. In this section, I will elaborate on the assumption of continuity, as it is crucial for understanding sub-symbolic computation. Readers familiar with connectionist models may question how this assumption aligns with certain apparent counter-examples.\\n\\nIn the symbolic paradigm, many cognitive processes are typically formalized with discrete characteristics:\\n\\n(24) \\n(a) Discrete memory locations, where items are stored without interaction.\\n(b) Discrete memory storage and retrieval operations, where items are stored or retrieved in a single, atomic operation.\\n(c) Discrete learning operations, where new rules are adopted in an all-or-none manner.\\n(d) Discrete inference operations, where conclusions are reached in an all-or-none fashion.\\n(e) Discrete categories, where items either belong or do not belong.\\n(f) Discrete production rules, with conditions that are either met or not, and actions that either execute or do not.\\n\\nThese discrete features are inherent in the symbolic paradigm, though they can be softened by explicitly incorporating mechanisms to do so.\\n\\nClearly, (24) offers a simplistic view of cognitive behavior. Cognition is a complex interplay of graded, continuous processes and discrete, all-or-none processes. One modeling approach is to propose separate discrete and continuous processors that interact. However, as discussed in section 6, this approach presents theoretical challenges, advocating instead for a unified formalism. It is challenging to distinctly separate the soft and hard components of processing. Alternatively, one could adopt a symbolic approach and manually soften various discrete aspects. For instance, production rule conditions can be assigned numerical values, productions can have strengths, and interactions between memory items can be manually introduced (Anderson, 1983).\\n\\nThe sub-symbolic paradigm offers another solution. By adopting a continuous framework at the sub-conceptual level, all discrete features of (24) are effectively bypassed. When analyzed at a higher, conceptual level, aspects of discreteness naturally and inevitably emerge without the need for explicit mechanisms. These \\'hard\\' aspects are intrinsically embedded within a fundamentally \\'soft\\' system. This approach resolves the dilemma of accounting for both hard and soft aspects of cognition by transitioning from a lower to a higher level of analysis, allowing emergent properties to differ from fundamental ones. This concept will be further explored in the remainder of the chapter, grounded in the fundamental continuity of sub-symbolic computation (for further discussion, see Smolensky, 1987b).\\n\\nIt might seem that the continuous nature of sub-symbolic systems is contradicted by models in the connectionist literature that align with the sub-symbolic paradigm but lack continuous state spaces or dynamics. For example, models with binary units that change discretely with a discrete clock (e.g., the Boltzmann machine: Hinton and Sejnowski 1983a; Ackley et al., 1985; harmony theory: Smolensky, 1983, 1986a). I argue that these models should be seen as discrete simulations of an underlying continuous model, considering first the discretization of time and then the discretization of unit values.\\n\\nDynamical systems evolving in continuous time are typically simulated on digital computers by discretizing time. Since sub-symbolic models are often simulated on digital computers, it is unsurprising that they too are simulated by discretizing time. The dynamics of these models are more easily understood by cognitive scientists when discrete-time approximations are used instead of the differential equations of the underlying continuous system.\\n\\nWhen sub-symbolic models use binary-valued units, these values should be viewed not as symbols like $T$ and NIL for conditional branching, but as numbers like 1 and 0 for numerical operations (e.g., multiplication by weights, summation, exponentiation). These models are designed to be well-defined for continuous unit values, with discrete values serving as a convenient simplification.\\n\\nHistorically, when theoretical conditions allowing discrete approximations changed, models reverted to continuous values. In the harmony/energy optima model, when stochastic search was replaced by a smooth deterministic one (Rumelhart et al. 1986c), units became continuous.\\n\\nA significant historical example is the shift from discrete to continuous units, which revolutionized sub-symbolic learning theory. In \"Perceptrons,\" Minsky and Papert (1969) used discrete methods compatible with binary units, limiting their analysis to simple networks. By replacing the discrete threshold function of perceptrons with a smooth, differentiable curve, Rumelhart et al. (1986a) applied continuous analytic methods to more complex networks, significantly advancing sub-symbolic learning.\\n\\nAnother example of the power of continuous sub-symbolic computation is in generating sequences. Traditionally, this task involved making a connectionist system jump discretely between states to produce a sequence of actions $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\\\cdots$. This approach reduces the system to a finite state machine, offering little new to sequential behavior analysis. Jordan (1986) demonstrated how a sub-symbolic approach naturally produces co-articulation effects, where the execution of actions is influenced by future actions. These effects arise naturally from implementing serial behavior in a fundamentally parallel machine. Jordan\\'s method views the connectionist system as evolving continuously in time, generating a continuous trajectory through state space that meets boundary conditions, such as being in regions corresponding to actions $\\\\mathrm{A}_{1}, A_{2}, \\\\cdots$ at discrete times $1,2, \\\\cdots$.\\n\\nThe final point is foundational. The theory of discrete computation is well understood. If a new theory of computation is implicit in the sub-symbolic approach, it likely results from a fundamentally different, continuous formulation. To maximize the potential for new computational insights from the sub-symbolic paradigm, it is hypothesized that sub-symbolic computation is fundamentally continuous.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the discrete/continuous distinction cannot be fully understood by examining simulations alone. Discrete and continuous machines can simulate each other. The claim here is that the most analytically powerful descriptions of sub-symbolic models are continuous, whereas symbolic models are not.\\n\\nThis distinction is significant because it implies that many concepts used to understand cognition in the sub-symbolic paradigm derive from continuous mathematics, while those in the symbolic paradigm come primarily from discrete mathematics. Concepts from physics and dynamical systems theory are as likely to be important as those from digital computation theory. Analog computers, both electronic and optical, provide natural implementation media for sub-symbolic systems (Anderson, 1986; Cohen, 1986).',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{8.2 Sub-symbolic Computation}\\n\\nA key example of the contrast between continuous and discrete mathematics, which differentiates sub-symbolic from symbolic computation, is found in the process of inference. One can naturally interpret the knowledge embedded in connections by considering each connection as a soft constraint. A positive (excitatory) connection from unit $a$ to unit $b$ suggests a soft constraint indicating that if $a$ is active, then $b$ should also be active. Conversely, a negative (inhibitory) connection implies the opposite constraint. The numerical value of a connection reflects the strength of this constraint.\\n\\nExpressing knowledge through soft constraints rather than rigid rules has significant implications. Hard constraints have individual consequences; they are rules that can be applied independently and sequentially, with each rule operating without regard to others. In contrast, soft constraints do not have individual implications; any single constraint can be overridden by others. It is only the collective set of soft constraints that holds any implications. Inference, therefore, must be a cooperative process, akin to the parallel relaxation processes typically observed in sub-symbolic systems. Moreover, introducing additional soft constraints can invalidate previously valid conclusions, highlighting that sub-symbolic inference is inherently nonmonotonic.\\n\\nOne approach to formalizing soft-constraint satisfaction is through statistical inference. In certain sub-symbolic systems, soft constraints can be identified as statistical parameters, and the procedures for passing activation can be seen as statistical-inference processes (Hinton and Sejnowski, 1983b; Geman and Geman, 1984; Pearl, 1985; Shastri, 1985; Smolensky, 1986a). This identification is often complex and nuanced: unlike classical 'spreading activation' models and many local connectionist models, the strength of the connection between two units is not solely determined by the correlation between their activities (or their 'degree of association'). To implement sub-symbolic statistical inference, the appropriate connection strength between two units typically depends on all other connection strengths. The sub-symbolic learning procedures that resolve this interdependence through simple, strictly local computations and ultimately assign the correct strength to each connection are undertaking a non-trivial task.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n1. Knowledge in sub-symbolic computation is represented as a large set of soft constraints.\\n2. Inference with soft constraints is fundamentally a parallel process.\\n3. Inference with soft constraints is inherently nonmonotonic.\\n4. Certain sub-symbolic systems can be characterized as employing statistical inference.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{9.1 The Best Fit Principle}\\n\\nThe concept that each connection acts as a soft constraint can be articulated at a higher level:\\n\\n(26) The Best Fit Principle: Given an input, a sub-symbolic system generates a set of inferences that collectively provide the best fit to the input, as defined by the statistical knowledge embedded in the system's connections.\\n\\nIn its broad form, this principle can be seen as a guiding aim for sub-symbolic systems. The goal of harmony theory (Smolensky, 1983, 1984a, b; 1986a, c; Riley and Smolensky, 1984) was to give this principle a formal representation within a class of connectionist dynamical systems.\\n\\nTo make the Best Fit Principle precise, it is essential to clearly define 'inferences,' 'best fit,' and 'statistical knowledge stored in the system's connections.' Harmony theory addresses this by focusing on the harmony function $H$, which evaluates the goodness of fit for any possible set of inferences relative to the soft constraints encoded in the connection strengths. The set of inferences that maximizes $H$, or achieves the highest harmony, is considered the best set of inferences for a well-defined statistical problem.\\n\\nHarmony theory provides three key contributions. It offers a mathematically precise characterization of the prediction-from-examples goal as a statistical inference problem. It explains how this prediction goal can be accomplished using a network with a specific configuration of connections. Additionally, it outlines a method by which the network can learn the appropriate connections through experience, thereby fulfilling the prediction-from-examples objective.\\n\\nThe units in harmony networks are stochastic, meaning the differential equations defining the system incorporate randomness. A system parameter known as the computational temperature controls the degree of randomness in the units' behavior, decreasing to zero as computation progresses. This process is akin to simulated annealing, similar to the Boltzmann machine (Ackley et al., 1985; Hinton and Sejnowski, 1983a, b, 1986). For more on the relationship between harmony theory and the Boltzmann machine, see Rumelhart et al. 1986b, p. 148, and Smolensky, 1986a.\",\n"," '### 9.2 Productions, Sequential Processing, and Logical Inference\\n\\nRiley and Smolensky (1984) and Smolensky (1986a, c) introduced a simple harmony model to explain expert intuition in qualitative physics. This model addresses questions like, \"What happens to the voltages in this circuit if I increase this resistor?\" The model\\'s expertise is inherent and not a result of learning. This connectionist problem-solving system highlights the relationship between sub-conceptual and conceptual-level descriptions of sub-symbolic computation.\\n\\nIn essence, the model functions as follows: The circuit\\'s state is represented as a vector of activity across a network of units, referred to as circuit state feature units, or simply \\'feature units.\\' A segment of this activity pattern indicates whether the circuit\\'s current has increased, decreased, or remained constant, while other segments show changes in voltage drops, among other things. Some of these sub-patterns are predetermined by the problem\\'s conditions, while the rest form the solution computed by the network. Another set of network units, called knowledge atoms, corresponds to sub-patterns of activity over feature units. These sub-patterns, encoded by knowledge atoms, represent possible circuit states allowed by the laws of circuit physics. For instance, the system\\'s understanding of Ohm\\'s Law is distributed across numerous knowledge atoms, each encoding legal feature combinations for current, voltage, and resistance. The network\\'s connections determine which feature sub-pattern corresponds to a given knowledge atom. A sub-pattern linked to knowledge atom α includes a positive (or negative) value for a feature f if there is a positive (or negative) connection between unit α and unit f; if there is no connection, f is not included in α\\'s sub-pattern. All connections are bidirectional, allowing activity to propagate between feature units and knowledge atoms. These connections encode soft constraints, suggesting that \"if sub-pattern α is present, then feature f should be positive (or negative), and vice versa.\"\\n\\nDuring the computation of an answer, the network units update their values hundreds of times, each update representing a micro-decision. As the network converges to a solution, macro-decisions emerge, each representing a commitment of part of the network to a portion of the solution. These macro-decisions resemble the firing of production rules and occur in a sequence similar to a symbolic forward-chaining inference system. The system\\'s order can be measured, revealing a qualitative shift from disorder to order when the first micro-decisions are made.\\n\\nAccording to harmony theory, when given a well-posed problem and unlimited relaxation time, the system will always provide the correct answer. Under this idealization, the system\\'s competence is defined by hard constraints, such as Ohm\\'s Law, Kirchhoff\\'s Law, and the laws of simple circuits, as if these laws were embedded within the model. However, like all sub-symbolic systems, the system\\'s performance is achieved by satisfying numerous soft constraints. This means that if conditions deviate from the ideal, the illusion of hard constraints quickly fades. The system can violate Ohm\\'s Law if necessary, but it will adhere to it if possible. Outside the idealized domain of well-posed problems and unlimited processing time, the system performs sensibly and is not as brittle as symbolic inference systems. When faced with an ill-posed problem, the system satisfies as many constraints as possible. If given inconsistent information, it does not collapse and deduce anything indiscriminately. If provided with insufficient information, it does not stagnate. With limited processing time, performance degrades gracefully. These features naturally emerge from performing inference in a sub-symbolic system, without additional mechanisms to handle deviations from ideal conditions.\\n\\nReturning to a physics-level analogy from section 5, we have a \\'quantum\\' system that appears \\'Newtonian\\' under the right conditions. At the micro-level, the system satisfies soft constraints in parallel, while at the macro-level, under appropriate circumstances, it satisfies hard constraints serially. However, outside the Newtonian domain, it is evident that the system has always been quantum.\\n\\nThis model exemplifies the competence/performance distinction in the sub-symbolic paradigm. It is an inference system (albeit limited) whose performance is characterized at the sub-conceptual level by standard sub-symbolic computation: the parallel satisfaction of multiple soft constraints. The system is fundamentally soft, yet its behavior can be analyzed at a higher level. Under suitable conditions (well-posed problems) and processing idealizations (unlimited computation time), the system\\'s competence can be described using different computational terms: the hard rules of the circuit domain. While the competence theory is crucial, the performance theory employs radically different computational mechanisms.\\n\\nThe relationship between the competence and performance theories for this model can be understood as follows: The system\\'s behavior is determined by its harmony function, which defines a landscape of harmony values over the network states. In this landscape, peaks represent global maxima where harmony is maximized, corresponding to network states that satisfy all physics laws. The competence theory describes the structure of these global harmony maxima. However, these maxima are a small subset of a broader harmony landscape, and the network\\'s performance involves a stochastic search for these peaks. The problem\\'s conditions restrict the search to the space consistent with those conditions. If the problem is well-posed, exactly one global harmony peak will be accessible, and given unlimited search time, the system will reach this peak, aligning performance with competence theory. As search time decreases, the likelihood of not reaching the correct harmony peak increases. If insufficient information is provided, multiple global harmony peaks become accessible, and the system converges to one of them. If inconsistent information is given, no global harmony peaks are accessible, but the network will converge toward the highest available peaks, representing states that satisfy as many circuit laws as possible.\\n\\nSub-symbolic computation involves the evolution of a dynamical system. The input is a set of constraints on accessible states (or the system\\'s initial state). The system evolves over time according to its differential equations, typically approaching an equilibrium state—the output. The function relating input to output is the competence theory, which is crucial to characterize. However, it differs from the performance theory, which is the differential equation governing the system\\'s evolution. Relating the performance and competence of cognitive systems aligns with a key task of dynamical systems theory: connecting a system\\'s local description (differential equations) to its global (asymptotic) behavior.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{9.3 Conceptual-Level Spreading Activation}\\n\\nIn Section 7.2, it was noted that the states of a sub-symbolic model can be approximately analyzed as superpositions of vectors with distinct conceptual-level semantics. This allows for the approximate analysis of connectionist dynamical systems at the conceptual level using the mathematics of superposition. If a connectionist system is purely linear—meaning the activity of each unit is precisely a weighted sum of the activities of the units providing input—it can be easily demonstrated that the higher-level description follows formal laws similar to those at the lower level. In such cases, computations at both the sub-conceptual and conceptual levels are isomorphic. However, linear connectionist systems have limited computational power, and most interesting connectionist systems are non-linear. Despite this, many are quasilinear: a unit's value is computed by taking the weighted sum of its inputs and passing it through a non-linear function, such as a threshold or sigmoid. In quasilinear systems, each unit combines its inputs linearly, even though the effect of this combination on the unit's activity is nonlinear. Furthermore, the problem-specific knowledge in these systems resides in the combination weights, which are the linear components of the dynamical equations. In learning systems, it is generally these linear weights that adapt. Therefore, even though the higher level is not isomorphic to the lower level in non-linear systems, there are aspects in which the higher level approximately follows formal laws similar to those at the lower level (for details, see Smolensky, 1986b).\\n\\nThe conclusion here differs from the preceding section, where we observed how higher-level characterizations of certain sub-symbolic systems approximate productions, serial processing, and logical inference. Now, we see that there are also aspects in which the laws describing cognition at the conceptual level are activation-passing laws, similar to those at the sub-conceptual level, but operating between units with individual conceptual semantics. These semantic-level descriptions of mental processing, which include local connectionist models (see note 3), have been of considerable value in cognitive science. We can now understand how these 'spreading activation' accounts of mental processing fit into the sub-symbolic paradigm.\",\n"," '### 9.4 Schemata\\n\\nThe final conceptual-level notion I will discuss is that of the schema, a concept that dates back to Kant (1787/1963) as a description of mental concepts and categories. In artificial intelligence, schemata often appear as frames, scripts, or similar structures. They serve as prepackaged bundles of information that facilitate inference in typical situations (see also Arbib, 1987).\\n\\nI will briefly summarize work on schemata in connectionist systems as reported by Rumelhart et al. (1986c) (see also Feldman, 1981; Smolensky, 1986a, c). This research focused on schemata for rooms. Participants were asked to describe imagined rooms using a set of 40 features, such as has-ceiling, has-window, contains-toilet, and so on. Statistical analyses of these data were used to construct a network with nodes representing each feature and connections derived from the statistical data.\\n\\nThe resulting network can perform inferences similar to those made by symbolic systems with schemata for various room types. For example, if the network is informed that a room contains a ceiling and an oven, it can infer what else might be present. The system eventually reaches a stable state, and among the inferences are: the room contains a coffee cup but no fireplace, a coffee pot but no computer.\\n\\nThe inference process in this system involves greedily maximizing harmony. (See the multiple book review of Sperber and Wilson\\'s \"Relevance\" in Behavioral and Brain Sciences 10(4).) To describe the system\\'s inference at a higher level, we can examine the global states in terms of their harmony values. How internally consistent are the various states in the space? It\\'s a 40-dimensional state space, but various 2-dimensional sub-spaces can be selected, and the harmony values can be graphically displayed. The harmony landscape has various peaks; examining the features of the state corresponding to one of these peaks reveals a prototypical bathroom, while others correspond to a prototypical office, and so on for all the room types described by participants. There are no specific units for bathrooms or offices in this system—only lower-level descriptors. The prototypical bathroom is a pattern of activation, and the system\\'s recognition of its prototypicality is reflected in the harmony peak for that pattern. It is a consistent, \\'harmonious\\' combination of features, superior to neighboring points, such as one representing a bathroom without a bathtub, which has distinctly lower harmony.\\n\\nDuring inference, this system ascends directly on the harmony landscape. When the system state is near the harmony peak representing the prototypical bathroom, its inferences are guided by the shape of the harmony landscape. This shape acts like a schema that governs inferences about bathrooms. (In fact, harmony theory was developed to provide a connectionist formalization of the schema concept; see Smolensky, 1984b, 1986a, c.) Examining the harmony landscape closely, we find that the terrain around the \\'bathroom\\' peak exhibits many properties of a bathroom schema: variables and constants, default values, schemata embedded within schemata, and even cross-variable dependencies, which are challenging to incorporate into symbolic formalizations of schemata. The system behaves as though it possesses schemata for bathrooms, offices, and so forth, even though they do not exist at the fundamental level. These schemata are strictly properties of a higher-level description. They are informal, approximate descriptions—one might even say metaphorical—of an inference process too subtle for precise high-level descriptions. Although these schemata may not form the basis of a formal model, they are nonetheless useful descriptions that help us understand a complex inference system.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{1.1 Levels of Explanation}\\n\\nIn modern theories of the mind, two primary schools of thought exist: the 'representationalist' and the 'eliminativist' traditions. Representationalists argue that incorporating representational (or 'intentional' or 'semantic') states is crucial for understanding cognition. They believe that the mind contains states that encode information about the world. On the other hand, eliminativists contend that psychological theories can do without semantic notions like representation. They propose that the appropriate language for psychological theories should be neurological, behavioral, or syntactic, rather than one that describes mental states in terms of representation. For examples of eliminativism, see P.S. Churchland (1986) for a neurological perspective, Watson (1930) for a behavioral approach, and Stich (1983) for a syntactic viewpoint.\\n\\nConnectionists align with the representationalist perspective. As Rumelhart and McClelland (1986b, p. 121) state, Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models are 'explicitly concerned with the problem of internal representation.' In connectionist models, specifying what a network's states represent is essential. For instance, consider the well-known connectionist explanation of the Necker cube's bi-stability (Feldman and Ballard, 1982): 'Simple units representing the visual features of the two alternatives are arranged in competing coalitions, with inhibitory links between rival features and positive links within each coalition. The result is a network that has two dominant stable states' (see figure 3.1). In such models, the commitment to mental representation is clear: a node's label expresses the representational content of the state when the node is activated, with nodes corresponding to monadic and relational properties of the reversible cube when viewed differently.\\n\\nConnectionists sometimes seem to waver between representationalism and the idea that the 'cognitive level' can be replaced by a more precise, biologically motivated theory. The connectionist literature often discusses 'sub-symbolic' processes, which are presumably non-representational. However, this is misleading: connectionist modeling is consistently representationalist in practice, and representationalism is generally supported by theorists who also appreciate the notion of cognition 'emerging from the sub-symbolic.' Rumelhart and McClelland (1986b, p. 121) emphasize that PDP models are 'strongly committed to the study of representation and process.' Similarly, Smolensky (chapter 2) suggests that connectionism articulates regularities at the 'sub-symbolic level' of analysis, where sub-symbolic states have a semantics distinct from the 'conceptual level.' According to Smolensky (chapter 2, p. 34), the semantic difference between symbolic and sub-symbolic theories is that 'entities typically represented in the symbolic paradigm by [single] symbols are typically represented in the sub-symbolic paradigm by a large number of sub-symbols.' Both conceptual and sub-symbolic levels postulate representational states, but sub-symbolic theories offer a more granular approach.\\n\\nWe emphasize the representationalist nature of connectionist theorizing because much of the methodological discourse in connectionism revolves around the question, 'What level of explanation is appropriate for theories of cognitive architecture?' (see, for example, the exchange between Broadbent, 1985, and Rumelhart and McClelland, 1985). As we will see, one's stance on the levels question heavily depends on whether one believes in representational states.\\n\\nIt is evident that the world has a causal structure at various levels of analysis, with entities at the lowest levels being generally small and those at the highest levels being generally large. Thus, there are scientific narratives about quarks, atoms, molecules, rocks, rivers, and galaxies. The scientific explanation of the causal structure at any given level may differ significantly from the explanation at the next level up or down. The methodological implication for psychology is that if you want to debate cognitive architecture, you must specify the level of analysis in question.\\n\\nFor non-representationalists, this is challenging because it is not clear what defines a phenomenon as cognitive. However, specifying the relevant level of analysis for theories of cognitive architecture is straightforward for both classicists and connectionists. Since both are representationalists, any level at which system states encode world properties is considered a cognitive level; no other levels qualify. Representations of 'the world' include representations of symbols; for example, the concept WORD is a cognitive-level construct because it represents something, namely words. Consequently, discussions of cognitive architecture focus on the architecture of representational states and processes. In other words, the cognitive system's architecture consists of the basic operations, resources, functions, principles, etc. (generally the properties described in a 'user's manual' for that architecture if it were available on a computer), whose domain and range are the organism's representational states.\\n\\nTherefore, to validate the Connectionist theory as a theory of cognitive architecture, one must demonstrate that the processes operating on an organism's representational states are those specified by a connectionist architecture. From a cognitive psychologist's perspective, it is insufficient to show that an organism's non-representational (e.g., neurological, molecular, or quantum mechanical) states form a connectionist network, as this leaves open the question of whether the mind is such a network at the psychological level. It is entirely possible for non-representational neurological states to be interconnected as described by connectionist models, while the representational states themselves are not. This is because it is possible to implement a connectionist cognitive architecture in a network of causally interacting non-representational elements, just as it is possible to implement a classical cognitive architecture in such a network. The question of whether connectionist networks should be treated as models at some level of implementation is debatable and will be discussed in detail in section 4.\\n\\nIt is crucial to be clear about this matter of levels to avoid trivializing the issues surrounding cognitive architecture. Consider, for example, the following remark by Rumelhart:\\n\\nFor some years now, I have believed that there must be a unified account in which both rule-governed and exceptional cases are addressed by a single underlying process—a process that produces rule-like and rule-exception behavior through the application of a single process. In this process, both rule-like and non-rule-like behavior result from the interaction of numerous 'sub-symbolic' processes. (Rumelhart, 1984, p. 60)\\n\\nRumelhart clearly views this idea as contentious, suggesting that connectionist claims challenge Classical theories.\\n\\nHowever, this is not the case. Of course, 'sub-symbolic' interactions implement both rule-like and rule-violating behavior; for example, quantum mechanical processes do. Classical theorists do not deny this; indeed, no materialist does. Nor do Classical theorists deny that rule-following and rule-violating behaviors are implemented by the same neurological machinery. For Classical theorists, neurons implement all cognitive processes in the same way: by supporting the basic operations required for symbol-processing.\\n\\nAn interesting and contentious claim would be that there is no distinction between rule-following and rule-violating mentation at the cognitive, representational, or symbolic level; specifically, that rule-following behavior is not mediated by the representation of explicit rules. We will explore this idea in section 4, where we will argue that it does not divide classical from connectionist architecture; classical models allow for a principled distinction between the etiologies of explicitly rule-governed mental processes and those that are not, but they do not require one.\\n\\nIn summary, the debate between classical and connectionist architecture is not about the explicitness of rules; as we will see, classical architecture is not inherently committed to the idea that explicit rules mediate behavior. Nor is it about the reality of representational states; both classicists and connectionists are representational realists. It is not about non-representational architecture; a connectionist neural network can implement a classical architecture at the cognitive level.\\n\\nSo, what is the disagreement between classical and connectionist architecture about?\",\n"," \"**2. The Nature of the Dispute**\\n\\nClassicists and connectionists both attribute semantic content to certain entities. Generally, connectionists assign semantic content to 'nodes'—units or aggregates of units, as typically labeled in connectionist diagrams. In contrast, classicists assign semantic content to expressions, which are the elements written on Turing machine tapes and stored at addresses in von Neumann machines. However, classical theories and connectionist theories differ in their views on the primitive relations among these content-bearing entities. Connectionist theories recognize only causal connectedness as a primitive relation among nodes; understanding how activation and inhibition flow among them reveals everything about their interrelations. Conversely, classical theories recognize not only causal relations among semantically evaluable objects but also a range of structural relations, with constituency being a prime example.\\n\\nThis fundamental difference significantly impacts how the two theories address various cognitive phenomena, which we will explore in detail. Underlying these disagreements are two key architectural differences between the theories:\\n\\n1. **Combinatorial Syntax and Semantics for Mental Representations:** Classical theories, unlike connectionist theories, propose a 'language of thought' (see Fodor, 1976). They view mental representations as having a combinatorial syntax and semantics, characterized by:\\n   - A distinction between structurally atomic and structurally molecular representations.\\n   - Structurally molecular representations having syntactic constituents that are either structurally molecular or atomic.\\n   - The semantic content of a molecular representation being a function of the semantic contents of its syntactic parts and its constituent structure.\\n   \\n   For convenience, we will sometimes refer to classical theories as being committed to 'complex' mental representations or 'symbol structures'.\\n\\n2. **Structure Sensitivity of Processes:** In classical models, the principles governing the transformation of mental states or the selection of corresponding outputs are defined over the structural properties of mental representations. Because classical mental representations have a combinatorial structure, classical mental operations can apply to them based on their form. Consequently, a typical classical mental process operates on any mental representation that meets a given structural description, transforming it into another representation that satisfies a different structural description. For instance, in a model of inference, an operation might apply to any representation of the form \\\\(P \\\\mathcal{G} Q\\\\) and transform it into a representation of the form \\\\(P\\\\). This operation can apply equally to representations that vary widely in structural complexity, such as transforming an expression like \\\\((\\\\operatorname{AvBvC}) \\\\& (DvEvF)\\\\) into \\\\((\\\\operatorname{AvBvC})\\\\).\\n\\nWe consider (1) and (2) as defining claims of classical models, taking them literally; they constrain the physical realizations of symbol structures. In particular, symbol structures in a classical model are assumed to correspond to real physical structures in the brain, with the combinatorial structure of a representation having a counterpart in structural relations among physical properties of the brain. For example, the 'part of' relation between a simple symbol and a more complex one is assumed to correspond to some physical relation among brain states. This is why Newell (1980) refers to computational systems like brains and classical computers as 'physical symbol systems'.\\n\\nThis emphasis is crucial because the classical theory is committed not only to the existence of a system of physically instantiated symbols but also to the claim that the physical properties onto which the structure of the symbols is mapped are the very properties causing the system's behavior. In other words, the physical counterparts of the symbols and their structural properties drive the system's behavior. A system with symbolic expressions, but whose operation does not depend on the structure of these expressions, does not qualify as a classical machine since it fails to meet condition (2). In this respect, a classical model differs significantly from one where behavior is caused by mechanisms, such as energy minimization, that are not responsive to the physical encoding of representation structures.\\n\\nFrom now on, when we refer to 'classical' models, we mean any model with complex mental representations, as characterized in (1), and structure-sensitive mental processes, as characterized in (2). Our account of classical architecture is neutral regarding issues such as the presence of a separate executive. For example, classical machines can have an 'object-oriented' architecture, like the computer language Smalltalk, or a 'message passing' architecture, like Hewett's (1977) Actors, as long as the objects or messages have a combinatorial structure causally implicated in processing. Classical architecture is also neutral on whether operations on symbols occur one at a time or simultaneously.\\n\\nHere is the plan for what follows. In the rest of this section, we will outline the connectionist proposal for a computational architecture that eliminates complex mental representations and structure-sensitive operations. Although our purpose here is merely expository, describing exactly what connectionists are committed to requires substantial reconstruction of their remarks and practices. Given the diversity of perspectives within the connectionist community, we anticipate that some connectionists may not fully endorse the program when presented in what we consider its bare essentials. Following this general expository (or reconstructive) discussion, section 3 provides a series of arguments favoring the classical story. The remainder of the chapter examines why connectionism appeals to many and offers further general comments on the relationship between the classical and connectionist approaches.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{2.1 Complex Mental Representations}\\n\\nLet's begin by examining a simple scenario involving two types of machines: one classical and one connectionist. The connectionist machine operates through a network of labeled nodes, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. The paths between these nodes represent the routes along which activation can spread, indicating how the excitation of one node affects the excitation levels of others. For instance, drawing an inference from A & B to A corresponds to the excitation of node 2 being triggered by the excitation of node 1. Alternatively, if the system is in a state where node 1 is excited, it will eventually stabilize into a state where node 2 is excited (see note 7).\\n\\nNow, consider a classical machine. This machine uses a tape to write expressions. Among the expressions that can appear on this tape are: 'A', 'B', '$A \\\\& B$', 'C', 'D', 'C\\\\&D', 'A\\\\&C\\\\&D', and so on. The machine's causal structure is such that whenever a token of the form $P \\\\& Q$ appears on the tape, it writes a token of the form P. Thus, an inference from $A \\\\& B$ to $A$ corresponds to a token of type '$A \\\\& B$' on the tape causing a token of type 'A'.\\n\\nSo, what distinguishes the architectures of these machines? In the classical machine, the objects to which the content $A \\\\& B$ is ascribed (i.e., tokens of the expression '$A \\\\& B$') literally contain, as proper parts, objects to which the content A is ascribed (i.e., tokens of the expression 'A'). Moreover, the semantics (e.g., the satisfaction conditions) of the expression '$A \\\\& B$' is determined uniformly by the semantics of its constituents. In contrast, in the connectionist machine, none of this holds true; the object to which the content $A \\\\& B$ is ascribed (i.e., node 1) is causally connected to the object to which the content A is ascribed (i.e., node 2), but there is no structural (e.g., part/whole) relationship between them. In summary, classical systems, unlike connectionist systems, typically utilize arrays of symbols, some of which are atomic (e.g., expressions like 'A'), while many others have additional symbols as syntactic and semantic parts (e.g., expressions like 'A\\\\&B').\\n\\nThis distinction between classical and connectionist architectures can be easily overlooked when reading connectionist literature or examining a connectionist model. There are at least four reasons why one might be led to overlook this difference:\\n\\n1. By failing to understand the difference between what arrays of symbols do in classical machines and what node labels do in connectionist machines.\\n2. By confusing the question of whether the nodes in connectionist networks have constituent structure with the question of whether they are neurologically distributed.\\n3. By failing to distinguish between a representation having semantic and syntactic constituents and a concept being encoded in terms of microfeatures.\\n4. By assuming that since representations of connectionist networks have a graph structure, it follows that the nodes in the networks have a corresponding constituent structure.\\n\\nWe will now need a rather lengthy digression to clarify these misunderstandings.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{2.1.1 The Role of Labels in Connectionist Theories}\\n\\nWhen developing a connectionist model, intentional content is assigned to machine states, and expressions from a particular language are used to convey this assignment. For instance, nodes may be labeled to indicate their representational content. These labels often possess a combinatorial syntax and semantics, making them resemble Classical mental representations. However, it's crucial to note that this does not imply that the nodes themselves have a combinatorial syntax and semantics. For example, 'A & B' can be represented on the tape of a classical machine and can also appear as a label in a connectionist machine, as shown in figure 3.2. The expression 'A & B' is syntactically and semantically complex, containing 'A' as one of its syntactic constituents, and its semantics are derived from the semantics of 'A'. However, it is not intended to suggest that node 1 itself has constituents; unlike its label, the node has no semantically interpreted parts.\\n\\nIt is essential to understand the distinction between connectionist labels and the symbols used in Classical computations. The key difference is that, strictly speaking, labels do not influence the operation of a connectionist machine. Specifically, the machine's operation is unaffected by the syntactic and semantic relationships among the expressions used as labels. In other words, node labels in a connectionist machine are not part of the machine's causal structure. Therefore, the machine depicted in figure 3.2 will continue to make the same state transitions regardless of the labels assigned to the nodes. In contrast, the state transitions of classical machines are causally determined by the structure, including the constituent structure, of the symbol arrays they transform. Changing the symbols results in different system behavior. In fact, since a classical machine's behavior is sensitive to the syntax of the representations it processes, even swapping synonymous (semantically equivalent) representations can alter the computation's course. Thus, while both connectionist labels and classicist data structures constitute languages, only the latter serves as a medium of computation.\",\n"," '\\\\subsection*{2.1.2 Connectionist Networks and Graph Structures}\\n\\nThe second reason the lack of syntactic and semantic structure in connectionist representations has often been overlooked is that connectionist networks resemble general graphs. It is entirely feasible to use graphs to describe the internal structure of complex symbols. Linguists, for instance, employ \\'trees\\' to illustrate the constituent structure of sentences. Similarly, one could envision a graph notation that represents the internal structure of mental representations using arcs and labeled nodes. For example, the syntax of the mental representation corresponding to the thought \"John loves the girl\" might be expressed as: John $\\\\rightarrow$ loves $\\\\rightarrow$ the girl.\\n\\nIn this interpretation, the graph would serve as the structural description of a mental representation with the content \"John loves the girl,\" and its constituents would include: a mental representation referring to John, a mental representation referring to the girl, and a mental representation expressing the two-place relation denoted by \\' $\\\\rightarrow$ loves $\\\\rightarrow$ \\'.\\n\\nHowever, while graphs can be interpreted as specifying the logical syntax of a complex mental representation, this interpretation is not suitable for graphs of connectionist networks. Connectionist graphs do not describe the structure of mental representations; rather, they specify causal relationships. In a connectionist context, a graph of the form $\\\\mathrm{X} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{Y}$ simply means that the state of node $X$ causally affects the state of node $Y$. The graph does not imply that $X$ is a constituent of $Y$ or that $X$ is grammatically related to $Y$, as these types of relationships are generally not defined for the mental representations recognized by connectionists.\\n\\nIn other words, the links in connectionist diagrams are not generalized pointers that can assume different functional significances through an independent interpreter. Instead, they are confined to meanings such as \\'sends activation to.\\' The intended interpretation of these links as causal connections is intrinsic to the theory. Ignoring this point may lead one to mistakenly believe that connectionism offers a more complex notion of mental representation than it actually does.',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{2.2 Structure-Sensitive Operations}\\n\\nBoth classicists and connectionists offer theories about mental processes, but their approaches differ significantly. The Classical theory emphasizes the logico-syntactic form of mental representations to define the scope and domain of mental operations. This concept is not available to orthodox connectionists, as it assumes the existence of non-atomic mental representations.\\n\\nThe Classical approach to mental processes is based on two key ideas, each reflecting an aspect of the Classical theory of computation. Together, these ideas explain why the Classical view posits at least three distinct levels of organization in computational systems: a physical level, a semantic (or \\'knowledge\\') level, and a syntactic level.\\n\\nThe first idea is that languages can be constructed such that certain syntactic features of formulas systematically correspond to certain semantic features. Intuitively, this means that in such languages, the syntax of a formula encodes its meaning, particularly those aspects that determine its role in inference. All artificial languages used in logic possess this property, and English does to some extent. Classicists argue that this is a crucial property of the Language of Thought.\\n\\nA simple example illustrating how a language can use syntactic structure to encode inferential roles and relationships among meanings is as follows. Consider the relationship between these two sentences:\\n1. John went to the store and Mary went to the store.\\n2. Mary went to the store.\\n\\nFrom a semantic perspective, sentence (1) entails sentence (2), meaning inferences from (1) to (2) preserve truth. Syntactically, sentence (2) is a constituent of sentence (1). These facts align through the principle that sentences with the syntactic structure \\'(S1 and S2)\\' entail their sentential constituents. This principle connects the syntax of these sentences with their inferential roles. It relies on the grammar of English; it wouldn\\'t work in a language where the formula expressing the conjunctive content \"John went to the store and Mary went to the store\" is syntactically atomic.\\n\\nAnother example involves reconstructing truth-preserving inferences such as \"if Rover bites, then something bites,\" assuming (a) the sentence \\'Rover bites\\' is of the syntactic type Fa, (b) the sentence \\'something bites\\' is of the syntactic type $\\\\exists x(\\\\mathbf{F x})$, and (c) every formula of the first type entails a corresponding formula of the second type. Here, \\'corresponding formula\\' is defined syntactically; the two formulas must differ only in that one has an existentially bound variable where the other has a constant. Again, this illustrates the blending of syntactical and semantical notions: the rule of existential generalization applies to formulas based on their syntactic form. The property preserved under this rule is semantical: the transformation it performs is truth-preserving.\\n\\nThere are more complex examples, and the entire branch of logic known as proof theory explores them. Classical cognitive science can be seen as an extended attempt to apply proof theory methods to modeling thought and other mental processes involving inferences, such as learning and perception. Classical theory construction is based on the hope that syntactic analogues can be created for non-demonstrative inferences (or informal, commonsense reasoning) in a manner similar to how proof theory provides syntactic analogues for validity.\\n\\nThe second main idea in the Classical treatment of mental processes is the possibility of creating machines that transform symbols and whose operations are sensitive to the syntactic structure of those symbols. This is the Classical conception of a computer, common to architectures derived from Turing and von Neumann machines.\\n\\nThe connection between these two \\'main ideas\\' is perhaps obvious. If syntactic relations can parallel semantic relations, and if a mechanism can operate on formulas based on their syntax, it may be possible to construct a syntactically driven machine whose state transitions meet semantical criteria of coherence. Such a machine would be ideal for modeling the semantical coherence of thought, and the idea that the brain functions as such a machine is the foundational hypothesis of Classical cognitive science.\\n\\nThis concludes the Classical perspective on mental processes. The Connectionist perspective, however, is quite different. Connectionists avoid postulating mental representations with combinatorial syntactic/semantic structures, thus precluding mental processes that operate on such representations. Connectionist models feature two types of operations, depending on whether the process in question is learning or reasoning.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection{2.2.1 Learning}\\n\\nIn a connectionist model designed for learning, processes are in place to adjust the weights of connections among its units based on the nature of its training. Typically, in a connectionist system, such as a 'Boltzmann machine,' these weights are modified until the system's behavior reflects the statistical properties of its inputs. Ultimately, the stochastic relationships among machine states mirror the stochastic relationships among the environmental events they represent.\\n\\nThis concept echoes the traditional associationist principle that the strength of association between 'ideas' is influenced by the frequency of their pairing 'in experience.' Similarly, the learning theory principle suggests that the strength of a stimulus-response connection is determined by the frequency with which the response is rewarded in the presence of the stimulus. While connectionists, like other associationists, are committed to learning processes that model the statistical properties of inputs and outputs, they have enhanced the simple mechanisms based on co-occurrence statistics, which were characteristic of traditional associationism, with various technical advancements. This is why it is referred to as 'new connectionism.' For instance, some earlier limitations of associative mechanisms are addressed by incorporating 'hidden' units (or aggregates) within the network. These units are not directly connected to the environment and serve to detect statistical patterns in the activity of the 'visible' units, potentially identifying patterns that are more abstract or 'global' than those detectable by traditional perceptrons.\\n\\nIn summary, sophisticated versions of associative principles for weight-setting are available in the connectionist literature. The key point of interest is what all these principles share with each other and with older forms of associationism: they are all frequency-sensitive. To revisit the earlier example: if a connectionist learning machine reaches a state where it is inclined to infer A from A&B (i.e., when the 'A & B' node is activated, it tends to settle into a state where the 'A' node is activated), this convergence is typically driven by the statistical properties of the machine's training experience. This could be due to the correlation between the firing of the 'A & B' node and the 'A' node or correlations of both with some feedback signal. Like traditional associationism, connectionism views learning as fundamentally a form of statistical modeling.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection{2.2.2 Reasoning}\\n\\nAssociation plays a crucial role in modifying the structure of a network over time as it undergoes training. Connectionist models incorporate various 'relaxation' processes that dictate the network's behavior at any given moment, specifically determining the output for a given set of inputs. In this context, a connectionist model can be viewed as a type of analog machine designed to perform a specific function. The inputs to this function include: (a) a description of the machine's connectivity (which nodes are linked to which); (b) a specification of the weights assigned to these connections; (c) a description of various unique parameters of the nodes (such as intrinsic thresholds and time since last activation); and (d) a pattern of excitation across the input nodes. The function's output is a pattern of excitation across the output nodes, with the machine selecting the output pattern most closely associated with its input.\\n\\nA significant portion of the mathematical complexity in connectionist theory has been dedicated to developing analog solutions for identifying the 'most highly associated' output for any given input. However, the specifics of these solutions are not our primary concern. What is crucial is a shared property between Connectionist theories and other forms of associationism. In traditional associationism, the likelihood of one idea triggering another depends on the strength of their association, including any 'mediating' associations. This associative strength is influenced by the degree to which the ideas have been previously correlated. However, associative strength was not assumed to be affected by the content or structure of the representations themselves. Similarly, in connectionist models, the selection of an output for a given input is determined by the properties of the connecting paths (including weights and the states of intermediate units). These weights are influenced by the statistical properties of environmental events or the relationships between environmental patterns and the network's implicit 'predictions.' However, the syntactic or semantic structure of an input's representation is not considered a factor in selecting a corresponding output, as syntactic and semantic structures are not defined for the types of representations acknowledged by connectionist models.\\n\\nIn summary, Classical and Connectionist theories differ in their views on mental representation. Classical theories, unlike Connectionist ones, assert that mental representations typically have a combinatorial constituent structure and semantics. They also differ in their views on mental processes; Classical theories argue that mental processes are sensitive to the combinatorial structure of the representations they manipulate, a view not shared by Connectionist theories.\\n\\nThese two issues form the core of the current debate on cognitive architecture. We intend to argue that connectionists are mistaken on both counts.\",\n"," '\\\\subsection*{3.1 Productivity of Thought}\\n\\nThere is a traditional argument supporting the existence of a combinatorial structure in any complex representational system, such as natural languages and the language of thought. These systems are assumed to have unbounded representational capacities under ideal conditions, meaning they can encode an infinite number of propositions. However, this limitless expressive power must be achieved through finite means. This is accomplished by treating the system of representations as a set of generated expressions. Specifically, the relationship between a representation and the proposition it expresses is often constructed recursively from the relationships between parts of the expression and parts of the proposition. This strategy is only feasible when an infinite number of expressions are non-atomic. Therefore, linguistic and mental representations must form symbol systems. Consequently, the mind cannot be a Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) system.\\n\\nWhen people reject this reasoning, it is often because they doubt that human cognitive capacities are genuinely productive. Ultimately, there can be no definitive arguments for or against idealizing productive capacities; acceptance depends on whether one believes that the inference from finite performance to finite capacity is justified or whether finite performance results from the interaction of unbounded competence with resource constraints. Traditionalists have typically supported the latter view with a combination of methodological and empirical considerations.\\n\\nFrom a methodological standpoint, assuming productivity prevents reliance on impractical solutions, such as storing all pairs that define a function, which would be unreasonable even for finite tasks with significant memory demands. The idealization to unbounded productive capacity forces theorists to distinguish between the finite specification of a method for solving a computational problem and the resources available to the system or person at any given moment.\\n\\nEmpirical arguments for productivity are often made concerning linguistic competence. Chomsky (1968) has convincingly argued that the knowledge underlying linguistic competence is generative, allowing us to generate or understand an infinite number of sentences. While no one can actually utter or understand more than a finite number of sentence tokens, several considerations suggest that one\\'s knowledge of language supports an unbounded productive capacity, similar to how knowledge of addition supports an infinite number of sums. For example, a speaker\\'s performance can often improve by relaxing time constraints, increasing motivation, or using tools like pencil and paper. These manipulations seem to affect the transient state of memory and attention rather than the speaker\\'s knowledge or representation of language. This treatment is only possible if the subject\\'s performance is determined by interactions between the knowledge base and available computational resources.\\n\\nClassical theories accommodate these considerations by assuming architectures with a functional distinction between memory and program. In systems like a Turing machine, where the tape length is not predetermined, increasing available memory does not change the machine\\'s computational structure, as more tape can be added. In contrast, in finite state automata or connectionist machines, adding memory (e.g., by adding units to a network) alters connectivity among nodes, affecting the machine\\'s computational structure. Connectionist cognitive architectures cannot support expandable memory and, therefore, cannot support productive cognitive capacities. If productivity arguments are valid, they suggest that the mind\\'s architecture cannot be connectionist. Connectionists generally acknowledge this and thus reject productivity arguments.\\n\\nThe test of a good scientific idealization is whether it leads to successful science in the long term. The productivity idealization has proven valuable, especially in linguistics and theories of reasoning. However, connectionists remain unconvinced. For instance, Rumelhart and McClelland (1986b, p. 119) argue that productive capabilities are not essential to human computation. They note that processing sentences with center-embedded structures is challenging, suggesting that the difficulty lies not in the need for flawless processing but in explaining these processes through mechanisms natural to PDP networks.\\n\\nRumelhart and McClelland\\'s remarks imply that the difficulty of center-embedded sentences challenges theories viewing linguistic capacities as productive. However, these theories attribute performance to interactions between productive competence and limited resources. Classical accounts explain why center-embeddings demand significant resources, supported by experimental evidence (e.g., Wanner and Maratsos, 1978).\\n\\nThe difficulty of parsing center-embeddings cannot be due to their recursive nature, as many recursive structures are easy to understand. For example, \"This is the dog that chased the cat that ate the rat that lived in the house that Jack built\" is transparent. The classicist\\'s argument for productive capacities in parsing relies on such transparency. While center-embedded sentences may be challenging, Rumelhart and McClelland would need to claim that no recursive structures are parseable, which is evidently false.\\n\\nRumelhart and McClelland\\'s discussion of recursion (1986b, pp. 119-20) deserves attention. They concede that PDPs can model recursive capacities indirectly by implementing classical architectures like ATNs. If human cognition exhibited recursive capacities, it would suggest classical rather than connectionist architecture at the psychological level. They argue that recursive capacities are not essential to human computation, but their argument is unconvincing.\\n\\nRumelhart and McClelland suggest that if some cognitive capacities are productive, it supports classical cognitive architecture, treating connectionism as an implementation theory. This is a plausible interpretation of how productivity and recursion relate to cognitive architecture. In section 4, we will explore the idea that connectionist models can be seen as implementations of classical architecture.\\n\\nFor now, we consider the status of productivity arguments for classical architectures as unresolved. We will present a different argument for the need for articulated internal structure in mental representations. This argument is related to the productivity argument but does not require idealizing unbounded competence. Its assumptions should be acceptable even to theorists, like connectionists, who believe that the finitistic nature of cognitive capacities is intrinsic to their architecture.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{3.2 Systematicity of Cognitive Representation}\\n\\nThe argument is structured as follows: regardless of whether cognitive capacities are genuinely productive, it is undeniable that they are what we term 'systematic.' We will demonstrate that the systematicity of cognition offers a compelling reason to propose a combinatorial structure in mental representation, similar to the argument for the productivity of cognition, but based on a less robust premise.\\n\\nTo grasp the concept of systematicity in cognitive capacities, it is helpful to consider the systematicity of language comprehension and production. The argument for combinatorial structure in thought mirrors the traditional structuralist argument for constituent structure in sentences. However, it is important to note that while linguistic capacity is a prime example of systematic cognition, it is unlikely to be the sole instance. Systematicity is likely a pervasive feature of both human and non-human cognition.\\n\\nWhen we say linguistic capacities are systematic, we mean that the ability to produce or understand certain sentences is inherently linked to the ability to produce or understand others. This is evident when comparing how we learn languages naturally versus memorizing a phrasebook. The issue with phrasebooks is not their finite nature, which limits them to non-productive languages, but rather that one can learn parts of a phrasebook independently of others. Thus, on the phrasebook model, one could learn to say 'Granny's cat is on Uncle Arthur's mat' without knowing how to say 'it's raining' or 'Uncle Arthur's cat is on Granny's mat.' This is clearly not how native language acquisition works; native speakers do not know how to say 'John loves the girl' without also knowing how to say 'the girl loves John.'\\n\\nSystematicity pertains to the mastery of a language's syntax, not its lexicon. The phrasebook model accurately describes vocabulary learning, where acquiring one word does not necessitate knowledge of another. Systematicity, like productivity, is a property of cognitive capacities that might be overlooked if one focuses solely on the psychology of learning and list searching.\\n\\nThere is a straightforward and traditional argument from the systematicity of language capacity to the conclusion that sentences must have syntactic and semantic structure. Assuming sentences are constructed from words and phrases, and that many sequences of words can form phrases of the same type, the fact that one formula is a sentence implies that others must be as well. Systematicity follows from the postulation of constituent structure.\\n\\nFor instance, if English allows formulas with the structure 'NP Vt NP' to be well-formed, and 'John' and 'the girl' are NPs while 'loves' is a Vt, then 'John loves the girl,' 'John loves John,' 'the girl loves the girl,' and 'the girl loves John' must all be sentences. Anyone who has mastered English grammar must have systematic linguistic capacities regarding these sentences; they must recognize all as sentences if they recognize any. In contrast, if English sentences were atomic, there would be no structural analogy between 'John loves the girl' and 'the girl loves John,' and no reason why understanding one should imply understanding the other, just as understanding 'rabbit' does not imply understanding 'tree.'\\n\\nIf sentences are atomic, the systematicity of linguistic capacities is puzzling; if they have constituent structure, systematicity is expected. Thus, the latter view is preferable. This argument for constituent structure in sentences does not require idealizing to vast computational capacities. Productivity arguments for constituent structure concern our theoretical ability to understand arbitrarily long sentences. Systematicity, however, relies on more immediate premises, such as the observation that no speaker understands 'John loves the girl' without also understanding 'the girl loves John.' While a connectionist might reject the assumption of productive linguistic capacities 'in principle,' the fact of systematicity is undeniable.\\n\\nThe argument from the systematicity of linguistic capacities to constituent structure in sentences is clear. Thought is systematic too, leading to a parallel argument for syntactic and semantic structure in mental representations.\\n\\nWhat does it mean to say thought is systematic? Just as you don't find people who understand 'John loves the girl' but not 'the girl loves John,' you don't find people who can think the thought 'John loves the girl' but not 'the girl loves John.' For verbal organisms, the systematicity of thought follows from the systematicity of language, assuming, as most psychologists do, that understanding a sentence involves entertaining the thought it expresses. Thus, no one could understand both sentences about John and the girl without being able to think both thoughts.\\n\\nIf the ability to think 'John loves the girl' is intrinsically connected to thinking 'the girl loves John,' this must be explained. For a representationalist, the explanation is clear: entertaining thoughts requires being in representational states, or tokening mental representations. Just as the systematicity of language indicates structural relations between 'John loves the girl' and 'the girl loves John,' the systematicity of thought indicates structural relations between the corresponding mental representations. These mental representations, like the sentences, must be composed of the same parts. If this explanation is correct, mental representations have internal structure, and there is a language of thought. Thus, the mind's architecture is not a connectionist network.\\n\\nTo summarize: productivity arguments infer the internal structure of mental representations from the assumption that intellectual competence is not finite. Systematicity arguments infer this structure from the evident fact that intellectual competence is not isolated. Just as linguistic capacities do not consist of understanding 67 unrelated sentences, cognitive capacities do not consist of thinking 74 unrelated thoughts. This is not accidental: a linguistic theory allowing for isolated languages would be profoundly incorrect, as would a cognitive theory allowing for isolated minds.\\n\\nPerhaps non-isolated minds are unique to language users; perhaps infra-verbal organisms have representational gaps that connectionist models allow. A connectionist might claim to model everything 'up to language' without assuming combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure in mental representations. While this may cover a lot, it is not everything. Infra-verbal cognitive architecture must not be represented in a way that makes language acquisition in phylogeny and ontogeny miraculous.\\n\\nHowever, it is implausible that only verbal organisms have systematic minds. If this were true, we would find animals capable of representing 'a R b' but not 'b R a,' effectively 'a R b' sighted but 'b R a' blind. Such animals would learn to respond to 'a R b' situations but not 'b R a' situations. For example, they could learn to choose a picture with a larger square than a triangle but not the reverse.\\n\\nWhile it is an empirical question whether infra-verbal organisms often have such cognitive structures, we bet they do not. Ethological cases are exceptions that prove the rule. In cases where environmental configurations act as 'gestalten,' it is reasonable to doubt the complexity of mental representation. These cases are exceptional, often with special ecological significance, such as predator shapes or conspecific songs. Conversely, without such stories, structurally similar stimuli should elicit similar cognitive capacities, as a respectable principle of stimulus generalization requires.\\n\\nIn short, the systematicity of infra-verbal cognition is as secure an empirical premise as any in this field. As we have seen, it straightforwardly demonstrates the inadequacy of connectionist models as cognitive theories, just as it would if such capacities were generally productive.\",\n"," '### 3.3 Compositionality of Representations\\n\\nCompositionality is intimately linked to systematicity; they might be best understood as facets of a single phenomenon. Thus, we will approach this topic similarly to our previous discussion. We begin by introducing the concept through the standard arguments for the compositionality of natural languages. We then propose that similar arguments support the compositionality of mental representations. Since compositionality necessitates a combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure, the compositionality of thought suggests that the mind is not merely a connectionist network.\\n\\nWe previously stated that the systematicity of linguistic competence is characterized by the intrinsic connection between the ability to produce/understand certain sentences and the ability to produce/understand others. We now add that the systematic relationship between sentences is not arbitrary from a semantic perspective. For instance, understanding \"John loves the girl\" is related to understanding \"the girl loves John,\" with close semantic ties between these sentences. For the first to be true, John must have the same relationship to the girl as the girl has to John in the second. In contrast, there is no intrinsic connection between understanding these sentences and unrelated ones like \"quarks are made of gluons\" or \"the cat is on the mat\" or \"2+2=4.\" Semantic relatedness and systematicity appear closely linked.\\n\\nYou might assume this co-variance is explained by the same reasoning that accounts for systematicity itself; namely, that systematically related sentences are composed of the same syntactic constituents. However, an additional assumption is needed, which we\\'ll call the \\'principle of compositionality\\': in a systematic language, a lexical item must contribute approximately the same semantic value to each expression in which it appears. For example, \"the,\" \"girl,\" \"loves,\" and \"John\" must contribute the same semantic value to both \"John loves the girl\" and \"the girl loves John\" for understanding one to imply understanding the other. Similarity in constituent structure accounts for the semantic relatedness between systematically related sentences only if the semantic properties of the shared constituents are context-independent.\\n\\nIdioms illustrate this rule: understanding \"the,\" \"man,\" \"kicked,\" and \"bucket\" doesn\\'t help much with understanding \"the man kicked the bucket,\" as \"kicked\" and \"bucket\" don\\'t carry their standard meanings in this context. As expected, \"the man kicked the bucket\" is not systematic even with syntactically similar sentences like \"the man kicked over the bucket\" (or even with \"the man kicked the bucket\" read literally).\\n\\nThe extent to which natural languages are truly compositional (or systematic) is uncertain. We suspect that context-induced variations in lexical meaning are often overestimated because other types of context sensitivity are mistaken for violations of compositionality. For example, the difference between \"feed the chicken\" and \"chicken to eat\" likely involves an animal/food ambiguity in \"chicken\" rather than a violation of compositionality. If the context \"feed the ...\" could induce (rather than select) the meaning animal, you would expect \"feed the veal,\" \"feed the pork,\" and similar phrases. Similarly, the difference between \"good book,\" \"good rest,\" and \"good fight\" is probably not a shift in meaning but syncategorematicity. \"Good NP\" means something like NP that satisfies the relevant interest in NPs: a good book is one that satisfies our interest in books (i.e., it\\'s good to read); a good rest is one that satisfies our interest in rests (i.e., it leaves one refreshed); a good fight is one that satisfies our interest in fights (i.e., it\\'s fun to watch or participate in, or it clears the air); and so on. Because the meaning of \"good\" is syncategorematic and includes a variable for relevant interests, you can know that a good flurg is a flurg that satisfies the relevant interest in flurgs without knowing what flurgs are or what the relevant interest in flurgs is (see Ziff, 1960).\\n\\nIn any case, the main argument remains: systematicity depends on compositionality, so to the extent that a natural language is systematic, it must also be compositional. This illustrates another way in which systematicity arguments can fulfill the role traditionally played by productivity arguments. The traditional argument for compositionality is that it is necessary to explain how a finitely representable language can contain infinitely many non-synonymous expressions.\\n\\nConsiderations about systematicity provide one argument for compositionality; considerations about entailment provide another. Consider predicates like \"... is a brown cow.\" This expression has a straightforward semantic relationship to the predicates \"... is a cow\" and \"... is brown\"; namely, the first predicate is true of something if and only if both of the others are. That is, \"... is a brown cow\" entails \"... is brown\" and \"... is a cow\" and is entailed by their conjunction. Moreover, this semantic pattern is not unique to the examples given. On the contrary, it applies to a wide range of predicates (e.g., \"... is a red square,\" \"... is a funny old German soldier,\" \"... is a child prodigy,\" and so forth).\\n\\nHow do we account for these regularities? The answer seems clear: \"... is a brown cow\" entails \"... is brown\" because (a) the second expression is a constituent of the first; (b) the syntactical form \"(adjective noun) NN\" often has the semantic force of a conjunction; and (c) \"brown\" retains its semantic value under the simplification of conjunction. Notice that you need (c) to rule out the possibility that \"brown\" means brown when it modifies a noun but (as it might be) dead when it\\'s a predicate adjective; in which case \"... is a brown cow\" wouldn\\'t entail \"... is brown\" after all. Notice too that (c) is just an application of the principle of composition.\\n\\nSo, here\\'s the argument so far: you need to assume some degree of compositionality in English sentences to account for the fact that systematically related sentences are always semantically related; and to account for certain regular parallelisms between the syntactical structure of sentences and their entailments. So, beyond any serious doubt, the sentences of English must be compositional to some significant extent. But the principle of compositionality governs the semantic relations between words and the expressions of which they are constituents. So compositionality implies that (some) expressions have constituents. Thus, compositionality argues for (specifically, presupposes) syntactic/semantic structure in sentences.\\n\\nNow, what about the compositionality of mental representations? As expected, there is a bridging argument based on the usual psycholinguistic premise that language is used to express thoughts. Sentences are used to express thoughts; so if the ability to use some sentences is connected with the ability to use certain other, semantically related, sentences, then the ability to think some thoughts must be correspondingly connected with the ability to think certain other, semantically related, thoughts. But you can only think the thoughts that your mental representations can express. So, if the ability to think certain thoughts is interconnected, then the corresponding representational capacities must be interconnected too; specifically, the ability to be in some representational states must imply the ability to be in certain other, semantically related representational states.\\n\\nBut then the question arises: how could the mind be so arranged that the ability to be in one representational state is connected with the ability to be in others that are semantically nearby? What account of mental representation would have this consequence? The answer is just what you\\'d expect from the discussion of the linguistic material. Mental representations must have internal structure, just as sentences do. In particular, it must be that the mental representation corresponding to the thought that John loves the girl contains, as its parts, the same constituents as the mental representation corresponding to the thought that the girl loves John. That would explain why these thoughts are systematically related; and, to the extent that the semantic value of these parts is context-independent, that would explain why these systematically related thoughts are also semantically related. So, by this chain of argument, evidence for the compositionality of sentences is evidence for the compositionality of the representational states of speaker/hearers.\\n\\nFinally, what about the compositionality of infra-verbal thought? The argument isn\\'t much different from the one we\\'ve just discussed. We assume that animal thought is largely systematic: an organism that can perceive (hence learn) that a R b can generally perceive (/learn) that b R a. But, systematically related thoughts (just like systematically related sentences) are generally semantically related too. It\\'s no surprise that being able to learn that the triangle is above the square implies being able to learn that the square is above the triangle; whereas it would be very surprising if being able to learn the square/triangle facts implied being able to learn that quarks are made of gluons or that Washington was the first President of America.\\n\\nSo, then, what explains the correlation between systematic relations and semantic relations in infra-verbal thought? Clearly, connectionist models don\\'t address this question; the fact that a network contains a node labeled X has, as far as the constraints imposed by connectionist architecture are concerned, no implications at all for the labels of the other nodes in the network; in particular, it doesn\\'t imply that there will be nodes that represent thoughts that are semantically close to X. This is just the semantical side of the fact that network architectures permit arbitrarily punctate mental lives. But if, on the other hand, we make the usual Classicist assumptions (viz. that systematically related thoughts share constituents and that the semantic values of these shared constituents are context-independent), the correlation between systematicity and semantic relatedness follows immediately. For a classicist, this correlation is an \\'architectural\\' property of minds; it couldn\\'t but hold if mental representations have the general properties that classical models suppose them to.\\n\\nWhat do connectionists have to say about these matters? There is some textual evidence that they are tempted to deny the facts of compositionality wholesale. For example, Smolensky (chapter 2) claims that:\\n\\n\"Surely... we would get quite a different representation of \\'coffee\\' if we examined the difference between \\'can with coffee\\' and \\'can without coffee\\' or \\'tree with coffee\\' and \\'tree without coffee\\'; or \\'man with coffee\\' and \\'man without coffee\\'... context insensitivity is not something we expect to be reflected in connectionist representations....\"\\n\\nIt\\'s certainly true that compositionality is not generally a feature of connectionist representations. Connectionists can\\'t acknowledge the facts of compositionality because they are committed to mental representations that don\\'t have combinatorial structure. But to give up on compositionality is to take \"kick the bucket\" as a model for the relation between syntax and semantics; and the consequence is, as we\\'ve seen, that you make the systematicity of language (and of thought) a mystery. On the other hand, to say that \"kick the bucket\" is aberrant, and that the right model for the syntax/semantics relation is (e.g.) \"brown cow,\" is to start down a trail that leads, quite inevitably, to acknowledging combinatorial structure in mental representation, hence to the rejection of connectionist networks as cognitive models.\\n\\nWe don\\'t think there\\'s any way out of the need to acknowledge the compositionality of natural languages and mental representations. However, it\\'s been suggested (see Smolensky, chapter 2) that while the principle of compositionality is false (because content isn\\'t context invariant), there is nevertheless a \\'family resemblance\\' between the various meanings that a symbol has in the various contexts in which it occurs. Since such proposals generally aren\\'t elaborated, it\\'s unclear how they\\'re supposed to handle the salient facts about systematicity and inference. But surely there are going to be serious problems. Consider, for example, such inferences as:\\n\\n(i) Turtles are slower than rabbits.  \\n(ii) Rabbits are slower than Ferraris.  \\n(iii) Turtles are slower than Ferraris.\\n\\nThe soundness of this inference appears to depend upon (a) the fact that the same relation (viz. slower than) holds between turtles and rabbits on the one hand, and rabbits and Ferraris on the other; and (b) the fact that that relation is transitive. If, however, it\\'s assumed (contrary to the principle of compositionality) that \"slower than\" means something different in premises (i) and (ii) (and presumably in (iii) as well) - so that, strictly speaking, the relation that holds between turtles and rabbits is not the same one that holds between rabbits and Ferraris - then it\\'s hard to see why the inference should be valid.\\n\\nTalk about the relations being \\'similar\\' only papers over the difficulty since the problem is then to provide a notion of similarity that will guarantee that if (i) and (ii) are true, so too is (iii). And, so far at least, no such notion of similarity has been forthcoming. Notice that it won\\'t do to require just that the relations all be similar in respect of their transitivity, i.e., that they all be transitive. On that account, the argument from \"turtles are slower than rabbits\" and \"rabbits are furrier than Ferraris\" to \"turtles are slower than Ferraris\" would be valid since \"furrier than\" is transitive too.\\n\\nUntil these sorts of issues are addressed, the proposal to replace the compositional principle of context invariance with a notion of \\'approximate equivalence across contexts\\' (Smolensky, chapter 2, p. 67) doesn\\'t seem to be much more than hand-waving.',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{3.4 The Systematicity of Inference}\\n\\nIn Section 2, we discussed how Classical theories propose that the syntax of mental representations serves as a bridge between their semantic properties and their causal roles in mental processes. Consider a straightforward example: a \\'logical\\' principle states that conjunctions entail their constituents (thus, the argument from $P \\\\land Q$ to $P$ and to $Q$ is valid). Similarly, a psychological law suggests that thoughts of $P \\\\land Q$ tend to lead to thoughts of $P$ and thoughts of $Q$, all else being equal. Classical theory leverages the constituent structure of mental representations to explain both these phenomena: the first by positing that the combinatorial semantics of mental representations are sensitive to their syntax, and the second by assuming that mental processes operate on mental representations based on their constituent structure.\\n\\nA consequence of these assumptions is that Classical theories predict that inferences of similar logical types should generally elicit similar cognitive capacities. For instance, you shouldn\\'t encounter a mental framework where inferences from $P \\\\land Q \\\\land R$ to $P$ occur, but inferences from $P \\\\land Q$ to $P$ do not. According to the Classical account, this logically homogeneous class of inferences is executed by a correspondingly homogeneous class of psychological mechanisms. The premises of both inferences are expressed by mental representations that share the same syntactic analysis (i.e., $S_{1} \\\\land S_{2} \\\\land S_{3} \\\\land \\\\ldots S_{n}$), and the process of drawing the inference corresponds, in both cases, to the same formal operation of detaching the constituent that expresses the conclusion.\\n\\nThe notion that organisms should exhibit similar cognitive capacities for logically similar inferences seems so intuitive that it might appear inevitable. However, this is not necessarily the case. There is no inherent reason to rule out a cognitive model where inferences that are similar from a logician\\'s perspective are computed by entirely different mechanisms, or where some inferences of a given logical type are computed while others of the same type are not. Consider, for example, the Connectionist account. A connectionist can certainly model a mental life where, if you can reason from $P \\\\land Q \\\\land R$ to $P$, you can also reason from $P \\\\land Q$ to $P$. For instance, the network in Figure 3.3 would suffice.\\n\\nFigure 3.3: A possible connectionist network that draws inferences from $P \\\\land Q \\\\land R$ to $P$ and also from $P \\\\land Q$ to $P$.\\n\\nHowever, a connectionist can also model a mental life where one of these inferences occurs without the other. In this scenario, since there is no structural relationship between the $P \\\\land Q \\\\land R$ node and the $P \\\\land Q$ node (remember, all nodes are atomic; do not be misled by the node labels), there is no reason why a mind containing the first should also contain the second, or vice versa. Similarly, there is no reason why you shouldn\\'t find minds that simplify the premises \"John loves Mary\" and \"Bill hates Mary\" but no others; or minds that simplify premises with 1, 3, or 5 conjuncts, but not those with 2, 4, or 6 conjuncts; or, for that matter, minds that simplify only premises acquired on Tuesdays, and so on.\\n\\nIn fact, the connectionist architecture is entirely indifferent to these possibilities. This is because it does not recognize any notion of syntax that aligns thoughts with similar inferential roles (e.g., thoughts subject to simplification of conjunction) with mental representations of similar syntactic form (e.g., syntactically conjunctive mental representations). Thus, the connectionist architecture allows for gaps in cognitive capacities; it lacks a mechanism to enforce the requirement that logically homogeneous inferences be executed by correspondingly homogeneous computational processes.\\n\\nHowever, we argue that you do not find cognitive capacities with such gaps. For example, you do not encounter minds prepared to infer \"John went to the store\" from \"John and Mary and Susan and Sally went to the store\" and from \"John and Mary went to the store,\" but not from \"John and Mary and Susan went to the store.\" Given a notion of logical syntax—the very notion that the Classical theory of mentation requires to ground its account of mental processes—it is evident that such minds do not exist. Without a notion of logical syntax, it remains a mystery why they do not.',\n"," \"# The Lure of Connectionism\\n\\nThe current enthusiasm for the connectionist approach among psychologists and philosophers is intriguing, especially considering the challenges previously highlighted. These challenges were instrumental in the development of a syntax-based (proof-theoretic) notion of computation and a Turing-style, symbol-processing concept of cognitive architecture. Despite this, several seemingly convincing arguments frequently appear in the literature, emphasizing the limitations of conventional computers as models of the brain. These arguments are often seen as supporting the connectionist alternative. We will outline some of these arguments before discussing the broader issues they seem to present.\\n\\n**Rapidity of Cognitive Processes Relative to Neural Speeds: The 'Hundred Step' Constraint**\\n\\nIt has been noted (e.g., Feldman and Ballard, 1982) that executing computer instructions takes nanoseconds, whereas neurons require tens of milliseconds to fire. Consequently, in the time it takes for people to perform tasks they are proficient at (such as recognizing a word or a picture, which may take less than a second), a serial neurally instantiated program could only execute about 100 instructions. Yet, such tasks might typically require thousands or even millions of instructions on current computers (if they can be done at all). Thus, it is argued that the brain must operate differently from computers, likely in a highly parallel manner ('massively parallel' is the preferred term).\\n\\n**Challenges in Achieving Large-Capacity Pattern Recognition and Content-Based Retrieval in Conventional Architectures**\\n\\nClosely related to time constraints is the observation that humans can store and utilize vast amounts of information seemingly effortlessly (Fahlman and Hinton, 1987). A particularly striking human ability is recognizing patterns among tens or even hundreds of thousands of alternatives (e.g., word or face recognition). There is reason to believe that many expert skills may rely on large, fast recognition memories (see Simon and Chase, 1973). If one had to search through memory serially, as conventional computers do, the complexity would overwhelm any machine. Thus, human knowledge must be stored and retrieved differently from conventional computers.\\n\\n**Conventional Computer Models and the Etiology of 'Rule-Governed' and 'Exceptional' Behavior**\\n\\nClassical psychological theories, based on conventional computer ideas, typically distinguish between mechanisms causing regular and divergent behavior by postulating systems of explicit unconscious rules to explain the former and attributing deviations to secondary (performance) factors. Since divergent behaviors occur frequently, a better strategy would be to account for both types of behavior using the same mechanism.\\n\\n**Lack of Progress in Addressing Non-Verbal or Intuitive Processes**\\n\\nMost of our fluent cognitive skills do not involve accessing verbal knowledge or engaging in deliberate conscious reasoning (Fahlman and Hinton, 1987; Smolensky, Chapter 2). We seem to know many things that are difficult to describe verbally, such as how to ride a bicycle, recognize close friends, or recall the name of the President. Such knowledge, it is argued, must be stored in a non-linguistic, 'implicit' form. The fact that conventional computers typically operate in a 'linguistic mode,' processing information by manipulating syntactically structured expressions, may explain the limited success in modeling implicit knowledge.\\n\\n**Sensitivity of Conventional Architectures to Damage and Noise**\\n\\nUnlike digital circuits, brain circuits must tolerate noise from spontaneous neural activity and withstand moderate damage without complete failure. With few exceptions, if part of the brain is damaged, performance degradation is usually gradual rather than catastrophic. This is especially true of memory. Damage to the temporal cortex (often associated with memory traces) does not result in the selective loss of specific facts and memories. This suggests that human memory representations, and possibly many other cognitive skills, are spatially distributed rather than neurally localized. This contrasts with conventional computers, where hierarchical control keeps crucial decisions highly localized, and memory storage consists of an array of location-addressable registers.\\n\\n**Passive Storage in Conventional Architectures**\\n\\nConventional computers have a passive memory store accessed through a 'fetch and execute cycle,' which seems unlike human memory. For example, according to Kosslyn and Hatfield (1984, pp. 1022, 1029), if one switches from imaging the letter 'A' to 'B,' the 'fatigue' inhibiting imaging 'A' would be due to a quirk in the CPU's execution of a given instruction. Such fatigue should generalize to all objects imaged because the routine responsible for imaging was less effective. However, experiments show this is not true: specific objects become more difficult to image, not all objects. This finding is more easily explained by an analogy to how invisible ink fades on its own; the representation itself is doing something without a separate processor working over it.\\n\\n**Conventional Rule-Based Systems and 'All-or-None' Cognition**\\n\\nCognitive skills appear to be characterized by various continuities. For example:\\n\\n1. Continuous variation in the applicability of different principles or the relevance of different constraints, 'rules,' or procedures. In perception and memory retrieval, various constraints often simultaneously influence a problem, resulting in a combined effect of all factors (see McClelland et al., 1986b, pp. 3-9). This is why 'constraint propagation' techniques are gaining attention in artificial intelligence (see Mackworth, 1987).\\n\\n2. Non-determinism of human behavior: cognitive processes are never rigidly determined or precisely replicable. They seem to have a significant random or stochastic component, possibly due to microscopic randomness from irrelevant biochemical or electrical activity or even quantum mechanical events. Modeling this activity with rigid deterministic rules can lead to poor predictions, as it ignores the fundamentally stochastic nature of the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, deterministic, all-or-none models cannot account for the gradual aspect of learning and skill acquisition.\\n\\n3. Failure to display graceful degradation: when humans cannot perform a task perfectly, they still do something reasonable. If a task does not fit exactly into a known pattern or is only partly understood, a person will not give up or produce nonsensical behavior. In contrast, if a classical rule-based computer program fails to recognize a task or match a pattern to its stored representations or rules, it usually cannot do anything at all. This suggests that to display graceful degradation, we must represent prototypes, match patterns, and recognize problems in various degrees.\\n\\n4. Conventional models are dictated by current technical features of computers and take little or no account of neuroscience facts. Classical symbol-processing systems provide no indication of how the processes they postulate could be realized by a brain. The large gap between high-level systems and brain architecture might indicate that these models are on the wrong track.\\n\\nWhile the architecture of the mind has evolved under natural selection pressures, some classical assumptions about the mind may derive from features that computers have only because they are explicitly designed for programmers' convenience. This might even include the assumption that the description of mental processes at the cognitive level can be divorced from their physical realization. At a minimum, building our models to consider known neural structures may reduce the risk of being misled by metaphors based on contemporary computer architectures.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{5 Replies: Why the Common Arguments for Favoring Connectionist Architecture are Flawed}\\n\\nWe believe that the typical arguments against classical cognitive architecture are flawed due to one of the following two reasons:\\n\\n1. The objections are based on characteristics that are not inherently part of classical architectures. There can be perfectly valid classical models that do not display the criticized features. For instance, we believe this applies to the arguments suggesting that classical rules are explicit and that classical operations are 'all or none.'\\n\\n2. The objections are applicable to classical architectures only as they are currently implemented on existing computers. These criticisms may not hold true if such architectures are implemented differently, such as through neural means. In other words, these objections target the implementation level rather than the cognitive level, as we previously distinguished. We believe this is the case for arguments concerning speed, resistance to damage and noise, and the passivity of memory.\\n\\nIn the following section, we will elaborate on these two points and connect them to some of the arguments mentioned earlier. After this analysis, we will propose what we consider to be the most viable perspective on connectionism: that it is a theory of how (classical) cognitive systems might be implemented, either in actual brains or within some form of 'abstract neurology.'\",\n"," \"### 5.1 Parallel Computation and the Issue of Speed\\n\\nThere is an argument suggesting that cognitive processes must involve large-scale parallel computation. In typical connectionist discussions, this argument is often irrelevant to the adequacy of classical cognitive architecture. For instance, the 'hundred step' constraint is clearly aimed at the implementation level. It merely dismisses the (absurd) hypothesis that cognitive architectures are implemented in the brain in the same manner as they are on electronic computers.\\n\\nIf you're uncertain whether a proposal pertains to the implementation level or the symbolic level, a useful heuristic is to consider whether the claim holds true for a conventional computer, such as the DEC VAX, at its implementation level. Although most algorithms running on the VAX are serial, at the implementation level, such computers are 'massively parallel'; they involve simultaneous electrical activity throughout almost the entire device. For example, every memory access cycle involves pulsing every bit in a significant fraction of the system's memory registers, as memory access is essentially a destructive read and rewrite process. The system clock regularly pulses and activates most of the central processing unit, and so on.\\n\\nThe key takeaway is that the absolute speed of a process is primarily a property of its implementation. In contrast, the relative speed with which a system responds to different inputs often indicates distinct processes. This has always been a crucial empirical basis for choosing among alternative algorithms in information-processing psychology. Therefore, the fact that individual neurons require tens of milliseconds to fire does not affect the predicted speed at which an algorithm will run unless there is at least a partially, independently motivated theory of how the operations of the functional architecture are implemented in neurons. In the case of the brain, it is not even certain that the firing of neurons is invariably the relevant implementation property, especially for higher-level cognitive processes like learning and memory. Thus, the 'hundred step' constraint excludes nothing.\\n\\nFinally, absolute constraints on the number of serial steps a mental process can require, or the time needed to execute them, provide weak arguments against classical architecture. This is because classical architecture does not exclude the parallel execution of multiple symbolic processes. It seems highly likely that many classical symbolic processes occur in parallel in cognition and that these processes interact with one another, possibly involving some form of symbolic constraint propagation. Operating on symbols can even involve 'massively parallel' organizations, which might imply new architectures. However, they remain classical in our sense, as they share the classical conception of computation as symbol-processing. For examples of serious and interesting proposals on organizing classical processors into large parallel networks, see Hewett's 1977 Actor system, Hillis' 1985 'Connection Machine', and various recent commercial multi-processor machines. The point is that advocating for a network of parallel computers is not inherently an argument against classical architecture or in favor of connectionist architecture.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{5.2 Resistance to Noise and Physical Damage (and the Argument for Distributed Representation)}\\n\\nSome advantages attributed to connectionist architectures over classical ones are clearly focused on the implementation level. For instance, the criterion of 'resistance to physical damage' is so evidently an implementation issue that it should scarcely be a topic in discussions of cognitive-level theories.\\n\\nIt is true that a certain type of damage resistance seems incompatible with localization, and representations in parallel distributed processing (PDP) systems are indeed distributed across groups of units, especially when 'coarse coding' is employed. However, distribution across units only achieves damage resistance if it implies that representations are also neurally distributed. Neural distribution of representations is just as feasible in classical architectures as it is in connectionist networks. In classical systems, all that is required are memory registers that distribute their contents across physical space. This can be achieved with advanced storage systems like optical or chemical ones, or even with registers composed of connectionist networks. In fact, this concept was already present in the old 'ferrite core' memories.\\n\\nThe physical requirements of a classical symbol-processing system are often misunderstood. The confusion between physical and functional properties is common in psychological theorizing; for a discussion of this confusion in relation to metrical properties in models of mental imagery, see Pylyshyn (1981). For example, conventional architecture necessitates distinct symbolic expressions for each state of affairs it can represent. Since these expressions often have a structure made of concatenated parts, the adjacency relation must be instantiated by some physical relation when the architecture is implemented (see the discussion in note 9). However, since the relation to be physically realized is functional adjacency, there is no requirement for physically adjacent symbols to be spatially adjacent. Similarly, although complex expressions are constructed from atomic elements, and the distinction between atomic and complex symbols must be physically instantiated, there is no requirement for a token of an atomic symbol to occupy a smaller space than a token of a complex symbol, even if it is a constituent of the complex symbol. In classical architectures, as in connectionist networks, functional elements can be physically distributed or localized to any extent. In a VAX (to use our heuristic again), pairs of symbols may be functionally adjacent, yet the symbol tokens can be spatially dispersed across many locations in physical memory.\\n\\nIn summary, the fact that a property (like the position of a symbol within an expression) is functionally local has no implications for damage resistance or noise tolerance unless the functional neighborhood metric corresponds to some appropriate physical dimension. When this is the case, we may predict adverse effects that changes in the physical property have on objects localized in functional space (e.g., varying the voltage or line frequency might damage the left part of an expression). However, the situation is the same for connectionist systems: even if they are resistant to spatially local damage, they may not be resistant to damage that is local along other physical dimensions. Since spatially local damage is particularly common in real-world scenarios, this may have significant practical implications. However, as long as our understanding of how cognitive processes might be mapped onto brain tissue remains limited, its relevance to cognitive science remains uncertain.\",\n"," '### 5.3 \\'Soft\\' Constraints, Continuous Magnitudes, Stochastic Mechanisms, and Active Symbols\\n\\nThe idea that \\'soft\\' constraints, which can vary continuously like degrees of activation, are incompatible with classical rule-based symbolic systems is a misunderstanding that arises from failing to distinguish between the psychological (or symbol-processing) level and the implementation level. It is entirely feasible to have a classical rule system where the decision about which rule to activate is embedded in the functional architecture and depends on continuously varying magnitudes. This approach is commonly used in practical \\'expert systems,\\' which, for instance, employ Bayesian mechanisms in their production-system rule interpreters. The soft or stochastic nature of rule-based processes emerges from the interaction of deterministic rules with real-valued properties of the implementation or with noisy inputs or information transmission.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that rule applications do not necessarily result in \\'all-or-none\\' behaviors. Multiple rules can be activated simultaneously, leading to interactive effects on the outcome. Alternatively, each activated rule can produce independent parallel effects, which may be resolved later, depending on which parallel stream achieves a goal first. A crucial, though sometimes overlooked, point about aggregate properties of overt behavior—such as continuity, \\'fuzziness,\\' and randomness—is that they do not necessarily stem from underlying mechanisms that are themselves fuzzy, continuous, or random. It is both theoretically possible and practically reasonable to assume that seemingly variable or non-deterministic behavior arises from the interaction of multiple deterministic sources.\\n\\nA similar argument applies to the concept of \\'graceful degradation.\\' Classical architecture does not mandate that processes should completely fail when the conditions for applying available rules are not precisely met. As mentioned earlier, rules can be activated to varying degrees based on how closely their conditions are met. The outcome in these cases may depend on the implementation of the rule system. Alternatively, the lack of \\'graceful degradation\\' might be an inherent limitation of the current class of models or even of current approaches to designing intelligent systems. It is evident that existing psychological models are inadequate across a broad range of measures, and their issues with graceful degradation may be a specific instance of their general lack of intelligence: they may simply lack the sophistication to know what to do when a limited set of methods fails to apply. However, this need not be a fundamental limitation of classical architectures. To our knowledge, there is no reason to believe that concepts like Newell\\'s (1969) \\'hierarchy of weak methods\\' or Laird et al.\\'s (1986) \\'universal subgoaling\\' are inherently incapable of addressing the problem of graceful degradation. (Similarly, no argument has been presented that connectionist architectures are inherently capable of addressing it. In fact, current connectionist models fail just as gracelessly as those based on classical architectures. For example, contrary to some claims, models like McClelland and Kawamoto\\'s (1986) fail quite unnaturally when given incomplete information.)\\n\\nIn summary, classical theorists can view the stochastic properties of behavior as emerging from interactions between the model and the intrinsic properties of the physical medium in which it is realized. It is crucial to remember that, from the classical perspective, overt behavior is primarily an interaction effect, and symbol manipulations are intended to be just one of the interacting causes.\\n\\nThese considerations also apply to Kosslyn and Hatfield\\'s (1984) comments about the commitment of classical models to \\'passive\\' versus \\'active\\' representations. While it is true, as Kosslyn and Hatfield state, that the representations manipulated by von Neumann machines \\'don\\'t do anything until a CPU operates upon them (they don\\'t decay, for example),\\' even if we assume, absurdly, that the mind has the exact architecture of a contemporary (von Neumann) computer, it is clear that its behavior, and thus the behavior of an organism, is determined not just by the logical machine that the mind instantiates, but also by the biological machine in which the logic is realized. Instantiated representations are therefore inherently active, even according to classical models; the question is whether the type of activity they exhibit should be explained by the cognitive model or by the theory of its implementation. This question is empirical and should not be assumed in favor of the connectionist view. (As it is, for example, in passages like:\\n\\n\"The brain itself does not manipulate symbols; the brain is the medium in which the symbols are floating and in which they trigger each other. There is no central manipulator, no central program. There is simply a vast collection of \\'teams\\'—patterns of neural firings that, like teams of ants, trigger other patterns of neural firings... We feel those symbols churning within ourselves in somewhat the same way we feel our stomach churning.\" (Hofstadter, 1983, p. 279)\\n\\nThis appears to be a serious case of Formicidae in machina: ants in the stomach of the ghost in the machine.)',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{5.4 Explicitness of Rules}\\n\\nMcClelland et al. (1986a, p. 6) suggest that connectionist models are prompting a reevaluation of fundamental psychological concepts, particularly regarding how knowledge is represented. Traditionally, knowledge has been viewed as a set of rules accessed by processing mechanisms during cognitive tasks. In contrast, connectionist models depict knowledge as being embedded, often in a distributed manner, within the connections among processing units.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the introduction, we find the assertion that most psychological processes are implicitly rule-based, along with the idea that both divergent and compliant behaviors stem from the same cognitive mechanisms, to be intriguing yet debatable. We consider these issues to be largely empirical and, in many instances, unresolved. Regardless, it is crucial not to conflate the distinction between rule-implicit and rule-explicit processes with the difference between classical and connectionist architectures.\\n\\nThis confusion is prevalent in connectionist literature, where it is often assumed that classical models assert that regular behaviors must originate from explicitly encoded rules. This assumption is incorrect. Classical models are not inherently required to be rule-explicit. In fact, debates about which, if any, rules are explicitly represented mentally have persisted for decades within the classicist community. For instance, discussions on the explicitness of grammatical rules can be found in Stabler (1985) and related responses, while Cummins (1983) offers a philosophical perspective. Classical theorists generally agree that not all behavioral regularities are governed by explicit rules; some causal determinants of compliant behavior must be implicit. This argument parallels Lewis Carroll\\'s observations in \"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\" (Carroll, 1956). Other questions regarding the explicitness of rules are considered moot by classicists, with a wide range of opinions existing within the camp.\\n\\nThe fundamental point is that not all functions of a classical computer can be encoded as an explicit program; some must be hardwired. In fact, the entire program can be hardwired in cases where it does not need to modify or examine itself. In such scenarios, classical machines can be rule-implicit concerning their programs, with their state transition mechanisms being entirely subcomputational (i.e., sub-symbolic).\\n\\nWhat must be explicit in a classical machine is not its program but the symbols it writes on its tapes (or stores in its registers). These symbols correspond to the machine\\'s data structures, not its rules of transformation. For example, in programs that parse natural language, classical architecture requires the explicit representation of sentence structures but remains neutral on the explicitness of grammars, contrary to many connectionist beliefs.\\n\\nOne significant advancement in computer history—the stored-program computer—allows programs to function as data structures. However, the architecture does not mandate this. Similarly, Turing demonstrated the existence of an abstract machine (the universal Turing machine) capable of simulating any target (Turing) machine. A universal machine is \\'rule-explicit\\' about the machine it simulates, possessing an explicit representation sufficient to uniquely specify its behavior. Yet, the target machine can be \\'rule-implicit\\' regarding the rules governing its behavior.\\n\\nTherefore, one cannot critique classical cognitive architecture by demonstrating that a cognitive process is rule-implicit; classical architecture allows for rule-explicit processes but does not necessitate them. However, connectionist architectures can be challenged by showing that a cognitive process is rule-explicit, as connectionist architecture inherently lacks the logico-syntactic capacities required to encode rules and the executive mechanisms needed to apply them.\\n\\nIf compelling arguments for rule-explicit cognitive processes emerge, it would pose a significant challenge for connectionists. A promising area to explore such arguments is the theory of cognitive competence acquisition. For instance, much traditional linguistic research (see Prince and Pinker, 1988) and recent work in mathematical learning theory (see Osherson et al., 1984) assume that the typical output of a cognitive acquisition device is a recursive rule system (a grammar, in the linguistic context). If these theories prove to be well-founded, it would be incompatible with the assumption that the cognitive architecture of the acquired capacities is connectionist.',\n"," \"### 5.5 On 'Brain-Style' Modeling\\n\\nThe relationship between connectionist models and neuroscience is subject to various interpretations. On one side, researchers like Ballard (1986) and Sejnowski (1981) aim to construct models based on the properties of neurons and neural organizations, even though these neuronal units are idealized—perhaps excessively so, as noted in the commentaries following Ballard (1986). On the other side, Smolensky (Chapter 2) considers connectionist units as mathematical constructs that can be interpreted in either neural or psychological terms. Most connectionists find themselves somewhere in between, often describing their approach as 'brain-style' theorizing.\\n\\nUnderstanding both psychological principles and their neurophysiological implementation is undoubtedly more comprehensive and empirically secure than understanding only one aspect. The question, however, is whether there is any benefit to designing 'brain-style' models that do not commit to how these models map onto actual brains.\\n\\nThe premise of 'brain-style' modeling is that theories of cognitive processing should be informed by biological facts, particularly from neuroscience. The biological facts influencing connectionist models include: the significance of neuronal connections in brain activity patterns; the non-local nature of memory 'engrams'; neurons functioning as threshold elements that sum activity at their dendrites; cortical neurons having multi-dimensional 'receptive fields' sensitive to specific parameter ranges; and the modulation of synaptic activity by the frequency and recency of past firings.\\n\\nAssuming these claims are both true and relevant to brain function—a not entirely unproblematic assumption—the question arises: what implications do these facts have for understanding cognitive architecture? The unavoidable answer seems to be, very little. This is not an a priori claim; the relationship between facts at different organizational levels of a system is an empirical matter. However, skepticism is warranted regarding whether the properties listed above are directly reflected in the structure of the system responsible for reasoning.\\n\\nConsider, for instance, a prominent property of neural systems: they are networks that transmit activation, resulting in state changes of quasi-threshold elements. It is unwarranted to conclude that reasoning consists of the spread of excitation among representations or even among semantic components of representations. A VAX, for example, is also a network transmitting excitation, culminating in state changes of quasi-threshold elements. Yet, at the level of processing representations, a VAX is organized as a von Neumann architecture.\\n\\nThe point is that the structure of 'higher levels' of a system rarely mirrors, or even resembles, the structure of 'lower levels.'\\n\\nNo one expects the theory of protons to resemble the theory of rocks and rivers, even though rocks and rivers are composed of protons and similar particles. Lucretius erred by assuming a simple correspondence between macro-level and micro-level theories, such as thinking hooks and eyes hold atoms together—a notion proven incorrect.\\n\\nThere are cases where empirical considerations suggest detailed structure/function correspondences or analogies between different levels of a system's organization. For example, the input to the most peripheral stages of vision and motor control must be specified in terms of anatomically projected patterns (of light or muscular activity); thus, independence of structure and function is less likely in systems requiring somatotopic input or output specification. In these cases, an anatomically distributed structure may reasonably reflect a distributed functional architecture. However, when investigating abstract cognitive processes like reasoning, there is no reason to expect isomorphisms between structure and function, as demonstrated by the computer analogy.\\n\\nPerhaps this is too obvious to warrant mention. Yet, the commitment to 'brain-style' modeling often leads to characteristic connectionist claims about psychology, driven by the implicit—and unwarranted—assumption that structural similarities should exist across different levels of a computational system. This is concerning because much of the psychology resulting from this search for structural analogies is notably regressive. For instance, the notion that the brain is a neural network revives a largely discredited associationist psychology. Similarly, the idea of anatomically distributed brain activity leads to functionally distributed representations for concepts, which in turn leads to the postulation of micro-features; yet, the inadequacies of feature-based theories of concepts are well-documented, and microfeature theory has not addressed them (see Bolinger, 1965; J.D. Fodor, 1977). Additionally, the idea that the strength of neuronal connections is influenced by co-activation frequency is projected onto the cognitive level, resulting in a resurgence of statistical learning models that have been widely recognized as limited in applicability (e.g., Chomsky, 1957; Minsky and Papert, 1972).\\n\\nWhile, in principle, knowledge of brain function could beneficially guide cognitive modeling, a research strategy must be judged by its outcomes. The primary outcome of 'brain-style' modeling has been the revival of psychological theories whose limitations were previously well-understood. This has occurred largely because assumptions about brain structure have been too directly adopted as hypotheses about cognitive architecture. It is an instructive paradox that the current effort to be thoroughly modern and 'take the brain seriously' has led to a psychology indistinguishable from the worst of Hume and Berkeley. The moral seems to be that one should be deeply skeptical of the ambitious brain modeling that claims to address cognitive problems. While we understand the desire for biologically respectable theories that many psychologists feel, truth should take precedence over respectability.\",\n"," \"**5.6 Concluding Comments: Connectionism as a Theory of Implementation**\\n\\nThroughout our discussion, a recurring theme has been that many arguments supporting connectionism are best understood as suggesting that cognitive architecture is implemented through a specific type of network composed of abstract 'units.' Viewed in this light, these arguments remain neutral regarding the actual nature of cognitive architecture. In these concluding remarks, we will briefly examine connectionism from this perspective.\\n\\nStudents entering courses on computational or information-processing models of cognition often harbor misconceptions about the role of physical computers in these models. They are typically skeptical of 'the computer as a model of cognition,' citing reasons such as 'computers don't forget or make mistakes,' 'computers operate through exhaustive search,' 'computers are too logical and lack motivation,' 'computers can't learn independently and only follow instructions,' or 'computers are either too fast or too slow,' and 'computers never experience fatigue or boredom.' Adding more sophisticated critiques like 'computers don't exhibit graceful degradation' or 'computers are too sensitive to physical damage' makes this list resemble the arguments put forth by connectionists.\\n\\nThe response to these criticisms has always been that the implementation and properties associated with a specific realization of an algorithm are irrelevant to the psychological theory. Only the algorithm and the representations it operates on are intended as psychological hypotheses. Students are introduced to the concept of a 'virtual machine' and shown that some virtual machines can learn, forget, become bored, make mistakes, and exhibit other behaviors, provided there is a theory explaining the origins of each empirical phenomenon.\\n\\nGiven this clear distinction between a model and its implementation, a theorist impressed by the virtues of connectionism can propose Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models as theories of implementation. However, these models, in principle, remain neutral about the nature of cognitive processes, far from providing a revolutionary new basis for cognitive science. They might even be seen as advancing the goals of classical information-processing psychology by attempting to explain how the brain, or an idealized brain-like network, might realize the processes hypothesized by conventional cognitive science.\\n\\nConnectionists sometimes explicitly regard their models as theories of implementation. Ballard (1986) refers to connectionism as 'the implementational approach.' Touretzky (1986) views his BoltzCONS model in this way, using connectionist techniques to implement conventional symbol-processing mechanisms like pushdown stacks and other LISP facilities.\\n\\nRumelhart and McClelland (1986b, p. 117), who believe connectionism represents a radical departure from the conventional symbol-processing approach, nonetheless refer to 'PDP implementations' of various mechanisms such as attention. Later in the same essay, they clarify their position: unlike 'reductionists,' they believe 'new and useful concepts emerge at different levels of organization' (1986b, p. 128). Although they defend the idea that higher levels should be understood through the study of interactions among lower-level units, the notion of autonomous levels seems implicit throughout the essay.\\n\\nOnce it is acknowledged that cognitive-level principles are distinct from the architectural principles that connectionism articulates, there seems little left to debate. It is pointless to argue whether cognitive science should focus on 'the interaction of lower levels' or on processes at the cognitive level since both are necessary. Some scientists study geological principles, while others examine 'the interaction of lower-level units' like molecules. However, since the existence of genuine, autonomously stateable principles of geology is undisputed, those who build molecular-level models do not claim to have invented a 'new theory of geology' that dismisses traditional 'folk geological' concepts like rocks, rivers, and mountains.\\n\\nIn summary, we have no objection to networks as potential implementation models, nor do we believe that any of our arguments are incompatible with this proposal. The issue, however, is that if connectionists wish their models to be viewed this way, they must significantly change their approach. It is evident that most connectionist models proposed thus far must be construed as theories of cognition, not implementation. This is because these theories inherently ascribe representational content to the units or aggregates they propose. As we noted at the outset, a theory of the relationships among representational states is inherently a cognitive theory, not an implementation theory. Our argument has been that when viewed as a cognitive theory rather than an implementation theory, connectionism appears to have significant limitations. The problem with connectionist models is that the reasons for believing they might be true are also reasons for doubting their validity as psychological theories.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{1.1 The True Commitment of Connectionism: PTC Version}\\n\\nIn this chapter, I adopt a perspective on connectionism that was elaborated in Chapter 2 and in Smolensky's 1988 work, which I refer to as PTC (Proper Treatment of Connectionism). To simplify, PTC posits that connectionism is fundamentally committed to a broad formalism for describing mental representations and processes. The Classical view, by contrast, holds that mental representations are elements of a symbolic system and that mental processes involve symbol manipulation. PTC, however, suggests that mental representations are vectors that partially define the state of a dynamical system (the activities within a connectionist network), and that mental processes are governed by the differential equations dictating the evolution of this system.\\n\\nThe key point is this: influenced by the Classical view, the study of computation and cognition has predominantly relied on discrete mathematics. In contrast, the connectionist approach integrates the study of computation and cognition with continuous mathematics. According to PTC, the true commitment is to uncover the insights into computation and cognition that continuous mathematics can offer.\\n\\nFrom the PTC perspective, simple associationism represents a limited and ineffective aspect of the connectionist framework. While some may be drawn to connectionism due to its associationist elements, it is a mistake to assume that connectionism is solely committed to these principles. Equating connectionism with simple associationism is as misguided as equating Classical symbolic theory with Aristotelian logic. Despite any temptations Fodor may present, I do not endorse either comparison.\\n\\nIn fact, the analogy with Aristotle is somewhat fitting. Our current grasp of connectionist computation's potential might be likened to Aristotle's understanding of symbolic computation. Before connectionists can make significant strides in cognitive modeling, we likely have as much development ahead as symbolic computation did from Aristotle to Turing. By shifting from symbolic computation to connectionist modeling, we have taken on a substantial challenge, focusing more on resolving foundational issues within connectionism than on addressing cognitive problems. In my view, this challenge is worthwhile for the goal of understanding how symbolic computation, or its approximations, can emerge from numerical computation in dynamical systems that share the general characteristics of neural computation.\\n\\nGiven the extensive progress needed in developing connectionist computational techniques for cognitive modeling, I will not argue for the superiority or even the plausibility of a connectionist approach. Instead, I advocate for allowing connectionism to advance without the misconception, significantly propagated by Fodor and Pylyshyn (Chapter 3; henceforth, F&P), that pursuing the connectionist approach is futile due to fundamental flaws.\\n\\nWith this understanding of the commitments of Classical and connectionist approaches, F&P's claim that any cognitive architecture incorporating structured mental representations and processes sensitive to that structure is inherently classical, stretches the concept of 'classical architecture' beyond reasonable limits.\",\n"," '**1.2 Implementation vs. Refinement**\\n\\nThe core argument of Fodor and Pylyshyn (F&P) can be summarized as follows: \"Standard connectionism is merely simple associationism cloaked in new terminology, and as such, it is fundamentally flawed. Connectionists should instead pursue a nonstandard connectionism that embraces the principles of compositionality and structure-sensitive processing. They should adopt the Classical view and design their networks to be implementations of classical architectures.\" This perspective assumes that connectionist models with compositionally structured representations must inherently be implementations of a classical architecture. My primary aim is to demonstrate that this assumption is incorrect. The connectionist systems I advocate propose models that are not implementations but rather refinements of the Classical symbolic approach. These connectionist models suggest a genuinely different cognitive architecture, with the classical architecture serving as a scientifically significant approximation. Some may suspect that distinguishing between \"implementation\" and \"refinement\" is merely splitting hairs and lacks philosophical significance. However, the new cognitive architecture I propose lacks the most crucial property of Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s classical architecture: mental representations and processes are not supported by the same formal entities—there are no \"symbols\" that fulfill both roles. This new cognitive architecture is fundamentally two-tiered: formal, algorithmic specification of processing mechanisms on one level, and semantic interpretation on another, requiring two distinct levels of description.\\n\\nIn cognitive science, the term \"implementation\" has been inherited from computer science, and I suggest we adhere to this definition. If there is an account of a computational system at one level and another at a lower level, the lower one is an implementation of the higher one only if the higher description provides a complete, precise, algorithmic account of the system\\'s behavior. It is insufficient for the higher-level account to offer a rough summary of interactions at the lower level or for the lower-level account to involve some of the same basic ideas for solving the problem (e.g., decomposing the problem into subproblems). Such weak uses of \"implementation\" are prevalent in the literature, especially in attempts to dismiss connectionism as \"mere implementation.\" However, in its correct usage, implementation requires that the higher-level account provide an exact, precise, algorithmic account of the system\\'s behavior.\\n\\nIt is crucial to understand that without adopting this definition of implementation, it is impossible to legitimately argue for F&P\\'s ultimate conclusion: as long as connectionists are engaged in implementation, they will not provide a new cognitive architecture. If it is only shown that connectionism \"implements\" the classical architecture under a looser definition, the conclusion is that the Classical account offers a rough, higher-level approximation to the connectionist account or shares some basic ideas about information representation and processing. This is a much weaker conclusion than what F&P seek. They desire the conclusion that only true implementation will support: since the Classical account provides a complete, precise, algorithmic account of the cognitive system, there is no need to resort to the lower-level account as long as the phenomena of interest are observable at the higher level. Of course, it is precisely those phenomena that classicists will consider \"truly cognitive.\" To account for intrinsically lower-level phenomena—such as neural phenomena and possibly certain perceptual/motor phenomena—the classicist will acknowledge the need to address a lower-level account. However, within the domain of \"pure cognition,\" classicists will not need to delve into such details. These are the conclusions classicists have advocated for decades based on analogies to higher- and lower-level computer languages. However, these languages, by design, satisfy the correct definition of implementation; none of these conclusions follow from weaker definitions, nor do they follow from the connectionist position I defend here. Contrary to the conclusion that \"nothing can be gained from going to the lower-level account,\" there is much to be gained: completeness, precision, and algorithmic accounts of processing, none of which are generally available at the higher level, according to PTC.\\n\\nTo illustrate how the distributed connectionist architecture fundamentally differs from the classical one—and fails to provide an \"implementation\" using the correct definition—I will outline how the connectionist architecture is intrinsically divided over two levels of description. We will consider the purest case: distributed connectionist models with the following two properties:\\n\\n1. (a) Interpretation can be assigned to large-scale activity patterns but not to individual units.\\n   (b) The dynamics governing the interaction of individual units are sufficiently complex that the algorithm defining these interactions cannot be translated into a tractably specified algorithm for the interaction of whole patterns.\\n\\nAs a result of these two properties, we observe two levels of analysis with distinct characteristics. At the lower level, where the state variables are the activities of individual units, processing is described by a complete, precise, and formal algorithm, but semantic interpretation is not possible. At the higher level, where the system\\'s state is described in terms of certain large-scale patterns, semantic interpretation is feasible, but complete, precise algorithms for processing cannot be stated. As characterized in Chapter 2, the syntax or processing algorithm resides strictly at the lower level, while the semantics reside strictly at the upper level. Since both syntax and semantics are essential to the cognitive architecture, we have an intrinsically split-level cognitive architecture: there is no account of the architecture in which the same elements carry both syntax and semantics. Thus, we have a fundamentally new candidate for cognitive architecture that is not an implementation of the classical one.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the conclusions of this section rely heavily on the assumption (1a) that connectionist representations are distributed (when viewed at the level of individual units, where processing algorithms can be identified (1b)). While F&P attempt to portray the issue of local vs. distributed representations as a minor technical dispute among connectionists with no philosophical consequence, I believe this to be a significant error. Distributed representations, when combined with (1b), imply that in the connectionist cognitive architecture, mental representations have a fundamentally different relationship to mental processes than in the Classical account. I will revisit this crucial point in section 3.',\n"," '\\\\subsection*{2.1 The Ultra-Local Case}\\n\\nHere is a brief overview of what I consider to be the central argument of Fodor and Pylyshyn (F&P).\\n\\n(2) (a) Thoughts possess a composite structure.\\n\\nBy this, they mean that thoughts, such as \"John loves the girl,\" are not atomic; they are composite mental states constructed from thoughts about \"John,\" \"loves,\" and \"the girl.\"\\n\\n(2) (b) Mental processes are sensitive to this composite structure.\\n\\nFor example, from any thought of the form $p \\\\& q$—regardless of what $p$ and $q$ are—we can deduce $p$.\\n\\nF&P elevate (2) to define the Classical view of cognition and claim that this view is challenged by connectionism. I argue that this is incorrect, but for now, we will continue with F&P\\'s argument.\\n\\nHaving identified claims (2) as definitive of the Classical view, F&P argue that there are compelling reasons to support these claims. According to these arguments, mental states exhibit properties of productivity, systematicity, compositionality, and inferential coherence. Without delving into all these arguments, I am willing to accept that they are convincing enough to justify the conclusion that (2) must be taken seriously.\\n\\nNow, for F&P\\'s analysis of connectionism. They assert that in (standard) connectionism, all representations are atomic; mental states lack composite structure, violating (2a). Furthermore, they claim that (standard) connectionist processing is associative and sensitive only to statistics, not to structure—violating (2b). Therefore, they conclude that (standard) connectionism is maximally non-Classical, as it violates both defining principles. Consequently, connectionism is defeated by the compelling arguments in favor of the Classical view.\\n\\nWhy do F&P claim that connectionist representations are atomic? Their figure 3.2 (in chapter 3, p. 100) illustrates this point, rendered here as figure 4.1. This network is supposed to represent the standard view. It is true that Ballard and Hayes wrote a paper (Ballard and Hayes, 1984; also Ballard, 1986) about using connectionist networks for automated resolution theorem proving, where networks like this appear. However, it is a serious mistake to view this as the paradigmatic connectionist account for human inferences of this sort. The ultra-local connectionist representation, where entire propositions are represented by individual nodes, is far from typical of connectionist models and should not be considered definitive of the connectionist approach.\\n\\nA central claim in my response to F&P is that any critique of the connectionist approach must consider the consequences of using distributed representations, where high-level conceptual entities such as propositions are distributed over many nodes, and the same nodes simultaneously participate in the representation of many entities. Their response, in section 2.1.3 (p. 103), is as follows: The distributed/local representation issue concerns (they assume) whether each node in figure 4.1 refers to something complex and lower level (the distributed case) or not (the local case). But, they claim, this issue is irrelevant because it pertains to a between-level issue, while the compositionality of mental states is a within-level issue.\\n\\nMy response is that they are correct that compositionality is a within-level issue and that the distributed/local distinction is a between-level issue. Their argument presumes that because of this difference, one issue cannot influence the other. But that is a fallacy. It assumes that the between-level relation in distributed representations cannot affect the within-level structure of the relationships between the representations of $A \\\\& B$ and the representation of $A$. This is simply false. There are profound implications of distributed representations for compositionality; these are the subject of all of section 2 of this chapter. In particular, it will turn out that figure 4.1 is as relevant to a distributed connectionist account of inference as it is to a symbolic account. In the ultra-local case, figure 4.1 is relevant, and their critique stands; in the distributed case, figure 4.1 is a mischaracterization of the connectionist account, and their critique completely misses its target. It will further turn out that a valid analysis of the actual distributed case, based on suggestions by Pylyshyn himself, leads to the opposite conclusion: connectionist models using distributed representations describe mental states with a relevant kind of (within-level) constituent structure. The rather weak sense of constituent structure in generic distributed representations, identified in section 2.2, will be significantly strengthened in explicitly designed distributed representations, discussed in section 2.3, where constituents can fill varying structural roles.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{2.2 The Distributed (Weakly Compositional) Case}\\n\\nThe objective here is to demonstrate that generic connectionist models utilizing distributed representations can attribute to mental states the kind of compositional structure required by (2a), contrary to F\\\\&P's conclusion based on the ultra-local network depicted in Figure 4.1.\\n\\n2.2.1 The Coffee Story\\n\\nMy argument primarily involves an analysis suggested by Zenon Pylyshyn at the 1984 Cognitive Science Meeting in Boulder. We will take a distributed representation of a cup with coffee, subtract from it a distributed representation of a cup without coffee, and refer to the remainder, following Pylyshyn, as 'the connectionist representation of coffee.'\\n\\nTo generate these distributed representations, I will use a set of 'micro-features' (Hinton et al., 1986) that are not particularly micro, as is often the case in examples designed to be intuitively understandable in a non-technical exposition. These micro-features are illustrated in Figure 4.2.\\n\\nFigure 4.2 shows a distributed representation of a cup with coffee: a pattern of activity where the active units (black) correspond to micro-features present in the description of a cup containing coffee. This is a crude, nearly sensory-level representation, but it aids in making the example more intuitive, though it is not essential.\\n\\nGiven the representation of a cup with coffee displayed in Figure 4.2, Pylyshyn suggests subtracting the representation of a cup without coffee. The representation of a cup without coffee is shown in Figure 4.3, and Figure 4.4 illustrates the result of this subtraction.\\n\\nWhat does this procedure yield as 'the connectionist representation of coffee'? From Figure 4.4, we derive a burnt odor and hot brown liquid with curved sides and bottom surfaces contacting porcelain. This is indeed a representation of coffee, but in a very specific context: the context provided by the cup.\\n\\nWhat does this imply for Pylyshyn's conclusion that 'the connectionist representation of a cup with coffee is merely the representation of a cup without coffee combined with the representation of coffee'? What is involved in recombining the representations of Figures 4.3 and 4.4 to form that of Figure 4.2? We construct the representation of a cup with coffee from a representation of a cup and a representation of coffee, but it is a rather unusual combination. There is also the representation of the interaction between the cup and coffee—such as brown liquid contacting porcelain. Thus, the composite representation is built from coffee extracted from the situation of a cup with coffee, combined with the cup extracted from the same situation, along with their interaction.\\n\\nTherefore, the compositional structure exists, but in an approximate sense. It is not equivalent to taking a context-independent representation of coffee and a context-independent representation of a cup—and certainly not equivalent to taking a context-independent representation of the relationship in or with—and combining them into a symbolic structure, concatenating them to form the kind of syntactic compositional structures like with (CUP, COFFEE) that F\\\\&P want connectionist networks to implement.\\n\\nTo further illustrate this point, let's reconsider the representation of coffee once the cup has been subtracted. This, Pylyshyn suggests, is the connectionist representation of coffee. However, as we have already noted, this is truly a representation of coffee in the specific context of being inside a cup. According to Pylyshyn's formula, it should have been possible, in principle, to take the connectionist representation of a can with coffee and subtract from it the connectionist representation of a can without coffee. What would happen if we actually did this? We would obtain a representation of ground, brown, burnt-smelling granules stacked in a cylindrical shape, along with granules contacting tin. This is the connectionist representation of coffee we derive by starting with a can with coffee instead of a cup with coffee. Alternatively, we could start with the representation of a tree with coffee and subtract the tree without coffee. We would obtain a connectionist representation of coffee as brown beans in an unusual shape hanging suspended in mid-air. Or again, we could start with a man with coffee and derive yet another connectionist representation of coffee: one quite similar to the entire representation of a cup with coffee from which we extracted our initial representation of coffee.\\n\\nThe point is that the representation of coffee obtained from the construction starting with a cup with coffee leads to a different representation of coffee than those derived from other constructions with equivalent a priori status. This means that if you wish to discuss the connectionist representation of coffee in this distributed scheme, you must refer to a family of distributed activity patterns. What unites all these particular representations of coffee is nothing other than a type of family resemblance.\",\n"," '**2.2.2 Morals of the Coffee Story**\\n\\nThe first lesson from the coffee story is that, unlike the ultra-local scenario depicted in Figure 4.1, distributed representations involve complex representations composed of constituent representations. This constituency relation is a within-level relation, as required by F&P. The pattern or vector representing \"cup with coffee\" is made up of a vector representing \"cup without coffee\" combined with a vector representing \"coffee.\" When characterizing the constituent vectors of the composite vector, we are not concerned with the fact that the vector representing \"cup with coffee\" is composed of the activity of individual micro-feature units. The relation between the vector and its individual numerical elements is not the constituency relation, making section 2.1.4 (pp. 103-11) of F&P irrelevant, as it addresses a mistake not present here.\\n\\nThe second lesson is that the constituency relation among distributed representations is crucial for analyzing connectionist models and explaining their behavior, but it is not part of the information-processing mechanism within the connectionist model. To process the vector representing \"cup with coffee,\" the network does not need to decompose it into constituents. For processing, the between-level relation, not the within-level relation, is what matters. The processing of the vector is determined by the individual numerical activities that make up the vector. Thus, the arbitrary definition of the constituents of \"cup with coffee\" introduces no ambiguities in how the network processes that representation—ambiguities exist only for us as analysts. Any definition of constituency that provides explanatory leverage is valid; lack of uniqueness is not an issue.\\n\\nThe third lesson is that the decomposition of composite states into their constituents is not precise or uniquely defined. While the notion of constituency is important, attempts to formalize it will likely involve approximation. As discussed in Chapter 2, this is typical: symbolic computation notions provide tools for constructing higher-level accounts of connectionist models using distributed representation, but these notions offer approximate, not precise, accounts.\\n\\nThe fourth lesson is that while connectionist networks using distributed representations describe mental states with the type of constituency required by (2a), they do not provide a correctly defined implementation of a symbolic language of thought. The context-dependency of the constituents, the interactions when combined, the inability to uniquely and precisely identify constituents, and the notion that the representation of coffee is a collection of vectors knit together by family resemblance—all these factors mean that the relation between connectionist and syntactic-symbolic constituency is not one of implementation. It would be absurd to claim that even if the connectionist story is correct, it would have no implications for cognitive architecture, merely filling in lower-level details without affecting the higher-level account.\\n\\nThese conclusions address compositional representation (2a) without explicitly addressing structure-sensitive processing (2b). Addressing structure sensitivity to the depth necessary for real cognitive modeling is beyond this chapter\\'s scope and, to a large extent, beyond current connectionism. However, the fundamental hypothesis of PTC is that the mind is a statistics-sensitive engine operating on structure-sensitive (numerical) representations. The previous arguments have shown that distributed representations possess constituency relations and can encode structure. Extending this to address the complexity of rich structures in complex cognitive processes is the topic of the next section. Here, it suffices to note that once complex structured information is represented in distributed numerical patterns, statistics-sensitive processes can analyze statistical regularities in a fully structure-sensitive way. Whether such processes can provide adequate structure sensitivity for linguistic and inferential processing remains unknown.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distributed models can satisfy (2). Whether (2) can be satisfied to the depth required by cognitive modeling is an open empirical question, just as it is for the symbolic approach. At the same time, distributed connectionist models do not implement the symbolic instantiations of (2) that F&P are committed to.\\n\\nBefore summing up, let\\'s return to Figure 4.1. In what sense does Figure 4.1 describe the relation between the distributed representation of $A \\\\mathcal{E} B$ and the distributed representations of $A$ and $B$? The coffee story intended to show that the distributed representations of the constituents are, in an approximate but explanation-relevant sense, part of the composite representation. Thus, in the distributed case, the relation between the node labeled $A \\\\mathcal{E} B$ and the others is a kind of whole/part relation. An inference mechanism that takes the vector representing $A \\\\subseteq B$ as input and produces the vector representing $A$ as output extracts a part from a whole. In this sense, it is no different from a symbolic inference mechanism that takes the syntactic structure A & B and extracts the syntactic constituent $\\\\mathbf{A}$. The connectionist mechanisms for doing this differ from symbolic mechanisms, and the approximate nature of the whole/part relation gives connectionist computation different characteristics: it is not simply a new implementation of the old computation.\\n\\nIt is clear that, just as Figure 4.1 offers a crude summary of the symbolic process of passing from $\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\& \\\\mathbf{B}$ to $\\\\mathbf{A}$, using labels to encode hidden internal structures within the nodes, the same is true for the distributed connectionist case. In both cases, the links in Figure 4.1 are crude summaries of complex processes, not simple causal channels passing activity from the top node to the lower nodes. Such a simple causal story applies only to the ultra-local connectionist case, the only legitimate target of F&P\\'s critique.\\n\\nTo be clear, there is no serious distributed connectionist model, as far as I know, of the kind of formal inference F&P have in mind. Many proponents of connectionism would argue that formal inference is a specially trained, poorly practiced skill far from central to cognition, and thus we can afford to delay providing a connectionist model of it. I prefer to say that the F&P argument concerns an important issue: the constituent structure of mental states; formal inference is just one setting to see the importance of that structure. So, the preceding discussion of the constituent structure of distributed representations addresses the heart of their critique, even if a well-developed connectionist account of formal inference remains unavailable.',\n"," '**2.3 The Distributed (Strongly Compositional) Case**\\n\\nOne might argue that the vector encoding the distributed representation of \"cup with coffee\" has constituent vectors representing \"cup\" and \"coffee,\" but this representation is too weak for all uses of constituent structure, particularly for supporting formal inference. This is because the vector representing \"cup\" cannot fill multiple structural roles. A true constituent can move around and fill various roles in different structures. Can vectors encoding distributed representations achieve this without merely implementing symbolic syntactic constituency? This section aims to describe research showing that the answer is affirmative.\\n\\nA large class of connectionist representations, termed tensor product representations, is defined and analyzed in Smolensky (1987a) and applied in Dolan and Smolensky (1988). Various members of this class are generated by specifying several parameters in a general method for creating connectionist representations of structured information. The resulting parametric variation in the representations is broad, encompassing simple representations like the case of figure I, as well as representations close to true implementations of a syntactic language of thought. This class covers the spectrum from fully distributed to ultra-local representations and includes representations with a full sense of constituency, where role-independent constituents are assigned to roles in a structure, and the representation of the structure is systematically built from the representation of the constituents.\\n\\nThe problem motivating this work is mapping complex structures, such as parse trees, into vectors of activity in connectionist networks, ensuring that the constituent structure is available for connectionist processing. A general formal framework for this problem assumes a set of discrete structures \\\\(S\\\\) (like parse trees) and a vector space \\\\(V\\\\) — a space of activity states of a connectionist network. A connectionist representation is a mapping from \\\\(S\\\\) to \\\\(V\\\\); the theorist\\'s job is to identify mappings with desirable properties. Tensor product representations can provide many of these properties.\\n\\nA particular tensor product representation is constructed in two steps:\\n1. Specify a decompositional process where discrete structures are explicitly broken down into a set of constituents, each filling a particular role in the structure. This step is not inherently connectionist; it specifies the kind of constituent structure to represent.\\n2. Specify two connectionist representations: one for the structural roles and another for their fillers (the constituents). For every filler, assign a vector in the state space of a network for representing fillers; similarly, assign a vector for every role in the state space of a network for representing roles.\\n\\nThese steps indicate the \\'parameters\\' in the general tensor product representational scheme that must be specified to individuate a particular representation. Once specified, two simple operations from vector space theory generate the representation of a particular discrete structure. The representation of the whole is built from its constituent parts by superposition, which is vector addition: the vector representing the whole is the sum of the vectors representing the parts. Step 1 specifies the constituents involved in this process. The vector representing a given constituent is a role-sensitive representation: a representation of that constituent in its role in the whole. This vector is built by taking a particular vector product of the vector representing the constituent independent of any role and the vector representing the role in the structure filled by the constituent. Step 2 specifies vectors representing individual structural roles and vectors representing individual fillers for those roles independently of any role. The product operation here is a vector operation called the tensor product, which takes two vectors and produces a new vector; if the two vectors consist of \\\\(n\\\\) and \\\\(m\\\\) activity values, their tensor product is a vector of \\\\(nm\\\\) activity values, each being a different product (using ordinary numerical multiplication) of two activity values, one from each original vector.\\n\\nThe tensor product provides a general solution to a long-standing problem in distributed connectionist representation: the variable binding problem. How can we take an activity pattern representing a variable and another pattern representing a value and generate a connectionist representation of their binding with the right computational properties? The simplicity of the tensor product shows it satisfies the computational demands of (distributed) connectionist variable binding. The tensor product technique generalizes specific tricks (especially conjunctive coding: Hinton et al., 1986; McClelland and Kawamoto, 1986; Smolensky, forthcoming) used to solve this problem in particular instances.\\n\\nThe tensor product representation of constituent structure strengthens the notion of constituency discussed in the previous section through the coffee story. There, the whole/part relation between \"cup with coffee\" and \"coffee\" mirrored a whole/part relation between their respective representations: the latter relation was not between molecular symbolic structures and their atomic constituents, as in a symbolic language of thought, but between a sum vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\) and the component vectors that add up to it: \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\mathbf{c}_1 + \\\\mathbf{c}_2 + \\\\ldots\\\\). The same is true here with tensor product representations, but now we can identify the representations of each constituent as a role-dependent representation built systematically (through tensor product variable binding) from a role-independent representation of the filler and a filler-independent representation of its role.\\n\\nAmong the computational properties required of the variable binding mechanism is the possibility of unbinding: from the role-dependent representation of a constituent, we must extract the role-independent representation of that constituent. Similarly, given the vector representing a symbolic structure as a whole, it should be possible to extract the role-independent representation of the filler of any given role in the structure. Under various conditions, this is possible with the tensor product representation, although when many roles are simultaneously filled, exceeding the network\\'s capacity, corruptions, confusions, and errors can occur during unbinding. The conditions for error-free unbinding and characterization of errors when these conditions are violated can be computed (Smolensky, 1987a). For example, if we have a tensor product representation for \\\\(P \\\\mathcal{E} Q\\\\) and wish to extract the first element \\\\(P\\\\) as part of a deductive process, then as long as the representing network is not trivially small, we can do so without error using simple (linear) connectionist processes.\\n\\nReturning to F&P\\'s critique, let\\'s see what the tensor product representational scheme can do for us regarding the simple inference problems they discuss.\\n\\nUsing the tensor product technique, it is possible to define a family of representations of tree structures. Consider a simple tree for \\\\(P \\\\mathcal{E} Q\\\\) with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\) at the top, \\\\(P\\\\) as its left child, and \\\\(Q\\\\) as its right child; view the roles as positions in the tree, the simplest kind of role decomposition. The tensor product representation of that tree structure is a vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{F}(P \\\\mathcal{E} Q)\\\\) related to the vectors representing the constituents, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{F}(P)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{F}(Q)\\\\), by a function \\\\(\\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\&}\\\\) specific to constructing conjunctions:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathbf{F}(P \\\\mathcal{G} Q) = \\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\&}[\\\\mathbf{F}(P), \\\\mathbf{F}(Q)]\\n\\\\]\\nThe function \\\\(B_{\\\\mathcal{E}}\\\\) is defined by \\\\(\\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\&}(\\\\mathbf{u}, \\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{c}_{\\\\&} + \\\\tau_{0} \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\tau_{1} \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathbf{c}_{\\\\&}\\\\) is a constant vector, and \\\\(\\\\tau_{0}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\tau_{1}\\\\) are linear operators (the most natural vector operators) that vary depending on how the parameters individuating the tensor product representation are chosen.\\n\\nI have detailed this and used this notation because, in note 9 of F&P (chapter 2, p. 152), exactly this property is chosen to define \\\\(\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\) as a \\'physical instantiation mapping of combinatorial structure.\\' In this sense, the tensor product representation meets F&P\\'s formal requirements for a representation of combinatorial structure.\\n\\nBut have we merely provided an implementation of a symbolic language of thought? Generally, the answer is \\'no.\\' Depending on how we set the parameters in specifying the tensor product representation (which determines the properties of \\\\(\\\\tau_{0}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\tau_{1}\\\\)), we can fail to have any of the following properties holding (Smolensky, 1987a):\\n1. Uniqueness with respect to roles or fillers. If we\\'re not careful, even though the above equation is satisfied, we can end up with \\\\(P E Q\\\\) having the same representation as \\\\(Q E P\\\\), or other subtle ambiguities about what fills various roles in the structure.\\n2. Unbounded depth. We may avoid the first problem for small structures, but when representing large or deep structures, these problems may appear. Unless the vector space for our representation is infinite-dimensional (corresponding to a network with infinitely many units), we cannot solve the first problem for unbounded depth. (The same is true of Turing/von Neumann machines if they are only allowed bounded resources; but whereas the capacity limit in the symbolic case is hard, the tensor product representation allows for graceful degradation as resources are saturated.)\\n3. Non-confusability in memory. Even when the first problem is avoided, with representations having uniquely determined filler/role bindings, it can easily happen that we cannot simultaneously store many such structures in a connectionist memory without undesired memory intrusions during retrieval.\\n4. Processing independence. This generalizes the preceding point, concerning processing constraints that may arise even when the first problem is avoided. In simple associative processing, for example, we may find that we can associate two vectors representing symbolic structures with what we like, but then find ourselves unable to associate the representation of a third structure with what we like, because its associate is constrained by the other two.\\n\\nWith all these properties potentially failing to hold, it doesn\\'t seem like we\\'re dealing with an implementation of a symbolic language of thought. But at this point, someone might say, \\'Well, you\\'ve just got a lousy implementation of a symbolic language of thought.\\' But it\\'s not that simple. We may have lost some (superficially desirable, at least) features of a symbolic language of thought, but we\\'ve gained some (superficially desirable, at least) features of connectionist processing in return:\\n1. Massive parallelism. Since we have a vector representing an entire tree at once, we can feed it into the usual connectionist massively parallel processes. Unlike traditional AI programs, we don\\'t have to spend all our time painfully traversing step-by-step long descending chains into the bowels of complex symbolic data structures: it\\'s all there at once, all accessible in parallel.\\n2. Content-addressable memory. This is the usual distributed connectionist story, but now it applies to structural information.\\n3. Statistical inference. F&P are among the first to attack connectionism for basing its processing mechanisms on statistical inference. One more reason for them to deny that the connectionist framework I am discussing truly constitutes an implementation of their preferred architecture. Yet their arguments against statistical processing are much less compelling than their arguments for structure-sensitive processing. We are now in a position to pursue both in a unified framework, dissolving a long-standing tension arising from a failure to see how to formally unify structure-sensitive and statistical processing. Rather than modeling the mind as either a structure cruncher or a number cruncher, we can now see it as a number cruncher where the numbers crunched represent complex structures.\\n4. Statistical learning. Since structure can now be fully integrated into connectionist learning research, we can move from declarations of dogma to actual empirical results about what structurally rich representations and processes can and cannot be acquired from experience through statistically based learning. We can foresee a time when it will be too late to bet on the fate of the \\'poverty of the stimulus\\' dogma.\\n\\nThe point is that the parametric variation in tensor product representations covers a rich territory, and an important item on the connectionist cognitive modeling agenda is to determine whether in that territory there is a set of representations with the right mixture of the power of the benefits and the limitations of the drawbacks to capture real human behavior. This large space of tensor product representations extends from simple ultra-local representations, which F&P correctly dismiss, towards—though not quite reaching—a true implementation of a symbolic language of thought. If you want such an implementation, you must go to a limit that includes the following characteristics:\\n1. Orthogonality. The angle between the vectors representing different roles needs to be 90 degrees, and similarly for vectors representing the fillers, to eliminate non-uniqueness and minimize interference in memory.\\n2. Infinite-dimensional representations. Otherwise, we can\\'t represent unboundedly deep structures without confusion.\\n3. Simple operations. If we want an implementation of sequential algorithms, then in processing these representations, we insist that the vector equivalent of the primitive symbolic operations (like LISP\\'s car, cdr, and cons) are all that can be done in one time step: we don\\'t avail ourselves of the massively parallel operations otherwise available to us.\\n\\nI have mostly discussed representations and little about processing. If we are interested, as F&P are, in inferences such as from \\\\(P \\\\mathcal{E} Q\\\\) to \\\\(P\\\\), it turns out that with tensor product representations, this operation can be achieved by a simple linear transformation upon these representational vectors, the kind of transformation most natural in this category of representations. Not only can this structure-sensitive process be achieved by connectionist mechanisms on connectionist representations, but it can be achieved through the simplest of all connectionist operations: linear mapping. All in an architecture that fundamentally differs from the classical one; we have not implemented a symbolic language of thought.',\n"," '### 3.1 Methodological Implications of Implementationalism and Limitivism\\n\\nIt appears most plausible that symbolic descriptions will offer scientifically significant, approximate higher-level accounts of how ultimate connectionist cognitive models compute. However, these distributed connectionist models are unlikely to implement a symbolic language of thought under the relevant and correct definition of the term. The approximations involved require an acceptance of context-sensitive symbols and interactional components within compositional structures, as illustrated by the coffee example. If we are willing to accept these degrees of approximation, symbolic-level descriptions can be viewed as useful, approximate higher-level accounts of processing within a connectionist network.\\n\\nA key conclusion regarding the constituency issue is that Classical and connectionist approaches differ not in their acceptance of principles (2), but in how they formally instantiate them. To truly address the Classical/connectionist debate, one must delve into the specific formal instantiations they provide for the non-formal principles (2). Failing to do so misses much of the issue. In the Classical approach, principles (2) are formalized using syntactic structures for mental representations and symbol manipulation for mental processes. In the distributed connectionist approach, principles (2) are formalized using vectorial representations for mental representations, with a corresponding notion of compositionality, and numerical mental processes that derive their structure sensitivity from the differential treatment of vector parts corresponding to different structural roles.\\n\\nIn terms of research methodology, the agenda for connectionism should not be to develop a connectionist implementation of the symbolic language of thought. Instead, it should focus on developing formal analyses of vectorial representations of complex structures and operations on those structures that are sufficiently structure-sensitive to perform the required tasks. This is precisely the type of research that tensor product representations, for example, are being used to support.\\n\\nThe PTC position asserts that distributed representations describe mental states with semantically interpretable constituents, but there is no complete, precise formal account of the construction of composites or mental processes in general that can be stated solely in terms of context-independent, semantically interpretable constituents. On this account, there is a language of thought, but only approximately; it does not provide a basis for an exact formal account of mental structure or processes and cannot independently support a precise formal account of cognitive architecture.\\n\\nConstituency illustrates a central component of the general PTC approach to connectionism: the hypothesized relationship between connectionist models based on continuous mathematics and classical models based on discrete, symbolic computation. This relationship might be termed the cognitive correspondence principle: when powerful connectionist computational systems are appropriately analyzed at higher levels, elements of symbolic computation emerge as properties.\\n\\nFigure 4.5 schematically illustrates the cognitive correspondence principle. At the top are non-formal notions: central hypotheses that the principles of cognition consist of principles of memory, inference, compositionality, and constituent structure, among others. In the F&P argument, the relevant non-formal principles are their compositionality principles (2).\\n\\nThe non-formal principles at the top of Figure 4.5 have certain formalizations in the discrete mathematical category, shown one level down on the right branch. For example, memory is formalized as standard location-addressed memory or a more sophisticated related notion. Inference is formalized in the discrete category as logical inference, a specific form of symbol manipulation, and so on.\\n\\nThe PTC research agenda involves taking these cognitive principles and finding new ways to instantiate them in formal principles based on the continuous mathematics of dynamical systems, shown at the lowest level on the left branch of Figure 4.5. The concept of memory retrieval is reformalized in terms of the continuous evolution of a dynamical system towards a point attractor whose position in the state space represents the memory, naturally resulting in content-addressed memory instead of location-addressed memory. Memory storage becomes the modification of the system\\'s dynamics so that its attractors are located where the memories are intended to be, making the principles of memory storage even more distinct from their symbolic counterparts than those of memory retrieval. Reformalizing inference principles in the continuous formalism naturally leads to principles of statistical inference rather than logical inference, and so on.\\n\\nThe cognitive correspondence principle states that the general relationship between connectionist formal principles and symbolic formal principles—given that they are both instantiations of common non-formal notions and, ultimately, scientifically valid descriptions of the same cognitive system—is that a higher-level analysis of connectionist systems reveals a match, to some approximation, with the symbolic formalism. This relationship is indicated in Figure 4.5 by the dotted arrow.\\n\\nThis contrasts with an implementational view of connectionism, such as that advocated by F&P. As depicted in Figure 4.5, the implementational methodology proceeds from the top to the bottom not directly via the left branch, but indirectly via the right branch: connectionists should take the symbolic instantiations of the non-formal principles and find ways to implement them in connectionist networks.\\n\\nThe PTC methodology contrasts not only with the implementational approach but also with the eliminativist one. In terms of these methodological considerations, eliminativism has strong and weak forms. The weak form advocates taking the left branch of Figure 4.5 but ignoring symbolic formalizations altogether, believing that symbolic notions will confuse rather than enlighten our understanding of connectionist computation. The strong eliminativist position argues that even viewing the non-formal principles at the top of Figure 4.5 as a starting point for thinking about cognition is a mistake. It suggests pursuing a blind bottom-up strategy, taking low-level connectionist principles from neuroscience and seeing where they lead without being influenced by archaic pre-scientific notions like those at the top of Figure 4.5.\\n\\nIn rejecting both the implementationalist and eliminativist positions, PTC views connectionist accounts as significantly reducing and explaining symbolic accounts. Connectionist accounts refine symbolic accounts, reduce the degree of approximation required, enrich computational notions from the symbolic and discrete world, and fill them with notions of continuous computation. This is primarily achieved by descending to a lower level of analysis, exposing the hidden micro-structure in large-scale, discrete symbolic operations.\\n\\nI have termed the PTC position \"limitivism\" because it views connectionism as delimiting the domain D of validity of symbolic accounts and explaining the validity of the symbolic approximation through passage to the \\'Classical limit,\\' a general theoretical limit incorporating specifics described in (6), where connectionist accounts increasingly admit higher-level symbolic accounts, at least in the limited domain D. This limitivist position on the relationship between connectionism and symbolic theory is modeled after a relation frequently observed in the refinement of physical theories, such as the relationship between quantum and Newtonian mechanics.\\n\\nThe cognitive correspondence principle is named as such because I believe it plays a role in developing a micro-theory of cognition analogous to the role the quantum correspondence principle played in developing micro-theory in physics. This case from physics directly instantiates the structure of Figure 4.5. Certain fundamental physical principles arch over both classical and quantum formalisms: notions of space and time, associated invariance principles, principles of energy and momentum conservation, force laws, and so on. These principles at the top of Figure 4.5 are instantiated in particular ways in the Classical formalism, corresponding to the point one level down on the right branch. Developing a new formalism is required to go to a lower level of physical analysis. In this quantum formalism, the fundamental principles are reinstantiated at the bottom of the left branch. The Classical formalism can be viewed as a higher-level description of the same principles operating at the lower quantum level, represented by the dotted line in Figure 4.5. Of course, quantum mechanics does not implement classical mechanics: the accounts are intimately related, but classical mechanics provides an approximate, not exact, higher-level account. In a fundamental sense, quantum and classical theories are quite incompatible: according to the ontology of quantum mechanics, the ontology of classical mechanics is impossible to realize in this world. However, the classical ontology and accompanying principles are theoretically essential for at least two reasons: (a) to provide explanations (perhaps approximate ones) of a vast range of classical phenomena for which direct explanation from quantum principles is infeasible; and (b) historically, to provide the guidance necessary to discover quantum principles in the first place. Developing lower-level principles without considering higher-level principles for guidance, given the insights gained from those principles, would seem inadvisable. This pragmatic consideration motivates the cognitive correspondence principle and the PTC position it leads to.',\n"," '### 3.2 Constituency via Vector Decomposition, Explanatory Relevance, and Causal Efficacy\\n\\nIn this section, I aim to connect the earlier methodological discussions to the core technical aspects of this chapter. My goal is to demonstrate that if we adopt the perspective that the research agenda of distributed connectionism seeks to find formal methods within the continuous mathematics of dynamical systems to naturally and effectively embody key non-formal principles of computation and cognition, then the connectionist analysis of constituent structure I have outlined is not only plausible but also quite natural. This topic is pertinent because it has been suggested that my analysis, perhaps in an attempt to refute Fodor and Pylyshyn (F&P), has distorted the notion of constituency. Critics argue that vector superposition and tensor product binding are inappropriate for representing constituency.\\n\\nSimultaneously, I will address the central question: \"Is the way vector decomposition constitutes a constituency relation sufficient to make constituency explanatorily relevant or causally efficacious in addressing the systematicity of thought, the fundamental issue motivating F&P\\'s critique?\"\\n\\nTo begin, let\\'s consider the concept of decomposing a vector into a sum or superposition of component vectors: \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\mathbf{c}_1 + \\\\mathbf{c}_2 + \\\\ldots\\\\). This technique is commonly used to explain the behavior of dynamical systems, particularly effective for simple linear systems where the equations governing state variable interactions are linear (as in basic connectionist models). In such cases, the process is as follows:\\n\\nWe want to determine the system\\'s behavior starting from an initial state described by vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\). In the connectionist context, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\) characterizes the input, and we seek to understand the subsequent states the system will traverse, especially the final state that determines the output. First, we ask how the vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\) can be decomposed: \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\mathbf{c}_1 + \\\\mathbf{c}_2 + \\\\ldots\\\\), where the component vectors \\\\(\\\\mathbf{c}_i\\\\) align with specific directions determined by the system\\'s linear interaction equations. These directions, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{e}_i\\\\), are known as the \\'normal modes\\' of the system, and each \\\\(\\\\mathbf{c}_i = c_i \\\\mathbf{e}_i\\\\), where the coefficient \\\\(c_i\\\\) indicates the strength of the \\\\(i^{\\\\text{th}}\\\\) normal mode in the input \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\). Once the vector is decomposed into components along the normal modes, we can express the system\\'s state at any later time as the superposition of states arising from each normal mode independently. These normal modes are defined to allow us to describe their evolution over time. Thus, by knowing the system\\'s interaction equations, we can compute the normal modes and their temporal evolution, enabling us to explain how any state evolves over time by decomposing it into components along the normal modes. For examples of this technique applied to connectionist networks, see Smolensky (1986) and Anderson and Mozer (1981) regarding the categorization in J.A. Anderson\\'s \\'Brain-State-in-a-Box\\' model. Both analyses address quasi-linear networks, a class encompassing many connectionist systems where the core computation is linear, but some non-linearity is also significant.\\n\\nTo explain the system\\'s behavior, we typically decompose the state vector into components along the normal modes, which are conveniently related to the system\\'s specific dynamics. If the system\\'s self-interaction changes over time (as in learning connectionist networks), we may adjust our decomposition approach to explain behavior. There is no unique way to decompose a vector, meaning there are multiple ways to view an input vector as composed of constituents. However, normal mode decomposition often provides a good explanation for behavior over time. Other compositions may also be explanatorily relevant.\\n\\nThus, decomposing a connectionist state vector representing an input into components is a natural step to explain input processing. If the connections mediating vector processing for composite structures sensibly process the vector according to task demands, understanding and explaining network behavior regularities likely requires breaking the vector for the structure into constituent vectors and relating whole processing to part processing. The usefulness of this decomposition, as opposed to arbitrary decompositions into meaningless component vectors, stems from the connections embodying the process. Specific components are useful for specific connections. Generally, what distinguishes a useful decomposition for predicting behavior from others is its special relation to the system\\'s dynamics. To explain various aspects of system behavior (e.g., cognitive processes acting on a given input), we may need to exploit different decompositions.\\n\\nAre vector constituents in physical and connectionist systems causally efficacious? It seems not, as the real mechanism driving system behavior operates independently of our descriptive preference for vector decomposition. It is the numerical values comprising the vector (in connectionist systems, the individual activity values) that truly drive the machine.\\n\\nAs Fodor and Pylyshyn might agree, caution is needed when considering \\'causal efficacy,\\' even in the Classical case. When writing a LISP program, are the symbolic structures we use causally efficacious in the computer\\'s operation? In a sense, they are: although we typically view the \\'real\\' causes as physical and below the symbolic level, there is a complete and precise algorithmic (temporal) story to tell about the machine\\'s states at the symbolic level. Traditional computers (hardware and especially software) are designed to ensure this, which is a primary source of their power.\\n\\nThe hypothesis I attribute to distributed connectionism is that no comparable story exists at the symbolic level in human cognitive architecture: no algorithm in terms of semantically interpretable elements provides a precise formal algorithmic account of the system\\'s behavior over time. This contrasts with the Classical view, which I have emphasized. A good way to characterize the difference may be whether constituents in mental structures are causally efficacious in mental processing.\\n\\nCausal efficacy was not my goal in developing the tensor product representation; rather, the goal was to design connectionist systems that exhibit complex systematic behavior, such as in language processing, and to mathematically explain that systematicity. As examples from physics show, it is incorrect to claim that explaining systematicity through constituent structures requires those constituents to be causally efficacious. It is also incorrect (but more honest) to claim (as Fodor often does) that such an explanatory strategy, while not provably unique, is \\'the only game in town.\\' An alternative explanatory strategy has been effectively practiced in physics for centuries and can be applied in cognitive science. There are now at least two games in town, and rather than pretending otherwise, we should engage in playing these games to the fullest. Given the challenges of cognitive science, we will likely need to explore other games soon.\\n\\nThe Classical strategy for explaining the systematicity of thought hypothesizes a precise formal account of cognitive architecture where mental representation constituents have causally efficacious roles in mental processes. The PTC view denies such an account exists and hypothesizes that, like constituents in quantum mechanics, systematic effects in mental representation processing arise because vector evolution can be (at least partially and approximately) explained in terms of component evolution, even though precise dynamical equations apply at the lower level of individual vector numbers and cannot provide a precise temporal account of processing at the constituent level, i.e., even though constituents are not causally efficacious.',\n"," '\\\\section*{1 The Systematicity Problem and its Classical Solution}\\n\\nThe systematicity problem refers to the observation that cognitive abilities tend to occur in clusters. For instance, there are groups of semantically related mental states such that, according to psychological laws, an organism can only be in one state of the group if it can also be in many of the others. For example, you won\\'t find organisms that can learn to prefer a green triangle over a red square but cannot learn to prefer a red triangle over a green square. Similarly, you won\\'t find organisms that can think the thought \"the girl loves John\" but cannot think \"John loves the girl.\" You also won\\'t find organisms that can infer $P$ from certain cases. For the purposes of this paper, we assume without argument:\\n\\n(a) Cognitive capacities are generally systematic in this sense, both in humans and many non-human organisms.\\n\\n(b) It is nomologically necessary (and thus supports counterfactuals) that this is the case.\\n\\n(c) There must be some psychological mechanism responsible for the systematic nature of cognitive capacities.\\n\\n(d) An adequate theory of cognitive architecture should reveal this mechanism.\\n\\nAny of these points (a)-(d) might be considered contentious; however, as far as we can determine, all four are accepted by Smolensky. Therefore, we will consider them as common ground in our discussion.\\n\\nThe Classical account of the mechanism behind systematicity relies heavily on the notion that mental representation is akin to language. Specifically, mental representations possess a combinatorial syntax and semantics. We will now briefly discuss the Classical view of the syntax and semantics of mental representations, which forms the foundation for understanding the Classical approach to systematicity.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Sentence}\\n\\nIt is assumed that the mental representation formed when one considers the thought \"John loves the girl\" is a complex symbol, with its Classical components including representations of John, the girl, and the act of loving.\\n\\nIn section 3, it will become evident that a significant issue is whether the complex mental representations proposed in Smolensky\\'s theory possess constituent structure. We aim to avoid this issue devolving into a mere terminological debate. Therefore, we define that for a pair of expression types, E1 and E2, E1 is a Classical constituent of E2 only if E1 is present whenever E2 is present. For instance, the English word \"John\" is a Classical constituent of the English sentence \"John loves the girl,\" and every instance of the latter implies an instance of the former (specifically, every instance of the latter contains an instance of the former; you cannot say \"John loves the girl\" without saying \"John\"). Similarly, it is assumed that a mentalese symbol representing John is a Classical constituent of the mentalese symbol that signifies \"John loves the girl.\" Thus, instances of one symbol necessitate instances of the other.\\n\\nClassical constituents possess this property, making them always accessible to operations defined over the complex symbols that contain them. In particular, Classical mental representations have Classical constituents, providing domains for structure-sensitive mental processes. We will see that what Smolensky proposes as the \\'constituents\\' of connectionist mental representations are non-Classical in this regard, which is why his theory does not account for systematicity.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Classical Semantics}\\n\\nIn the classical framework, both for mental representation and natural language representation, it is generally understood that when a complex formula (such as a sentence) $S$ expresses a proposition $P$, the constituents of $S$ express or refer to the elements of $P$. For instance, the proposition that \"John loves the girl\" includes the individuals John and the girl, as well as the two-place relation \\'loving\\'. Similarly, the English sentence \"John loves the girl\" comprises the expressions \\'John\\', \\'loves\\', and \\'the girl\\' as its constituents. \\n\\nConsider the sentence \"John left and the girl wept,\" which includes the sub-formulas \"John left\" and \"the girl wept.\" This sentence expresses the proposition that John left and the girl wept, which in turn includes the propositions that John left and that the girl wept. This pattern continues in similar cases.\\n\\nThese assumptions about the syntax and semantics of mental representations are encapsulated in condition (C):\\n\\n(C): If a proposition $P$ can be expressed within a system of mental representation $M$, then $M$ contains a complex mental representation (a \\'mental sentence\\') $S$, such that $S$ expresses $P$ and the classical constituents of $S$ express or refer to the elements of $P$.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Systematicity}\\n\\nThe classical explanation of systematicity posits that condition (C) holds by nomological necessity, serving as a psychological law that encompasses all systematic minds. It becomes evident why systematicity is easily explained under the assumptions that, firstly, mental representations adhere to condition (C), and secondly, mental processes have access to the constituent structure of these representations. For instance, since condition (C) implies that anyone capable of representing a proposition can inherently represent its elements, it specifically suggests that someone who can represent the proposition \"John loves the girl\" can also represent \"John,\" \"the girl,\" and the two-place relation \"loving.\" Notice, however, that the proposition \"the girl loves John\" is also composed of these same individuals and relations. Therefore, assuming that the processes integrating mental representations of propositions have access to their constituents, it follows that anyone who can represent \"John\\'s loving the girl\" can also represent \"the girl\\'s loving John.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, consider that the constituents of the mental representation activated when one thinks \"P \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\mathcal{E} R\" and those activated when one thinks \"P \\\\mathcal{Q} Q\" both include the mental representation activated when one thinks \"P.\" Suppose further that the mental processes facilitating inference have access to the constituent structure of mental representations. In that case, it should be unsurprising that anyone who can infer \"P\" from \"P \\\\mathcal{E} Q R\" can also infer \"P\" from \"P \\\\mathcal{E} Q.\"\\n\\nIn summary, the classical solution to the systematicity problem asserts that (a) systems of mental representation satisfy condition (C), meaning complex mental representations have classical constituents, and (b) mental processes are sensitive to the constituent structure of these representations. Our critique of Smolensky is as follows: firstly, the cognitive architecture he supports does not accommodate mental representations with classical constituents; secondly, he offers no explanation for how mental processes could be structure-sensitive without classical constituents; and thirdly, he provides no insight into how minds could be systematic if mental processes lack structure sensitivity. Consequently, his response to Fodor and Pylyshyn is inadequate.\\n\\nThe remainder of the chapter will focus on substantiating this analysis.',\n"," '# 2 Weak Compositionality\\n\\nSmolensky\\'s perspective on \\'weak\\' compositional structure is not explicitly detailed and must be inferred from his \\'coffee story,\\' which he narrates in both papers under discussion and in Chapter 2. We will now examine this story.\\n\\nSmolensky begins by questioning how we should understand the relationship between the mental representation of COFFEE and the mental representation of CUP WITH COFFEE. His response to this question involves four key aspects:\\n\\n1. COFFEE and CUP WITH COFFEE are activity vectors. According to Smolensky\\'s weak compositional account, this applies to the mental representations of all common-sense concepts. Whether this holds for technical concepts is irrelevant for our discussion. A vector is a magnitude with a specific direction. A pattern of activity over a group of \\'units\\' is a state where each member of the group has an activation value of 1 or 0. Activity vectors represent these patterns of activity.\\n\\n2. CUP WITH COFFEE representations include COFFEE representations as (non-Classical) constituents in the sense that they contain them as component vectors. By definition, a vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\) is a component vector of \\\\(\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\) if there exists a vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\) such that \\\\(\\\\mathbf{a} + \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\) (where \\'+\\' denotes vector addition). More generally, according to Smolensky, the relationship between vectors and their non-Classical constituents is that the former can be derived from the latter through vector analysis operations. COFFEE and CUP WITH COFFEE representations are activity vectors over units representing micro-features (such as BROWN, LIQUID, MADE OF PORCELAIN, etc.).\\n\\n3. COFFEE (and presumably any other representation vector) is context-dependent. Specifically, the activity vector representing COFFEE in CUP WITH COFFEE is distinct from the activity vector representing COFFEE in, for example, GLASS WITH COFFEE or CAN WITH COFFEE. This suggests that the vector, without a specified context, does not provide necessary conditions for being coffee. We will later see that Smolensky apparently believes it doesn\\'t specify sufficient conditions for being coffee either.\\n\\nClaims (1) and (2) introduce the ideas that mental representations are activity vectors and have (non-Classical) constituents. These ideas are neutral regarding the distinction between strong and weak compositionality, so we will discuss them in Section 3. Claim (3) is, in our view, a distraction. The notion of micro-features is unrelated to the question of systematicity and compositionality issues. We will therefore discuss it only briefly. It is claim (4) that differentiates the strong from the weak notion of compositional structure: a representation has weak compositional structure if it contains context-dependent constituents. We will address the question of context-dependent representation here.\\n\\nWe begin by recounting the coffee story (in a slightly condensed form).\\n\\nFollowing Smolensky, we assume heuristically that units have bivalent activity levels, so vectors can be represented by ordered sets of zeros (indicating a unit is \\'off\\') and ones (indicating a unit is \\'on\\'). Thus, Smolensky suggests that the CUP WITH COFFEE representation might be the following activity vector over micro-features:\\n\\n```\\n1-UPRIGHT CONTAINER\\n1-HOT LIQUID\\n0-GLASS CONTACTING WOOD\\n1-PORCELAIN CURVED SURFACE\\n1-BURNT ODOR\\n1-BROWN LIQUID CONTACTING PORCELAIN\\n1-PORCELAIN CURVED SURFACE\\n0-OBLONG SILVER OBJECT\\n1-FINGER-SIZED HANDLE\\n1-BROWN LIQUID WITH CURVED SIDES AND BOTTOM\\n```\\n\\nAccording to Smolensky, this vector contains a COFFEE representation as a constituent. He claims this constituent can be derived from CUP WITH COFFEE by subtracting CUP WITHOUT COFFEE from it. The vector that remains after this subtraction will be COFFEE.\\n\\nThe reader might object that this approach assumes CUP WITHOUT COFFEE is a constituent of CUP WITH COFFEE. Indeed, Smolensky explicitly claims that \"the pattern or vector representing cup with coffee is composed of a vector that can be identified as a distributed representation of cup without coffee together with a vector that can be identified as a particular distributed representation of coffee\" (Chapter 4, p. 175).\\n\\nOne might think this is incorrect. Combining a representation of a cup without coffee with a representation of coffee results not in a representation of a cup with coffee but rather in a representation with the contradictory content of a cup without coffee with coffee. Smolensky\\'s subtraction procedure seems to confuse the representation of a cup without coffee (CUP WITHOUT COFFEE) with the representation of a cup without the representation of coffee (CUP). CUP WITHOUT COFFEE expresses the content of a cup without coffee; CUP combines consistently with COFFEE. But nothing does both.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it must be remembered that Smolensky\\'s mental representations are described as context-dependent and thus noncompositional. We are given no indication of the types of relationships between the semantic properties of complex symbols and their constituents that his theory acknowledges. Perhaps in a semantics where constituents don\\'t contribute their contents to the symbols they belong to, it\\'s acceptable if CUP WITH COFFEE includes CUP WITHOUT COFFEE (or, for that matter, PRIME NUMBER, GRANDMOTHER, FLYING SAUCER, or THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS) among its constituents.\\n\\nTo complete the story, Smolensky provides the following features for CUP WITHOUT COFFEE:\\n\\n```\\n1-UPRIGHT CONTAINER\\n0-HOT LIQUID\\n0-GLASS CONTACTING WOOD\\n1-PORCELAIN CURVED SURFACE\\n0-BURNT ODOR\\n0-BROWN LIQUID CONTACTING PORCELAIN\\n1-PORCELAIN CURVED SURFACE\\n0-OBLONG SILVER OBJECT\\n1-FINGER-SIZED HANDLE\\n0-BROWN LIQUID WITH CURVED SIDES AND BOTTOM\\n```\\n\\nSubtracting this vector from CUP WITH COFFEE, we obtain the following COFFEE representation:\\n\\n```\\n0-UPRIGHT CONTAINER\\n1-HOT LIQUID\\n0-GLASS CONTACTING WOOD\\n0-PORCELAIN CURVED SURFACE\\n1-BURNT ODOR\\n1-BROWN LIQUID CONTACTING PORCELAIN\\n0-PORCELAIN CURVED SURFACE\\n0-OBLONG SILVER OBJECT\\n0-FINGER-SIZED HANDLE\\n1-BROWN LIQUID WITH CURVED SIDES AND BOTTOM\\n```\\n\\nThis, then, is Smolensky\\'s \\'coffee story.\\'',\n"," \"**Comments**\\n\\nIn discussing systematicity, it is generally agreed that the explanation must involve the relationships between complex mental representations and their components. Smolensky suggests that these relationships are combinatorial among vectors. The debate over micro-features is unrelated to this; it only concerns which properties the activation states of individual units express. In classical terms, it questions which symbols form the primitive vocabulary of the mental representation system. If micro-features exist, activation states are limited to expressing 'sensory' properties (Smolensky, 1987, p. 146). Without micro-features, activation states can express properties like being brown and hot, as well as being coffee. Regardless of how this issue is resolved, the question of how the representation COFFEE relates to CUP WITH COFFEE remains unanswered. Therefore, we propose to set aside the discussion of micro-features.\\n\\nRegarding context-dependent representation, Smolensky seems to suggest that the representation of coffee derived from CUP WITH COFFEE is context-dependent, bearing only a 'family resemblance' to the vector representing coffee in other contexts like CAN WITH COFFEE or GLASS WITH COFFEE. Thus, there is no single vector that represents COFFEE, and no single vector is a component of all representations that would have COFFEE as a classical constituent.\\n\\nSmolensky acknowledges that this type of constituency does not account for systematicity and related phenomena. He notes that 'a true constituent can move around and fill different roles in various structures' (chapter 4, p. 177), and the connection between constituency and systematicity hinges on this. For instance, solving the systematicity problem depends on the assumption that tokens of the representation type JOHN express the same content in different contexts, such as loves the GIRL and the GIRL loves. This suggests that explaining systematicity requires context-independent constituents.\\n\\nSmolensky does not clarify how the assumption of weak compositional structure, where mental representation is context-dependent, relates to explaining systematicity. He introduces the notion of weak compositional structure but then shifts to discussing strong compositional structure, leaving the relationship between the two unclear.\\n\\nThe notion of weak compositional structure, as presented by Smolensky, is questionable in coherence. We conclude this section with a few remarks on this point.\\n\\nSmolensky seems to suggest that the coffee vector derived from CUP WITH COFFEE is not a COFFEE representation when isolated. 'This representation is indeed a representation of coffee, but [only?] in a very particular context: the context provided by cup [i.e., CUP]' (Smolensky, 1987, p. 147). If this is the view, it leads to bizarre consequences. For example, a liquid with the properties of coffee in isolation but not actually coffee becomes coffee when poured into a cup, as if by semantic magic.\\n\\nSmolensky explicitly states that the COFFEE vector derived from CUP WITH COFFEE does not provide necessary conditions for being coffee, as a different COFFEE vector would result from GLASS WITH COFFEE. The passage suggests that it does not provide sufficient conditions either. This raises the question of what makes a vector a COFFEE representation and when it has the content coffee.\\n\\nSmolensky seems to hold that the coffee component of CUP WITH COFFEE represents coffee because it is distributed over units representing certain micro-features and is a component vector of a CUP WITH COFFEE representation. However, no details are provided on this reverse compositionality, where the embedding vector determines the contents of its constituents. This lack of explanation raises the question: if being a component of a CUP OF COFFEE representation is required to make a vector a coffee representation, what is required to make a vector a cup of coffee representation? Presumably, CUP OF COFFEE represents a cup of coffee because of its micro-features and because it is a component of another vector, perhaps one representing THERE IS A CUP OF COFFEE ON THE TABLE. Does this process continue indefinitely? If not, some vectors must not be constituents of others. But then, what determines their contents? Not the contents of their constituents, as Smolensky's semantics is not compositional (CUP WITHOUT COFFEE is a constituent of CUP WITH COFFEE, etc.). And not the vectors they are constituents of, as there are none.\\n\\nIt is unclear whether Smolensky has a coherent explanation for how a system of representations could have weak compositional structure.\\n\\nWhat leads Smolensky to embrace his account of weak compositionality? One possibility is that he confuses being a representation of a cup with coffee with being a CUP WITH COFFEE representation. Observing a cup with coffee in a specific context might lead to a mental state representing it with the micro-features Smolensky lists. This mental state would be a representation of a cup with coffee in the sense that it represents a cup of coffee. However, it would not necessarily be a CUP WITH COFFEE representation, and the mental representation of that cup with coffee might differ in other contexts. Thus, which mental representation a cup of coffee receives is context-dependent, as Smolensky states. But this does not make mental representations themselves context-dependent. Specifically, the fact that cups with coffee receive different representations in different contexts does not imply that the mental symbol representing a cup of coffee in one context might represent something else (like a giraffe or The Last of the Mohicans) in another context. We doubt anything will support Smolensky's claim, as we know of no reason to believe it is true.\\n\\nIn summary, it is easy to confuse the true but unremarkable idea that how you mentally represent coffee depends on context with the more contentious idea that the mental representation COFFEE is context-dependent. Assuming Smolensky is confused in this way explains many puzzling aspects of his coffee story. For example, all the micro-features in his examples express perceptual properties (cf. Smolensky's remark that his micro-features yield a 'nearly sensory level representation'). Additionally, the micro-feature 'porcelain curved surface' appears twice in the vector for CUP WITH COFFEE, coffee, cup without coffee, and similar representations. Presumably, Smolensky means that when you look at a cup, you see two curved surfaces, one extending to the left and the other to the right.\\n\\nWhile we suspect this interpretation is correct, we will not pursue it further, as it renders the coffee story irrelevant to the question of what kind of constituency relation a COFFEE representation has to a CUP WITH COFFEE. This question is central to the issues of systematicity.\",\n"," '**3. Strong Compositional Structure**\\n\\nHaving discussed \\'weak\\' compositional structure, we now turn to Smolensky\\'s concept of \\'strong\\' compositional structure. Smolensky posits:\\n\\n\"A true constituent can move around and fill various roles in different structures. Can this be achieved with vectors encoding distributed representations without merely implementing symbolic syntactic constituency? This section aims to demonstrate that the answer is affirmative.\" (Chapter 4, pp. 177-8)\\n\\nBoth weak and strong compositional structures share the idea that mental representations are activity vectors over units and that some mental representations have other mental representations as components. However, Smolensky\\'s discussion of strong compositional structure differs in several ways. Firstly, units are explicitly assumed to have continuous activation levels between 0 and 1. Secondly, he does not mention microfeatures when discussing strong compositional structure. Thirdly, he introduces a new vector operation (multiplication) alongside addition and subtraction. Most importantly, strong compositional structure does not rely on, and seems incompatible with, the notion that mental representations are context-dependent. Thus, it avoids the inconsistencies in Smolensky\\'s theory of context-dependent representation.\\n\\nWe will proceed by first presenting the notion of strong compositional structure, followed by a critique.\\n\\nSmolensky explains strong compositional structure using the concepts of tensor product representation and superposition representation. To illustrate, consider how a connectionist machine might represent four-letter English words. Words can be broken down into roles (ordinal positions for letters) and fillers (letters). The machine might have activity vectors over units representing roles (role units) and fillers (filler units). It might also have activity vectors over units representing filled roles (letters in positions), known as binding units. The key idea is that activity vectors over binding units might be tensor products of activity vectors over role and filler units. A word\\'s representation would then be a superposition vector over the binding units, created by superimposing the tensor product vectors.\\n\\nThe operations used to derive complex vectors from component vectors are vector multiplication for tensor product vectors and vector addition for superposition vectors. These operations are iterative, meaning activity vectors resulting from the multiplication of role and filler vectors might themselves represent fillers of roles in more complex structures. For example, a tensor product representing the word \\'John\\' as \\'J\\' in the first position, \\'o\\' in the second, etc., might be bound to a syntactical function to indicate that \\'John\\' is the subject in \\'John loves the girl\\'. Such tensor product representations could be superimposed over another group of binding units to yield a superposition vector representing the bracketing tree (John) (loves (the girl)).\\n\\nIt is unclear whether this apparatus can represent all semantically relevant syntactic relations that Classical theories express using bracketing trees with Classical constituents. There are issues, such as long-distance binding relations between quantifiers and bound variables. However, for the sake of argument, we assume that each Classical bracketing tree can be encoded into a complex vector so that the tree\\'s constituents correspond to vector components.\\n\\nThis does not imply that tensor product or superposition vectors have Classical constituent structure. From the assumptions that bracketing trees have Classical constituents and can be encoded by activity vectors, it does not follow that activity vectors have Classical constituents. Smolensky explicitly states that the components of a complex vector need not correspond to actual activity patterns over units in the machine. As he puts it, the activity states of filler and role units can be \\'imaginary,\\' even though the ultimate activity vectors must be actual patterns over units in the machine. For instance, the superposition pattern representing \\'John\\' will be an activity vector realized in the machine, but the activity vector representing \\'J\\' will be imaginary, as will the vector for the first letter position. The only actual pattern tokened in the machine is the superposition vector representing \\'John\\'.\\n\\nThese considerations are crucial because Smolensky\\'s strategy invites us to view the components of tensor product and superposition vectors as analogous to Classical constituents of a complex symbol, suggesting they allow connectionist architectures to capture the causal and semantic consequences of Classical constituency in mental representations. However, the components of tensor product and superposition vectors differ from Classical constituents: when a complex Classical symbol is tokened, its constituents are tokened. When a tensor product or superposition vector is tokened, its components are not (except incidentally). This difference implies that while Classical constituents of a complex symbol contribute to the causal consequences of its tokening, the components of tensor product and superposition vectors have no causal status. Imaginary components cannot cause effects.\\n\\nWe will return to the implications for the systematicity problem. However, a preliminary issue needs discussion.\\n\\nThe components of tensor product/superposition vectors, unlike Classical constituents, are not generally tokened when the activity vector they comprise is tokened. Additionally, there is no unique decomposition of a tensor product or superposition vector into components. Given that units have continuous activation levels, there are infinitely many decompositions of a given activity vector. This raises the question of what it means to decompose a mental representation into significant constituents under Smolensky\\'s theory.\\n\\nSmolensky responds by suggesting that cognitive systems are dynamical systems with dynamic equations over individual units\\' activation values, determining regularities over activity vectors. Given the system\\'s dynamical equations, certain decompositions can be useful for \\'explaining and understanding\\' its behavior. Thus, the dynamics of a system may determine \\'normal modes\\' of decomposition into components. For example, a given superposition vector might be decomposed into a small group of sets, or even a unique set, when decomposed in the direction of normal modes; the same applies to tensor product vectors. In principle, given the (undefined) normal modes of a dynamical cognitive system, complex superposition vectors might uniquely decompose into semantically significant parts, similar to Classical complex symbols. However, no grounds for optimism on this point have been provided.\\n\\nDespite this problem, we propose to ignore it. Assuming tensor product and superposition vectors can code constituent structure adequately for propositional content expression, and assuming superposition vectors have a unique decomposition into semantically interpretable tensor product vectors, which in turn decompose into semantically interpretable filler and role vectors, it is determinate which proposition a given complex activity vector represents.\\n\\nAssuming all this, what about the systematicity problem?\\n\\nThe first point is that if tensor product/superposition vector representation solves the systematicity problem, the solution differs from the Classical proposal. True tensor product vectors and superposition vectors \\'have constituents\\' in an extended sense: tensor product vectors have semantically evaluable components, and superposition vectors decompose into semantically evaluable tensor product vectors. However, the Classical solution assumes that mental representation constituents have causal roles, providing domains for mental processes. Classical constituents of a complex symbol contribute to determining the causal consequences of its tokening, whereas the \\'extended\\' constituents of a tensor product/superposition representation cannot. Typically, the components of a complex vector are not tokened when the complex vector is tokened; they are merely constituents into which the complex vector could be resolved according to normal modes. The fact that six could be represented as \\'3 × 2\\' cannot, by itself, affect causal processes in a computer (or brain) where six is represented as \\'6\\'. Only actually tokened representations have causal consequences.\\n\\nSmolensky acknowledges that activity vectors may not have constituent structure in the Classical sense. He defends the claim that he has not distorted the notion of constituency by citing the role of tensor products and superpositions in physical theory:\\n\\n\"The state of the atom, like all systems in quantum theory, is represented by a vector in an abstract vector space. Each electron has an internal state (its \\'spin\\') and a role in the atom (an \\'orbital\\', a probability cloud). The internal state of an electron is represented by a \\'spin vector\\'; the orbital is represented by another vector. The vector representing the electron in the atom is the tensor product of the spin vector and the orbital vector. The atom is represented by a vector that is the sum or superposition of vectors, each representing an electron in its orbital.\" (Chapter 4, p. 196) Smolensky adds, \"someone who claims that the tensor product representational scheme distorts the notion of constituency has some explaining to do\" (p. 196).\\n\\nThe physics lesson is appreciated, but it is important to clarify its purpose. It is not in doubt that tensor products can represent constituent structure. The question is whether tensor product representations have constituent structure, or whether they have the kind of constituent structure to which causal processes can be sensitive, and to which an explanation of systematicity might appeal. We have seen that the constituents of complex activity vectors typically aren\\'t \\'there\\', so if the causal consequences of tokening a complex vector are sensitive to its constituent structure, that\\'s a miracle.\\n\\nWe conclude that assuming mental representations are activation vectors does not allow Smolensky to endorse the Classical solution to the systematicity problem. Smolensky admits that mental processes will not be causally sensitive to the strong compositional structure of mental representations. He acknowledges that the constituents of complex mental representations play no causal role in determining what happens when the representations are tokened. \"Causal efficacy was not my goal in developing the tensor product representation\" (Chapter 4, p. 190). According to connectionists, the activation values of individual units are causally efficacious; the dynamical equations governing the system\\'s evolution are defined over these. It appears Smolensky must have a non-Classical solution to the systematicity problem that does not depend on assuming mental processes are causally sensitive to constituent structure. However, Smolensky does not specify this solution. He hypothesizes that systematic effects in mental representation processing arise because vector evolution can be (at least partially and approximately) explained in terms of component evolution, even though precise dynamical equations apply only at the lower level of individual numbers comprising the vectors and cannot provide a precise temporal account of processing at the level of entire constituents, which are not causally efficacious. (Chapter 4, p. 191).\\n\\nIt remains unclear how the constituents (\\'components\\') of complex vectors explain their evolution when they are, by assumption, at best causally inert and, at worst, merely imaginary. Smolensky believes that unspecified processes affecting individual units\\' activation states (neuron analogs) are causally responsible for vector evolution and, hence, cognition\\'s systematicity. As far as we can tell, the proposed connectionist explanation of systematicity (and related cognitive features) is that Smolensky \\'hypothesizes\\' systematicity is a consequence of underlying neural processes. If that is Smolensky\\'s theory, it is certainly true but not intimately dependent on his extensive discussion of fillers, binders, tensor products, superposition vectors, and the rest.\\n\\nTo conclude, we address a question from an anonymous Cognition reviewer: \"Couldn\\'t Smolensky easily build in mechanisms to accomplish the matrix algebra operations that would make the necessary vector explicit (or better yet, from his point of view, mechanisms sensitive to the imaginary components without literally making them explicit in some string of units)?\" This misses the point of the systematicity problem for connectionists, which is not to show that systematic cognitive capacities are possible given connectionist architecture assumptions, but to explain how systematicity could be necessary—how cognitive capacities are systematically lawful—given those assumptions.\\n\\nSmolensky could wire a network to support a vector representing $a R b$ if and only if it supports a vector representing $b R a$; perhaps he could do so without making imaginary units explicit (though there is no proposal for ensuring this for arbitrary $a, R$, and $b$). The architecture permits this, but it also permits wiring a network to support a vector representing $a R b$ if and only if it supports a vector representing $z S q$; or, for that matter, if it supports a vector representing The Last of the Mohicans. The architecture appears indifferent to these options.\\n\\nIn Classical architecture, if you meet the conditions for representing $a R b$, you cannot help but meet the conditions for representing $b R a$; the architecture enforces this because (a) the representation of $a, R$, and $b$ are constituents of the representation of $a R b$, and (b) you must token the constituents of the representations you token, so Classical constituents cannot be imaginary. Thus, the Classical picture ensures you cannot think $a R b$ unless you can think $b R a$, but the connectionist picture is neutral on whether you can think $a R b$ even if you cannot think $b R a$. It is a law of nature that you cannot think $a R b$ if you cannot think $b R a$. Therefore, the Classical picture explains systematicity, and the connectionist picture does not. The Classical picture prevails.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{Principles of ICS}\\n\\n1. **$\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$**: In all cognitive domains, cognitive processes are characterized by algorithms that facilitate the spread of activation among connectionist units.\\n\\n2. **$\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$**: In all cognitive domains, representations are manifested as distributed patterns of activity.\\n\\n3. **$\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{sym}}$**: In fundamental areas of higher cognitive domains, representations take the form of symbolic structures.\\n\\n4. **$\\\\mathrm{Sem}_{\\\\text{sym}}$**: The semantic interpretation of these symbolic representations is derived compositionally from their syntactic structure.\\n\\n5. **Fun$_{\\\\text{sym}}$**: In core areas of higher cognitive domains, the input/output functions executed by cognitive processes are described by (recursive) symbolic functions.\\n\\nThe principles $\\\\mathrm{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$ and $\\\\mathrm{Rep}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$ are rooted in the parallel distributed processing (PDP) approach to connectionism.

This distinction is a key source of ICS's innovation and strength, yet it also contributes to its complexity. Repsym, Semsym, and Funsym assert that higher cognitive representations, semantics, and functions are symbolic, while Algics posits that cognitive algorithms are not. Consequently, symbols and their governing rules hold a peculiar status: they are real in terms of governing semantics and computed functions, but not real in terms of participating in a causal narrative that can be captured as an algorithm of the internal mechanism computing these functions. What theoretical value could such non-causal symbols have? How can they help explain regularities in the cognitive system if they are not integral to the algorithms driving its behavior?\\n\\nAddressing these questions is the core of this chapter and requires extensive discussion after the foundational concepts are introduced in section 2.1. The answers are complex but can be summarized as follows: algorithms are just one type of structure that may exist in a processing system; other structures also provide explanations for system behavior. The connections within the networks of the ICS architecture are governed by structural principles that ensure symbolic functions are computed, but not by instantiating a symbolic algorithm. This structure is defined over an abstract space that does not involve the spatial and temporal decompositions necessary for defining symbolic algorithms. Designing such abstract structures is crucial to developing ICS. The abstract structure essential for cognitive explanation makes it inappropriate to assign causal roles to the symbols and the rules governing them.\",\n"," '**1.2 Goals**\\n\\nTo effectively evaluate the success of ICS (see section 4.3), it is essential to clearly outline its goals from the beginning.\\n\\n**Goals of ICS**\\n\\n1. **Preservation**: Maintain the depth of explanation for higher cognition currently achieved by symbolic theory. This includes the basic cognitive properties highlighted in F&P, particularly the productivity of higher cognition, and explanatory accounts of human linguistic competence.\\n\\n2. **Reduction**: Explain how symbolic computation is grounded in neural computation.\\n\\n3. **Revision**: Use insights from the reduction of symbolic computation to lower-level principles to enhance symbolic accounts of higher cognition.\\n\\n4. **Integration**: Understand how symbolic computational principles that explain core aspects of higher cognition integrate with computational principles explaining other cognitive aspects.\\n\\nThe new ICS architecture is necessary because existing architectures—whether symbolic, connectionist, or hybrid—are inadequate for addressing all these goals simultaneously. Before justifying this statement, it is important to discuss reduction, which is the primary motivation for ICS and a prerequisite for the other main goal, revision.\\n\\n**1.2.1 Reduction, Neural Nets, and Connectionist Nets**\\n\\nWhile few cognitive scientists reject physicalism, many have been content with theories that ignore the physical substrate of cognition. Symbolic theory, unaided, might offer insights into the relationship between the symbolic architecture and lower-level cognitive machines. However, for decades, it has only provided a \"Total Mystery\" regarding the underpinnings of symbolic computation. To take reduction seriously, we must look beyond Classical symbolic theory.\\n\\nDeveloping computational accounts that replicate every detail of brain structure would likely fail if the goal is reduction rather than elimination of symbolic theory. Achieving reduction requires balancing the preservation of symbolic and neural computation principles to construct a coherent theory and move towards unification. PDP connectionism preserves fundamental principles of neural computation, making it a good starting point for reduction. Although PDP architectures ignore many neural system facts, they differ fundamentally from classical architectures, aligning more closely with neural computation. A reduction of symbolic architecture to a PDP architecture is a significant step and historically unprecedented.\\n\\nSome dismiss PDP architectures for ignoring neural structure details. While this is understandable for experimental neuroscientists, it is unreasonable for proponents of Classical symbolic theory. Classical theory only acknowledges the brain\\'s complexity without understanding it, making it the perfect host for the \"Total Mystery Theory.\"\\n\\nIf reduction is a serious goal, we must look beyond symbolic theory. Detailed neural modeling is currently too disconnected from high-level symbolic computation. Eliminativist connectionism also fails, as it denies the need to explain symbolic architecture. Hybrid architectures do not address reduction. The practical approach is Implementationalist Connectionism.\\n\\nImplementationalist Connectionism seeks to implement symbolic computation in connectionist networks, described at two levels: algorithms for unit activity and symbolic representations and algorithms. This interlevel reduction defines the implementation relation between description levels in conventional computers.\\n\\nImplementationalist Connectionism has limited prospects for achieving revision (goal 12). It is top-down, with few opportunities for connectionist computation to inform new higher-level theory. However, ICS is not Implementationalism, as it rejects certain tenets of Implementationalism. ICS allows new insights for grammar theory to emerge from connectionist computation principles, unlike Implementationalism. ICS relies on a partial embedding of symbolic computation in PDP networks.\\n\\n**1.2.2 ICS Strategies**\\n\\nBefore delving into the ICS story, it is helpful to outline the ICS strategies for achieving goals (10)-(13) and how they leverage principles from both symbolic and PDP connectionist computation.\\n\\n**ICS Strategies for Achieving Goals (10)-(13)**\\n\\n1. **Preservation**: Maintain a higher level of computational description where representations and functions have symbolic form, allowing reference to basic cognitive principles (Section 3).\\n\\n2. **Reduction**: Demonstrate how abstract global structures in distributed connectionist activity can be described as symbolic constituency (Section 2.1) and how connection patterns entail symbolic functions (Section 2.2).\\n\\n3. **Revision**: Show how connectionist computation optimization principles influence higher-level organizational principles for grammar (Section 2.3), enhancing linguistic theory\\'s explanatory power (Section 3.3).\\n\\n4. **Integration**: Fundamental ICS computational principles for core higher cognition (and language) are special cases of more general principles underlying many connectionist models of other cognitive domains (Section 4.3.1).\\n\\nThe chapter will explain the new ICS computational architecture in section 2, discussing how symbols and rules play essential roles in computational explanations without being part of a causal, algorithmic processing account. These results are integrated into a cognitive architecture theory in section 3, demonstrating that the new architecture explains fundamental \\'symbolic\\' cognitive properties and refines symbolic theory, particularly in generative grammar. In section 4, I argue that ICS is as adequate as Classical theory in explaining the necessity of cognitive systems to display \\'symbolic\\' properties and that ICS has made meaningful contributions towards realizing all these goals.\\n\\nI must admit that \\'platitudinality\\' is not a goal of ICS. Some might prefer a simple explanation of how symbolic computation arises from neural computation, but I enjoy other ways of spending time with Granny.',\n"," \"**2.1.1 The Power of PDP vs. Local Connectionist Networks**\\n\\nTo address these issues, it is helpful to distinguish between two broad categories of connectionist architectures. I will refer to the 'weaker' networks as 'PDP models' and the 'stronger' ones as 'local connectionist networks'. In PDP models, information is represented by patterns of activity. An input is encoded as a pattern, and in the simplest scenario, this activity flows through a set of connections to form an output pattern. The input/output mapping is achieved through simple associations between inputs and outputs. There is no inherent structure in the input that corresponds to symbolic representations, such as nested constituents, nor are the processes structure-sensitive. Since the strengths of associative connections in PDP models are typically determined by sampling an 'environment' of input/output pairs, these connections often reflect statistical correlations from experience. Consequently, it is frequently argued that processing in such networks is sensitive to statistics but not to structure. This makes them an unlikely medium for implementing symbolic structure processing.\\n\\nIn contrast, the story for local connectionist models is quite different. Often, the units in these models are binary on/off units, each representing the Boolean value true/false of potentially complex propositions. These units are typically interconnected through carefully designed schemes, and their decision rules (regarding when to be on or off) are equally meticulously crafted, enabling the network to compute the truth value of a set of propositions. A historically significant example of such networks is the work of McCulloch and Pitts (1943), which is considered pivotal in the development of digital computers. The relationship between computation in these networks and symbolic computation is very close. Another example is a network described in Minsky's (1967, s. 3.5) text, which simulates a finite-state automaton. Each unit represents a combination of an input symbol and an internal machine state, with only one unit active at a time. Such a network could serve as the 'CPU' of a Turing machine, connected to a conventional Turing machine tape. The tape itself could be replaced by an unbounded set of local connectionist units or even a single unit with infinite precision activation value (Pollack, 1987). The theory of local connectionist networks is so closely linked with classical computation and automata theory that distinguishing between them may be impossible.\\n\\nIn summary, local connectionist networks are essentially a subset of conventional computation theory. Aside from the usual technical details (see, e.g., Smolensky et al., forthcoming), there are no fundamental differences between the computational power of these networks and that of Turing machines. Implementing symbolic computation in such networks can be done in various ways and is generally straightforward, though not always insightful.\\n\\nOn the other hand, implementing any significant and powerful subset of symbolic computation with PDP models seems quite challenging. Apart from the ICS architecture described here, I am unaware of any principled and general approach. Therefore, it is important to understand that the proposal discussed in this chapter is a method for partially embedding symbolic computation in PDP models specifically, not in 'connectionist networks' broadly enough to include local connectionist models. Some key properties of ICS that make it a PDP approach to embedding symbolic computation are as follows:\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{Symbol Processing in ICS: PDP vs. Local Connectionism}\\n\\n(18) **Distributed Representation**: In a PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing) model, a symbolic structure is represented by a pattern of activity across a set of units. Each unit contributes to the representation of multiple constituents within this structure: $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\mathrm{pdp}}$ (2).\\n\\n(19) **Parallel Processing**: When a structure is processed, all its constituents are processed simultaneously: $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{ics}}(9)$.\\n\\n(20) **Continuity**: The activity patterns representing symbolic structures form a discrete subset within a continuous space of patterns. This space allows for the processing of similar but distinct patterns by the network.\\n\\nNo other theoretical approach to the connectionist realization of symbolic computation, to my knowledge, exhibits these properties. Local connectionist networks certainly do not.\\n\\nUnderstanding the significance of property (18) is crucial: it highlights the distributed representation characteristic of PDP. Many people view connectionist networks in terms of individual units, but in PDP networks, a representation is found in an activity pattern, not a single unit. Mathematically, an activity pattern is a vector, a list of numbers like $(0.3, -1.2, 0.9, \\\\ldots)$, representing the activity of all units involved. This distinction between local connectionist networks and PDP models can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n**Contrast Between PDP and Local Connectionism:**\\n\\n(21) (a) In local connectionist networks, a representation is carried by a single unit.  \\n(b) In PDP models, a representation is carried by a vector.\\n\\nImportantly, the same units define the representational vector for different representations: different representations are different activity vectors over a fixed set of units, not activity over different units.\\n\\nTo partially embed symbolic computation in a PDP model, we must address the following questions:\\n\\n**Central Questions in Designing ICS:**\\n\\n(22) (a) How can vectors be treated as symbol structures?  \\n(b) How can PDP networks process these vectors to achieve structure-sensitive processing?\\n\\n**2.1.2 A Bit of Vector Space Theory**\\n\\nThe importance of vectors in PDP theory (21b) and their role in designing ICS (22) is crucial. Vector operations, such as matrix multiplication, are central to refining question (22b) about PDP processing. Information processing in PDP networks involves the spread of activation, typically through matrix multiplication. In most networks, matrix multiplication is the core process, around which more complex operations occur. In its purest form, PDP processing is matrix multiplication. This is central to ICS explanations, so let's clarify it.\\n\\nThe simplest PDP model is the 'linear associator', which functions as follows: Input units hold an activation vector $\\\\mathbf{i}$ encoding input. Output units will host another activation vector $\\\\mathbf{o}$, encoding the output associated with $\\\\mathbf{i}$, after activation spreads from input to output units via connections with specific weights. If an input unit has activity value $i$ and its connection to an output unit has weight $w$, the output unit receives activation equal to $w \\\\cdot i$. The output unit sums all contributions to determine its activation value $o$. Let input units be labeled $1, 2, \\\\ldots$; use $\\\\alpha$ to denote any input unit label. The activity of input unit $\\\\alpha$ is $i_{\\\\alpha}$. The input vector is $\\\\mathbf{i} = (i_{1}, i_{2}, \\\\ldots, i_{\\\\alpha}, \\\\ldots)$. Using $\\\\beta$ for output unit labels, and $o_{\\\\beta}$ for output unit activity, the output vector is $\\\\boldsymbol{o} = (o_{1}, o_{2}, \\\\ldots, o_{\\\\beta}, \\\\ldots)$. The weight from input unit $\\\\alpha$ to output unit $\\\\beta$ is $W_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}$. The activation output unit $\\\\beta$ receives from input unit $\\\\alpha$ is $W_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} i_{\\\\alpha}$. The total activity of output unit $\\\\beta$ is the sum of all such contributions:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\no_{\\\\beta} = W_{\\\\beta 1} i_{1} + W_{\\\\beta 2} i_{2} + \\\\ldots + W_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} i_{\\\\alpha} + \\\\ldots = \\\\Sigma_{\\\\alpha} W_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} i_{\\\\alpha} \\\\tag{23}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\n(for all output units $\\\\beta$)\\n\\nThe last expression denotes the sum over all values of $\\\\alpha (\\\\Sigma_{\\\\alpha})$ of the weight to output unit $\\\\beta$ from input unit $\\\\alpha (W_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha})$ times the activity of input unit $\\\\alpha (i_{\\\\alpha})$. A compact way of writing equation (23) is:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\mathbf{o} = \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{i} \\\\tag{24}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThis states that the vector $\\\\mathbf{o}$ is the product of the matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ and the vector $\\\\mathbf{i}$. Here, $\\\\mathbf{W}$ is the weight matrix of the network, comprising all weights $\\\\mathrm{W}_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}$ between input and output units. The matrix multiplication operation, denoted by $\\\\cdot$, is defined so that (24) is an abbreviation for (23).\\n\\n**2.1.3 The Problem Refined**\\n\\nLet's conclude our clarification of the computational problems ICS aims to solve. In section 2.1.1, we noted that while realizing symbolic computation in local connectionist networks is straightforward, achieving this within PDP connectionism is much more challenging, if not seemingly impossible. The defining property of PDP is that representations are borne by activity vectors, so section 2.1.2 focused on vector space theory basics. The core of processing in PDP models is the multiplication of an activity vector by a connection weight matrix. We now apply these refinements to the fundamental principles of ICS outlined in section 1.1 (1-5). The principles concerning representations (2,3) are now:\\n\\n**Representational Principles of ICS:**\\n\\n(25) $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$: In all cognitive domains, representations are vectors $(\\\\cong 2)$.  \\n(26) $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$: In core parts of higher cognitive domains, representations are symbol structures $(=3)$.\\n\\nOur first sub-problem, question (22a) from section 2.1.1, is now:\\n\\n(27) $\\\\mathrm{Q}_{\\\\text{rep}}$: How can $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$ and $\\\\mathrm{Rep}_{\\\\text{sym}}$ be simultaneously correct? That is, how can one computational data object be both a vector of connectionist activations and a symbol structure?\\n\\nThe principles concerning processing (1,5) are now:\\n\\n**Processing Principles of ICS:**\\n\\n(28) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$: In all cognitive domains, cognitive processes are spreading activation algorithms $(=1)$.  \\n(29) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(\\\\mathrm{W})$: The core operation is the multiplication of an input activation vector $\\\\mathbf{i}$ by a weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ to obtain the output vector: $\\\\mathbf{o} = \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{i} (=24)$.  \\n(30) $\\\\operatorname{Fun}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$: In core parts of higher cognitive domains, the input/output functions computed by cognitive processes are described by (recursive) symbolic functions $(=5)$.\\n\\nOur second sub-problem, question (22b), is:\\n\\n(31) $\\\\mathrm{Q}_{\\\\text{proc}}$: How can $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(\\\\mathrm{W})$ and $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\text{sym}}$ be simultaneously correct? That is, how can one computation be both a spreading activation process (e.g., matrix multiplication) and the computation of a symbolic function, such as a function that takes inputs like [John [loves Mary]] and generates outputs like loves(John, Mary), where the symbols John and Mary can be replaced by arbitrarily complex phrases?\\n\\nTo answer these questions, $\\\\mathrm{Q}_{\\\\text{rep}}$ and $\\\\mathrm{Q}_{\\\\text{proc}}$, and thereby partially embed symbolic computation in a PDP model, the work on implementing symbolic computation in local connectionist networks is, unfortunately, quite irrelevant.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{2.2.1.1 The Combinatorial Strategy for Explaining Productivity}\\n\\nProductivity is arguably the most remarkable feature of higher cognition, often idealized as the capacity to accurately process an infinite variety of inputs using a finite amount of knowledge. Classical cognitive theory has developed a highly successful strategy to address this phenomenon across a wide range of cognitive domains:\\n\\n(32) The combinatorial strategy accounts for productivity by positing that mental representations, akin to sentences in a language, are composed of arrays of symbols that can be combined in infinitely diverse ways. Mental processes, operating on recursive principles, can manage this infinite combinatorial variation using only finitely specified knowledge.\\n\\nIf we can satisfactorily address $\\\\mathrm{Q}_{\\\\text{rep}}$, the ICS architecture will have the necessary foundation to employ the combinatorial strategy: constituent structured representations. If not, an alternative strategy will be needed to explain productivity (or to refute it). Eliminativist, empiricist connectionism attempts to tackle the challenge of productivity by demonstrating that a connectionist network, when presented with a set of input/output examples from a function, can learn to generalize to novel examples. While this work may implicitly offer a broad and powerful explanation for the productivity of higher cognition, it remains experimental rather than theoretical at this stage. Currently, there are only isolated examples of networks, which inspire optimism among eliminativist empiricist connectionists that the approach will eventually explain productivity, though others remain skeptical. In ICS, I avoid the eliminativist empiricist connectionism approach, opting instead to embrace the combinatorial strategy for explaining productivity in the absence of a well-defined theoretical alternative.\\n\\nIt is important to note that while ICS incorporates aspects of the Classical strategy for explaining productivity, it also rejects certain elements. The combinatorial strategy (32) does not specify the nature of (a) 'finitely specified knowledge' and (b) 'recursive principles' employed. In classical architecture, but not in ICS, these take the form of (a) a finite set of symbol manipulation rules and (b) a recursive sequential process for applying these rules—in essence, symbolic algorithms, which are not part of ICS. In both classical and ICS architectures, mental representations in core areas of higher cognition possess a combinatorial constituent structure. However, in classical architectures, these constituents have a causal role in processing, unlike in ICS. Let us now proceed to define these vectorial constituents.\",\n"," '### 2.2.1.2 Tensor Product Representations\\n\\nIn the realm of Classical theory, mental representations are often described as a set of symbol structures, where their semantics are recursively determined from their syntax. To illustrate the recursive nature of these symbol structures, I will use the Lisp convention, which represents all symbol structures as binary-branching trees. For example, the proposition \"Sandy loves Kim\" can be symbolically represented as:\\n\\nThis tree can be written as $[\\\\mathrm{L},[\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]]$, and sometimes abbreviated using predicate calculus notation as $\\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K})$. Here, the atomic symbols L, S, and K denote the predicate and arguments corresponding to \"loves,\" \"Sandy,\" and \"Kim,\" respectively. In Classical theory, we typically stop at this point without delving into how these symbols are realized or combined. However, in ICS (Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic), we propose a theory for how such realizations occur.\\n\\n#### 2.2.1.2.1 Definition\\n\\nIn ICS, the proposition $p = [\\\\mathrm{L},[\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]]$ is realized as a connectionist activity vector:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{L} + \\\\mathrm{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\left[\\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\mathrm{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{K}\\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis expression can be compared to its symbolic counterpart. The symbolic representation $[\\\\mathrm{L},[\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]]$ depends on associating the predicate \"love\" and the arguments \"Sandy\" and \"Kim\" with the symbols L, S, and K. Similarly, in ICS, the representation of $p$ relies on associating \"love,\" \"Sandy,\" and \"Kim\" with the activity vectors $\\\\mathrm{L}, \\\\mathrm{S}$, and $\\\\mathrm{K}$.\\n\\nThe ICS representation of $p$ also depends on associating the argument \"Sandy\" with a vector $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0}$, signifying the \\'left branch\\' of a binary-branching tree node. This is evident in the part $r_{0} \\\\otimes S$ of the ICS representation. Correspondingly, the argument \"Kim\" is associated with a vector $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$, signifying the \\'right branch\\'. The vectors $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$ are fundamental building blocks for defining representations in binary trees. They must be independent vectors, meaning one cannot be a multiple of the other, such as $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0} = 2 \\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$.\\n\\nTo avoid confusion, I will denote $[\\\\mathrm{L},[\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]]$ by the more customary $\\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K})$ when there is little risk of misunderstanding. The binary tree structure in [L, [S, K]] more clearly exhibits the recursive nature of these syntactic structures than the string notation $\\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K})$. Therefore, I will treat the former as the \\'real\\' symbolic structure and the latter as a convenient abbreviation.\\n\\nHaving discussed the vectors $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0}, \\\\mathbf{r}_{1}, \\\\mathbf{L}, \\\\mathbf{S}$, and $\\\\mathbf{K}$ in the expression, we now define the operations used to combine these vectors into the vector $\\\\mathbf{p}$ representing the entire proposition $p$. These operations are vector addition (+) and the tensor product ($\\\\otimes$). Vector addition combines vectors representing sub-constituents into a vector representing a composite structure. Mathematically, vector addition is defined element-by-element, such as $(2,-3,5) + (0,3,-2) = (2,0,3)$. This operation is often called superposition, as it resembles how waves superimpose in physical media.\\n\\nThe tensor product ($\\\\otimes$) is used to \\'place a sub-tree in the left branch role\\'. For example, to place a sub-tree $x$ in the left branch role, we bind the vector representing $x$ to the vector $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ representing the \\'left branch\\' role by taking the tensor product:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{x}_{0} = \\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{x}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe tensor product operation is defined as follows: given two vectors $\\\\mathbf{r} = (r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots)$ and $\\\\mathbf{f} = (f_1, f_2, \\\\ldots)$, their tensor product is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{f} = (\\\\ldots, r_i f_j, \\\\ldots)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIf there are $n$ elements in vector $\\\\mathbf{r}$ and $m$ elements in vector $\\\\mathbf{f}$, their tensor product will have $n \\\\times m$ elements. A critical property of the tensor product is that it can be embedded recursively. For instance, if $\\\\mathbf{f}$ is already a tensor product, say $\\\\mathbf{f} = \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{b}$, the result is a three-way tensor product $\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\otimes (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{b})$.\\n\\nThis recursive property allows for the recursive binding of sub-trees to left/right branch roles, as demonstrated in the example of $\\\\mathbf{p}$:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\mathbf{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{L} + \\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{K}\\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe structure of this vector mirrors that of $\\\\mathrm{p} = [\\\\mathrm{L},[\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]]$. The left sub-tree of $p$ is the symbol L, and one constituent of the vector $p$ is $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{L}$. Superimposed on this constituent is another representing the right sub-tree $[\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]$ of $p$: the vector $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes [\\\\mathbf{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{K}]$. This vector results from binding the right-branch role vector $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$ to the vector $\\\\mathbf{f}$, which represents the sub-tree [S, K]. The vector $\\\\mathbf{f}$ is itself a tensor product representation with internal structure $\\\\mathbf{f} = [\\\\mathbf{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{S} + \\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{K}]$. Recursively examining $\\\\mathbf{f}$, we see the same structure as for $p$: it is the superposition of two constituent vectors, one for the left sub-tree and the other for the right. Both sub-trees are simple symbols, so there is no further decomposition; the atomic sub-trees S and K are directly represented by their corresponding vectors S and K.\\n\\nThis process exemplifies the general rule:\\n\\n**Recursive Tensor Product Representations:** The realization of $[p, q]$, where $p$ and $q$ are any two symbolic sub-trees, is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{p} + \\\\mathrm{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{q}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere $p$ and $q$ are the respective realizations of $p$ and $q$.\\n\\nThis concludes the definition of recursive tensor product representations. The constituent structure present in these vectors is the solution that ICS provides to the question $\\\\mathrm{Q}_{\\\\text{rep}}$. To formulate this as a principle:\\n\\n**Rep$_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$:** In core parts of higher cognitive domains, representations are vectors with the structure of recursive tensor product representations.\\n\\nHere, \\'HC\\' labels the specialized versions of more general cognitive principles assumed to apply in higher cognitive domains.\\n\\n#### 2.2.1.2.2 Semantic Interpretation\\n\\nSo far, we\\'ve discussed the semantic relationship between vectors and propositions only in the direction from propositions to vectors: given a proposition, what vector represents it? A few new issues arise when we consider the reverse direction.\\n\\nAny vector like $\\\\mathbf{p}$ can be expressed as the sum of other vectors in an infinite variety of ways. Thus, it might seem that there is ambiguity in determining the constituents of a given vector like $\\\\mathbf{p}$. To illustrate, consider the $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$ sub-constituent of $\\\\mathbf{p}$:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{q} = \\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\mathrm{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{K}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis vector realizes the right sub-tree $\\\\mathrm{q} = [\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]$ in the symbolic expression for $\\\\mathbf{p}$. To determine that this vector realizes $[\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]$, we must recognize it as the sum of two vectors, one for each constituent $S$ and $K$:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{q} = \\\\mathrm{q}_{\\\\mathrm{S}} + \\\\mathrm{q}_{\\\\mathrm{K}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nHowever, if $\\\\mathbf{q}$ can be decomposed into a sum of two vectors in infinitely many ways, what singles out the correct pair of vectors $\\\\mathbf{q}_{\\\\mathrm{S}}$ and $\\\\mathbf{q}_{\\\\mathrm{K}}$? The answer is that for semantic interpretation, not just any two vectors will do: one must be of the form $\\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{x}$, and the other of the form $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{y}$, for some pair of vectors $\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}$. The independence of $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$ ensures that only one such pair of vectors $\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}$ can work in the decomposition of $\\\\mathbf{q}$. A simple proof is provided in Appendix section A.1.\\n\\nTo summarize, ambiguities arise if $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$ are equal or simple multiples of each other; but as long as this degenerate case is avoided, there cannot be two semantic interpretations of a single vector. Comparable degeneracies must be avoided in any representational scheme; for example, ambiguities would be unavoidable in a symbolic system where the symbol for Kim was identical to that for Sandy, or where left and right arguments could not be consistently distinguished. Such problems are avoided in the tensor product representational scheme, provided the relevant vector space notion of independence is respected.\\n\\nAn ICS activity vector cannot have more than one semantic interpretation. Could a vector have none? Indeed, it can. The representations are special vectors with semantic interpretations, those with tensor product form. Assuming a finite set of symbols, these form a discrete subset embedded in the continuous vector space of all activity patterns. The fact that many vectors have no semantic interpretation is analogous to the fact that in symbolic representational schemes, not all possible symbol structures have semantic interpretations. This topic will be revisited in section 4.3.2.\\n\\nAre the constituents in a tensor product representation really there? Addressing this question will occupy much of the rest of this chapter. There are contradictory intuitions to contend with. Since the individual constituents are superimposed when combined, they lose their individual identity in an intuitive sense. It might be objected that claiming 2 and 4 are constituents of 6 just because $2+4=6$ is misleading. However, the semantic interpretation process in ICS is unambiguous; while 6 could equally well be written as $5+1$, tensor product vectors cannot be semantically decomposed in more than one way due to the distinguished status of the vectors $\\\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}$.\\n\\nTo foreshadow an analogy, the decomposition of tensor products into constituents is more accurately mapped onto the decomposition of a Gödel number $2^{2} 3^{4}$ into its \\'constituents\\' 2 and 4. For an intuition that lends plausibility to the notion of vector constituents, consider the superposition of sound waves: the pressure wave encoding \"The Sounds of Silence\" is a superposition mixing the Simon and Garfunkel constituents, yet we believe those constituents are real. This example is a simplified version of many cleaner examples in physics where scientific explanation depends on decomposing waves into constituents superimposed like those in tensor product representations.\\n\\nIn this section, I have discussed the semantics of vectors in ICS in terms of propositions. This is just one way vectors are interpreted in ICS. In the work on grammar discussed in sections 2.3 and 3.3, tensor product representations are interpreted in terms of linguistic structures rather than propositions. In that context, the vector $\\\\mathbf{p}$ used as an example would be interpreted as the tree structure $p = [L,[S, K]]$ itself, rather than as a proposition like \"Sandy loves Kim\" denoted by $p$ in a symbolic system. Grammars are viewed as functions mapping symbolic input structures to symbolic output structures; these inputs and outputs are realized in ICS as tensor product representations, and connectionist processing computes outputs from inputs.\\n\\n### 2.2.2 Processing: Non-Algorithmic Structure\\n\\nA crucial test of the reality of the constituents of tensor product representations is whether it is possible for PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing) connectionist networks to process them in a structure-sensitive manner. This section demonstrates that it is indeed possible to design such networks while adhering to the principle of massively parallel processing. These networks display structure sensitivity without constituents having the causal role they have in Classical systems, where internal behavior is governed by algorithms operating over constituents. ICS networks achieve structure-sensitive processing, such as computing recursive functions, in a non-classical way that is difficult to grasp. To aid intuition, I will begin the discussion of the ICS explanation with two analogies; in the first, the numerical vectors forming the representational medium of ICS are replaced by a more familiar representational scheme using single numbers.',\n"," \"### 2.2.2.1 The Gödel Box: Paleoroboticists in an Alternate World\\n\\nIn an alternate world, paleoroboticists have discovered a mysterious black box. This box features a keypad, a display, several dials, a switch, and a small red light. After generations of graduate students have explored numerous hypotheses about the box, they have made a remarkable discovery. Seven keys on the keypad represent the digits 0-6, and an eighth key serves as an 'enter' key. A sequence of key presses can be interpreted as a numeral in base 7, representing a number. This number can be seen as the Gödel number of a binary tree with symbols at its nodes. Each symbol, denoted as \\\\(S_1, S_2, \\\\ldots\\\\), is coded by a number \\\\(k\\\\), and each possible position in the binary tree is coded by a prime number: the root node by \\\\(2 \\\\equiv p_0\\\\), its left child by \\\\(3 \\\\equiv p_{10}\\\\), the right child of the root by \\\\(5 \\\\equiv p_{11}\\\\), and so on. For example, the tree \\\\([S_3, [S_2, S_5]]\\\\) is encoded by the number \\\\(p_{10}^3 p_{110}^2 p_{111}^5 = 3^3 \\\\times 13^2 \\\\times 17^5\\\\). A series of key presses ending with the 'enter' key inputs a labeled binary tree into the Gödel box. The display then shows a code for another labeled binary tree, again using the base-7 code of a Gödel number, deciphered by the resourceful graduate students.\\n\\nThe students have determined that the input/output function computed by the box is a simple recursive function that rearranges the input tree in a specific way to generate the output tree. Different settings of the dials on the box lead it to compute different recursive functions. Flipping a switch on the box changes its mode; now, the tree encoded by the input key presses either causes the red light to illuminate or not. The students have discovered that the light turns on when the input tree is a valid parse tree of a formal language specified by a rewrite-rule grammar. Adjusting the dials changes the grammar.\\n\\nWith this triumph of descriptive generalization, the students seek to explain the remarkable behavior of the Gödel box. They propose that, in its first mode, the box takes the input Gödel number, extracts the encoded symbols, and places each into a memory register appropriately located in a binary tree data structure. It then recursively processes the tree to compute the recursive function, recombines the parts to create another tree data structure, and finally computes the Gödel number of the output tree, which it displays. In the second mode, the box starts similarly, extracting symbols and placing them in the tree data structure. It then checks whether the symbols at each node and their children match the left and right sides of a grammar rule. If all nodes match a rule, the light turns on; otherwise, it remains off.\\n\\nEventually, the students manage to open the box. To their shock, they discover that in the first mode, the Gödel box simply multiplies the input number by 3249049379387, subtracts 19384737, divides by 874987, takes the remainder, multiplies it by 108379174, and outputs the result. Adjusting the dials changes the numbers used in this computation. In the second mode, the calculation is similar, but if the resulting number is even, the red light turns on; if odd, it stays off.\\n\\nThis puzzle challenges several more generations of graduate students, this time in mathematics, until a new branch of number theory emerges. This branch is full of remarkable theorems about the relationship between powers of primes and arithmetic operations with certain combinations of numbers. These theorems prove that the computations performed in the box indeed execute recursive functions on Gödel numbers of labeled binary trees.\\n\\n### 2.2.2.2 The Visa Box\\n\\nInspired by the tale of the Gödel box, a friend of mine created a remarkable gift for me. She knows I dislike calculating tips in restaurants, as I rarely have more than $2.50 in cash and usually pay by Visa. I often receive slips showing only the 'sub-total'—the combined food bill and tax, with no breakdown. It goes against my principles to tip on tax, and figuring out the food bill portion for tipping is tedious. However, with my new Visa box, I can now enjoy dining out again. You set one dial to the local food tax rate, another to the desired tip rate, type in the sub-total from your bill, and the box calculates the total to write on the Visa slip. The servers can then back-compute their tip and fill it in for you.\\n\\nIt seemed obvious what happens inside the Visa box. First, it extracts the food bill from the sub-total using the tax-rate dial setting, then calculates the tax. With the food and tax separately stored, it applies the tip-rate dial setting to the food bill to determine the tip amount. It adds this to the food bill, then adds the tax, and displays the result.\\n\\nImagine my surprise when, one night, I opened the box and discovered it simply multiplies the input \\\\(i\\\\) by a number \\\\(m\\\\) and outputs the result \\\\(o\\\\):\\n\\\\[ o = wi \\\\]\\nWith the tax/tip-rate dials set at 10%/15%, for instance, it multiplies by 1.136. With the dials set at 7%/20%, it multiplies by 1.187. Through experimentation, I determined that the number it multiplies by is approximately \\\\( w = \\\\frac{100 + x + p}{100 + x} \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( p \\\\) are the tax and tip percentages, respectively. I pondered this and worked out the following explanation for why the Visa box gets the right answer:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& \\\\text{tax} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{100}\\\\right)(\\\\text{food}); \\\\quad \\\\text{tip} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{100}\\\\right)(\\\\text{food}); \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{sub-total} = (\\\\text{food}) + (\\\\text{tax}) \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\therefore \\\\text{sub-total} = (\\\\text{food}) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{100}\\\\right)(\\\\text{food}) = \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{x}{100}\\\\right)(\\\\text{food}) \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\therefore \\\\text{food} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{sub-total}}{1 + \\\\frac{x}{100}} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\therefore \\\\text{total} = (\\\\text{food}) + (\\\\text{tax}) + (\\\\text{tip}) \\\\\\\\\\n& = (\\\\text{food}) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{100}\\\\right)(\\\\text{food}) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{100}\\\\right)(\\\\text{food}) \\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{x}{100} + \\\\frac{p}{100}\\\\right)(\\\\text{food}) \\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{x}{100} + \\\\frac{p}{100}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{sub-total}}{1 + \\\\frac{x}{100}}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\frac{(100 + x + p)}{(100 + x)}(\\\\text{sub-total}) \\\\\\\\\\n& = w(\\\\text{sub-total})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nI marveled at my friend's ingenuity. As a final attempt to avoid finishing my paper, I pondered a philosophical question: are the food and tax really constituents of the Visa box's internal representation of the sub-total? If the machine worked as I initially expected, it would extract these constituents and manipulate them according to an obvious algorithm. But that isn't how it works. However, the question of why the box computes the correct total for all dial settings makes no sense without considering tax and food, as the semantics of the dials relate to these elements. The 'correct total' is defined in terms of tax and food, which must be part of the semantic characterization of the function the box computes and the explanation of its correct performance.\\n\\nHaving exhausted my distractions, I returned to finish my paper. The theoretical calculation at the heart of the Gödel box is hypothetical. However, it has a direct counterpart in ICS through tensor-theoretic calculations. The reason the former is impossible, while the latter is straightforward, is that representing complex structures in large vectors, as done in ICS, allows the structure to be accessible to simple operations, unlike when complex structures are encoded in a single number, as in the Gödel box. Surprisingly, the tensor-theoretic calculations of ICS are analogous to the simple arithmetic calculations in the Visa box. In short, ICS combines the rich structural semantics of the numbers manipulated in the Gödel box with the simple numerical operations of the Visa box by scaling up from single numbers to vectors.\\n\\nHere is a sketch of the explanation in the ICS case:\\n\\n**ICS Explanation of Structure-Sensitive Recursive Function Computation**\\n\\n1. The core connectionist processing operation is the multiplication of the input activity vector \\\\(i\\\\) by the matrix of connection strengths \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\); the output activity vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{o}\\\\) is then:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\mathrm{o} = \\\\mathrm{W} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\]\\n   where \\\\(\\\\cdot\\\\) denotes matrix multiplication.\\n\\n2. Extracting the left or right sub-tree of a tree is a matrix operation. If \\\\(\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\) is the vector realizing \\\\([\\\\mathrm{x}, \\\\mathrm{y}]\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\) are the vectors realizing the left and right sub-trees \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\), then there are two matrices \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1\\\\) such that:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\mathrm{x} = \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\mathrm{ex}}_0 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{s} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{y} = \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\mathrm{ex}}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{s} \\\\]\\n\\n3. Performing a sequence of two extraction operations—e.g., first extracting the right child of \\\\(s\\\\), getting \\\\(t\\\\), then extracting the left child of \\\\(t\\\\), getting \\\\(r\\\\)—produces the same result as successively multiplying \\\\(\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\) by a sequence of matrices:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\mathrm{t} = \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\mathrm{ex}}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{s} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\mathrm{ex}}_0 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{t} = \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\mathrm{ex}}_0 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\]\\n\\n   The matrix product of two matrices is another matrix, so \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\mathrm{ex}}_{01} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{s}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_{01}\\\\) is defined as the product \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_0 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\mathrm{ex}}_1\\\\). This can be recursively repeated to any depth. Thus, the extraction of any sub-constituent, no matter how deep in the tree, is achieved by multiplying a single appropriate matrix, which has a special structure: a product of a sequence of fundamental matrices \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1\\\\).\\n\\n4. Like the extraction of constituents from an existing tree, constructing new trees from existing constituents can be performed by simple matrix multiplications and additions, based on fundamental matrices \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}_1\\\\). Sequences of construction operations can be combined into a single matrix operation, and sequences of interleaved extraction and construction operations can also be combined.\\n\\n5. A single matrix multiplication of an input vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\) representing an arbitrarily complex tree \\\\(s\\\\) by a matrix \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\) to produce an output vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\) representing a tree \\\\(r\\\\) can compute a complex, structure-sensitive input/output function \\\\(f\\\\), which can also be characterized as the result of a sequence of extractions and recombination operations. Such a sequential algorithm characterizes the function \\\\(f\\\\) but not the means by which it is computed. The fact that this function \\\\(f\\\\) is correctly computed by multiplying by \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\) is explained by the fact that \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\) possesses a certain global structure: it is a product and sum of fundamental matrices \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_0, \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1, \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}_0\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}_1\\\\). This global form corresponds directly to the steps of the sequential algorithm. For example, the following pseudo-LISP expression describes a recursive function \\\\(f\\\\) that transforms structures of the 'English passive sentence' form \\\\(\\\\mathrm{s} = [\\\\mathrm{P}, [[\\\\text{aux}, \\\\mathrm{V}], [\\\\text{by}, \\\\mathrm{A}]]]\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\mathrm{P}, \\\\mathrm{V}\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathrm{A}\\\\) are arbitrarily complex subtrees) to the 'propositional form' \\\\([\\\\mathrm{V}, [\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathrm{P}]]\\\\):\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\begin{aligned}\\n   & f(\\\\mathrm{s}) = \\\\operatorname{cons}\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{ex}_1\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{ex}_0\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{ex}_1(\\\\mathrm{s})\\\\right)\\\\right), \\\\right. \\\\\\\\\\n   & \\\\left. \\\\operatorname{cons}\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{ex}_1\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{ex}_1\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{ex}_1(\\\\mathrm{s})\\\\right)\\\\right), \\\\operatorname{ex}_0(\\\\mathrm{s})\\\\right)\\\\right).\\n   \\\\end{aligned}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n   \\\\(f\\\\) is realized by the following weight matrix:\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\mathrm{W} = \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1 \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_0 \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1\\\\right] + \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}_1\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}_0\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1 \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1 \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_1\\\\right) + \\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{cons}}_1\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{W}^{\\\\text{ex}}_0\\\\right)\\\\right].\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. This multiplication by a single matrix \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\) can be performed by the simplest connectionist operation of spreading activation. Thus, we have networks that compute symbolic (recursive) functions, where we can prove that they do indeed correctly compute such functions, and therefore we can explain with complete precision how they do so—yet there is no symbolic algorithm operating on the constituents that governs the network. It is a simple one-step process, input vector to output vector, in which the equivalent of a complex set of extraction and construction operations on constituents are all performed simultaneously.\\n\\n7. Furthermore, the set of matrices \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\) (or the set of networks they define) that compute such recursive functions can be very simply characterized:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\mathbf{W} = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\]\\n   Here, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\) is a finite rearrangement weight matrix, which rearranges symbols within some finite depth of the tree; it contains a finite number of weights that achieve this rearrangement. The recursion matrix \\\\(\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\) is a fixed unbounded matrix with an extremely simple form (all its elements are either 0 or 1). \\\\(\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\) takes the finite number of elements in \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\) that govern rearrangements near the tree root and 'copies' them unboundedly to fill up \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\), creating a matrix that recursively propagates the same rearrangement to unbounded depth in the tree. The idealization to unboundedly deep trees through unbounded (or infinite) networks or \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\) matrices is immediate. The infinite behavior of recursive function evaluation is generated through the finite 'knowledge' \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\). In sum, the computation of recursive functions follows from the following principle:\\n\\n   **Alg\\\\(_{\\\\text{ics}}\\\\)(HC, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\)):** In core parts of higher cognitive domains, weight matrices have the form:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\mathbf{W} = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\]\\n   where \\\\(\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\) is a finite rearrangement weight matrix, and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\) is the recursion matrix.\\n\\nThe crucial difference between the ICS encoding of structure in tensor product vectors and the Gödel box encoding of structure in Gödel numbers lies in the fact that, in the former case, constituents can be accessed or stored using simple multiplication and addition (just as in the Visa box, but with matrices rather than single numbers); many such operations can be combined into a single operation of the same type. Thus, the structure that governs the function computed is not a structure over operations but a structure internal to the single operation. The structure resides in the space of matrices that operate on tensor product vectors and is an abstract structure governing the interrelation of all the connection weights.\\n\\nSince this step is crucial to the entire explanation, further details are too technical and involved to be appropriate here; the reader is referred to Smolensky et al. (1992) and the references therein.\\n\\nWe can now see how the PDP properties of distributed, parallel, and continuous processing are achieved in ICS. The representation is distributed: since the vectors realizing all the constituents in the structure are superimposed upon each other, each unit participates in the realization of many symbols. The processing is parallel: all the constituents in the input are simultaneously processed by multiplication by \\\\(\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\), which also creates all the constituents in the output simultaneously. Finally, the operations consist of numerical multiplication and addition, and these can be applied to any input vector in the space, not just the special discrete subset consisting of the vectors realizing symbolic structures.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is now clear that the principle of symbolic algorithms fails, making its negation the principle operative in ICS. The one-step matrix multiplication by which a recursive function is computed in ICS is in no sense a symbolic algorithm involving step-by-step extractions\",\n"," \"### 2.3 Language and Grammar\\n\\nDo tensor product representations truly possess syntactic structure? Are they capable of managing embedding and recursion? Given that recursive syntactic structures are prominently featured in formal language theory, one of the most precise ways to address these questions is to ask: Can tensor product representations be utilized in PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing) connectionist systems to capture formal languages? If so, to what extent within the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages? Can these systems encompass the entire hierarchy, thereby equating their generative power to that of Turing machines?\\n\\nIn this section, I present formal results demonstrating that the answer to the last question is affirmative. This necessitates the formulation of a theory of languages and grammars within the framework of ICS (Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic). The core concept in this theory is that of relative well-formedness, or Harmony. Well-formedness is a fundamental aspect of grammatical theory; in the context of a formal language, an absolute notion of well-formedness distinguishes strings that belong to the language (those for which a well-formed parse can be constructed according to grammatical rules) from those that do not. What is less apparent is that a notion of well-formedness—termed 'Harmony'—also plays a crucial role in connectionist theory. Surprisingly, by aligning connectionist well-formedness with linguistic well-formedness, a novel and highly effective approach to grammar can be developed.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection{2.3.1 Harmony of Activation Vectors}\\n\\nThe harmony of an activation vector in a connectionist network is a numerical measure of how well the vector adheres to the constraints encoded in the connection matrix. This section will primarily focus on explaining this concept.\\n\\nTo start, consider a negative connection with a weight of -0.8 from unit $\\\\alpha$ to unit $\\\\beta$. This connection implies that if unit $\\\\alpha$ is active, it inhibits unit $\\\\beta$, meaning $\\\\beta$ receives negative activation from $\\\\alpha$. This can be seen as a constraint: if $\\\\alpha$ is active, $\\\\beta$ should not be. The strength of this constraint is 0.8; if the weight were -8.0, the constraint would be ten times stronger. Conversely, unit $\\\\beta$ might also have a positive connection from another unit $\\\\gamma$, with a weight of +0.5. This connection suggests that if $\\\\gamma$ is active, $\\\\beta$ should be active too, with a constraint strength of 0.5. If both $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\gamma$ are active, $\\\\beta$ faces conflicting constraints, and the stronger one prevails: the negative activation from the -0.8 connection outweighs the positive activation from the +0.5 connection.\\n\\nRegarding the single connection from $\\\\alpha$ to $\\\\beta$, activity patterns can be evaluated based on how well they respect the corresponding constraint. Any pattern where both $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ are active—say, $\\\\mathrm{a}_{\\\\alpha}=+0.7$ and $\\\\mathrm{a}_{\\\\beta}=+0.4$—violates the constraint, resulting in negative harmony. The harmony is calculated as:\\n\\n$$\\nH_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}(\\\\mathrm{a})=\\\\mathrm{a}_{\\\\beta} \\\\mathrm{W}_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} \\\\mathrm{a}_{\\\\alpha}=(+0.4)(-0.8)(+0.7)=-0.224\\n$$\\n\\nThe harmony of an activity pattern with respect to a connection from $\\\\alpha$ to $\\\\beta$ is the product of the activation value of $\\\\beta$, the weight from $\\\\alpha$ to $\\\\beta$, and the activation value of $\\\\alpha$. If the weight is negative and both activations are positive, the result is negative, indicating a constraint violation. The stronger the connection and the higher the activations, the more negative the harmony.\\n\\nNow, suppose in pattern $\\\\mathrm{a}$, the activation value of unit $\\\\gamma$ is +0.7. This pattern satisfies the constraint from the +0.5 connection to $\\\\beta$ from $\\\\gamma$, resulting in positive harmony:\\n\\n$$\\nH_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma}(\\\\mathrm{a})=\\\\mathrm{a}_{\\\\beta} \\\\mathrm{W}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\mathrm{a}_{\\\\gamma}=(+0.4)(+0.5)(+0.7)=+0.140\\n$$\\n\\nThe net harmony of $\\\\mathrm{a}$ with respect to both connections is the sum of the individual harmony values:\\n\\n$$\\nH_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}(\\\\mathrm{a})+H_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma}(\\\\mathrm{a})=(-0.224)+(+0.14)=-0.174\\n$$\\n\\nThis negative result indicates that while the weaker constraint is satisfied, the stronger one is violated, leading to a net violation. This outcome is due to the way harmony values are calculated.\\n\\nConsider another pattern $a^{\\\\prime}$, identical to $\\\\mathrm{a}$ except that the activation value of $\\\\beta$ is negative: $a^{\\\\prime}_{\\\\beta}=-0.4$. This pattern violates the weaker constraint but satisfies the stronger one. Reversing the sign of $a_{\\\\beta}$ to $a^{\\\\prime}_{\\\\beta}$ reverses the harmony values, making $H(a^{\\\\prime})$ positive (+0.174). Pattern $a^{\\\\prime}$ is more well-formed with respect to these connections, conforming better to the constraints. The activation flow into $\\\\beta$ from both $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\gamma$ would inhibit $\\\\beta, not excite it, leading to pattern $a^{\\\\prime}$ rather than $\\\\mathrm{a}$. The result of activation flow depends on the network's activation spread rules; however, in typical networks, spreading activation creates a pattern with maximal harmony, best satisfying the constraints. Activation spread is a process of parallel soft-constraint satisfaction, where constraints can be overruled and violated, but at a cost: reduced harmony.\\n\\nThis concept of activation spreading as parallel soft-constraint satisfaction, or harmony maximization, applies to the entire network's connections. The total harmony of a pattern $\\\\mathrm{a}$ in a network with connection weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ is the sum of harmony values for all connections:\\n\\n$$\\nH(\\\\mathbf{a})=\\\\Sigma_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} H_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}=\\\\Sigma_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} a_{\\\\beta} \\\\mathrm{W}_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha} a_{\\\\alpha}=\\\\mathrm{a}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}\\n$$\\n\\nHere, $\\\\Sigma_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}$ means summing over all unit pairs $\\\\beta, \\\\alpha$, and the last expression uses vector/matrix multiplication. This method of deriving a number, $H(\\\\mathbf{a})$, from a vector $\\\\mathrm{a}$ and a matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ is common in vector space theory.\\n\\nThe concept of harmony is crucial in PDP computation theory, leading to a theorem on harmony maximization. Before stating this result, we need to describe the computation in PDP models. An input vector $\\\\mathbf{i}$ is imposed on input units, remaining unchanged during computation. Activation flows from input units to others, eventually settling, so the overall activation vector $\\\\mathrm{a}$ no longer changes. The input vector $\\\\mathbf{i}$ is part of the total activation vector $\\\\mathrm{a}$, as input units are part of the network's unit population. We can view different networks as completing $\\\\mathbf{i}$ in various ways. Part of the total activation vector $\\\\mathrm{a}$ is the output vector $\\\\mathbf{o}$, listing output unit activity values. Thus, as the network computes a completion $\\\\mathrm{a}$ of an input $\\\\mathbf{i}$, it maps the input $\\\\mathbf{i}$ to a corresponding output $\\\\mathbf{o}$; this mapping is the function $f$ computed by the network.\\n\\nWe need to define a central class of PDP networks:\\n\\n(48) Harmonic Nets (Definition): A PDP network is harmonic if it has the following properties:\\n(a) Activation Rule: If the total activation flowing into a unit is positive, the activation will increase (or stay the same); if negative, it will decrease.\\n(b) Connectivity: The connectivity pattern is either feedforward (no closed loops) or symmetrical feedback ($\\\\mathrm{w}_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}=\\\\mathrm{w}_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}$; the connection weight to $\\\\beta$ from $\\\\alpha$ equals that to $\\\\alpha$ from $\\\\beta$).\\n(c) Updating: Units change their activation values one at a time, or they change their activity by a very small amount at each update (ideally, continuously in time).\\n\\nNow we can state the result:\\n\\n(49) Harmony Maximization (Theorem): In harmonic nets, at each moment of processing, the harmony of the total activation vector increases (or stays the same). Furthermore, for a wide range of activation rules, the activation settles to a final vector that maximizes $H(\\\\mathbf{a})$ among the vectors $\\\\mathrm{a}$ that are completions of the input $\\\\mathbf{i}$.\\n\\nHarmony maximization is fundamental to ICS because it allows reasoning at a higher level of analysis than individual units, connections, activation rules, and update rules. Harmony maximization encapsulates this complexity into a simple yet powerful principle, refining the basic principle (1):\\n\\n(50) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$: In all cognitive domains, cognitive processes are spreading activation algorithms $(=28=1)$...\\n\\n(51) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$: A core class of these algorithms operates in harmonic nets...\\n\\n(52) $\\\\operatorname{Fun}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$: These algorithms perform parallel soft-constraint satisfaction, completing input activation vectors to total activation vectors that maximize harmony. $(=49: \\\\text{principle of harmony maximization})^{31}$\\n\\nAs we have seen, (52) is a logical consequence of (51), not an independent hypothesis. The ability to derive the principle $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\mathrm{pdp}}(H)$ governing the functions computed is a primary motivation for hypothesizing that $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$ applies to the algorithms performing the computation.\",\n"," \"### 2.3.2 Harmony of Symbol Structures: Harmonic Grammar\\n\\nThe significance of the processing assumption $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$ lies in its ability to integrate Connectionist principles into higher-level analyses. In advanced cognitive domains, the representational assumption (39) Rep $_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$ is applicable: the vectors of interest are structured as tensor product representations. What are the implications of having both harmony maximization and tensor product representation as higher-level principles? The mathematical outcomes are surprisingly straightforward:\\n\\n(53) $\\\\mathrm{Wf}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$ (Theorem): Suppose $a$ is a tensor product vector representing a symbolic structure $s$ with constituents $\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}$, as per $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})(39)$.\\n\\n(a) The harmony of this representation is:\\n\\n$$\\nH(\\\\mathbf{s}) \\\\equiv H(\\\\mathbf{a}) = \\\\sum_{i j} H\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\n(b) Alternatively, the harmony of $s$ can be calculated using the following rules:\\n\\n$R_{i j}$: If $s$ contains the constituents $\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}$ and $\\\\mathrm{c}_{j}$ simultaneously, add the numerical value $H\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)$ to $H$.\\n\\nEach $R_{i j}$ is termed a soft rule, and the collection of these rules forms a Harmonic Grammar. To determine the Harmony of a structure $s$, identify all applicable rules $R_{i j}$ and sum up the corresponding Harmony contributions $H\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)$.\\n\\n(c) Soft rules can also be interpreted as soft constraints. If $H(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j})$ is negative $-s_{i j}$, then $R_{i j}$ is seen as a negative constraint:\\n\\n$C_{i j}$: $s$ should not contain the constituents $\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}$ simultaneously (strength: $s_{i j}$).\\n\\nIf $H\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)$ is positive $+s_{i j}$, then $R_{i j}$ corresponds to a positive constraint:\\n\\n$C_{i j}$: $s$ should contain the constituents $\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}$ simultaneously (strength: $s_{i j}$). $H(s)$ is computed by adding the strengths of all satisfied positive constraints and subtracting the strengths of all violated negative constraints.\\n\\n(d) At the connectionist network level, each Harmony contribution $H\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)$ measures how well the pair of vectors $\\\\mathbf{c}_{i}, \\\\mathbf{c}_{j}$ conform to the soft constraints encoded in the weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$; it can be calculated as:\\n\\n$$\\nH\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{c}_{i}, \\\\mathbf{c}_{j}\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}\\\\right)_{\\\\beta} \\\\mathrm{W}_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha}\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)_{\\\\alpha}\\n$$\\n\\nTo illustrate soft rules, consider a conventional phrase structure rewrite grammar rule:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nS \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{NP VP} \\\\tag{54}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nTwo corresponding soft rules, informally stated, are:\\n\\n(a) $R_{\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{NP}}$: If $S$ contains a constituent labeled $S$ and its left subconstituent is labeled NP, add +2 to $H$.\\n\\n(b) $R_{\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{VP}}$: If $s$ contains a constituent labeled $S$ and its right subconstituent is labeled VP, add +2 to $H$.\\n\\nThese rules clearly instantiate the general soft-rule schema for $R_{i, j}$. In (55a), for example, the constituent $\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}$ is an $S$ at some node in the parse tree, while the second constituent $\\\\mathrm{c}_{j}$ is an NP at a node which is the left child node of the $S$. The harmony contribution from this pair, $H\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)$, is +2; the positive value indicates that this pair of constituents is well-formed according to the grammar.\\n\\nPrinciple (53) $\\\\mathrm{Wf}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$ determines how the Harmony of a symbolic structure (e.g., a parse tree) $s$ is computed in terms of its symbolic constituents. The computation is straightforward if the quantities $H\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{c}_{i}, \\\\mathrm{c}_{j}\\\\right)$ are known; in that case, no reference to the connectionist level of activation vectors and weight matrices is required: the entire computation can be performed based on the symbolic constituents alone. To apply the rules $R_{\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{NP}}$ and $R_{\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{VP}}$ (55), we only need to know the location of $S$, NP, and VP labels in a parse tree: we need not know about the activity vectors used to realize these constituents or the connections used to process them, except for what is encapsulated in (55): that the aggregate effect of all relevant activations and weights is to assign a Harmony of +2 to these arrangements of constituents in a structure.\\n\\nGiven the ability to assess the Harmony of any symbol structure, as provided by principle (53) $\\\\mathrm{Wf}_{\\\\mathrm{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$, it is now straightforward (in principle) to determine the functioning of the grammar: apply principle $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$ as follows. Imagine the network receives a string of symbols, encoded as an input vector $i$, which it must parse according to its Harmonic Grammar. According to $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$, the net effect of the processing in the network is to complete this input vector into a total pattern of activity $a$ which has maximum Harmony. This vector $a$ is the parse of the input $\\\\mathbf{i}$ according to the grammar encoded in the network's connections $\\\\mathbf{W}$. That is, we have the following symbolic version of Fun $_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$:\\n\\n(56) $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{H})$: Given an input symbolic structure $i$, the harmonic grammar assigns to $i$ the output symbolic structure ('parse') $s$ with maximal Harmony, among those which are completions of $i$. The higher the value of Harmony of this parse structure $s$, the more well-formed the grammar judges the input ($=49$: Harmony maximization).\\n\\nThe input is always part of the parse structure. For phrase structure grammars (context-free grammars), the parse is a tree whose terminal symbols give the input string, and whose structure shows how the input symbols are grouped into constituent phrases. For formal grammars, we can arbitrarily impose a cut-off of acceptable Harmony for the parse in order for an input string to be judged sufficiently well-formed by the grammar to be admitted into the language. For instance, we may choose a cut-off of 0: inputs assigned parses with negative Harmony are then not in the formal language, while those with non-negative Harmony are.\\n\\nThe apparent simplicity of Harmonic Grammar might suggest it is a weak concept. Only pairs of constituents are examined, each pair is assigned a number, and these numbers are simply summed. Interactions might seem weak. However, this expectation is demonstrably false.\\n\\n(57) $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{CFL})$ (Theorem): Any context-free language can be specified by a Harmonic Grammar.\\n\\nThe proof of this theorem is beyond our current scope; it can be found in Smolensky et al. (1992, s. 3.1.2). The proof's idea is simple: context-free rewrite rules like (54) are replaced by harmonic grammar soft rules like (55), which provide positive Harmony for legal dominations (constituent/sub-constituent relations); simultaneously, a carefully designed set of rules like:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nR_{\\\\mathrm{S}}: \\\\text{If } \\\\mathrm{s} \\\\text{ contains a constituent } \\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\text{ add } -3 \\\\text{ to } H(\\\\mathrm{s}) \\\\tag{58}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nassess negative Harmony for all symbols (like $S$) which occur in the parse tree. The negative Harmony values in rules like (58) are designed so that if the symbol has a legal parent in the tree, and the full number of required legal children, then its negative Harmony will be just canceled by the positive Harmony arising from all these legal dominations. The net result is that well-formed parse trees have 0 Harmony, while all other structures have negative Harmony: so the formal language is, as required, all and only those input symbol strings whose maximum Harmony parse tree has non-negative (indeed 0) Harmony.\\n\\nExtending theorem (57) from context-free grammars to unrestricted grammars is straightforward; the only complication is that parse structures are no longer simply trees, but more complex symbolic structures whose realization in tensor products has not yet been attempted; I know of no reason to expect any difficulties, however, given the utter generality of the tensor product technique for representing arbitrary symbolic structures. As far as harmonic grammars at the symbolic level are concerned, however, there is no doubt: for any rewrite rule grammar, there is a corresponding Harmonic Grammar that generates the same formal language (Smolensky et al., 1992, p. 28).\\n\\nUnrestricted grammars are the formal-language equivalents of Turing machines: the former is at the top of the Chomsky language hierarchy and the latter at the top of the automaton hierarchy. Thus, the computational abstraction provided by ICS, Harmonic Grammars, is as powerful as Turing machines. In this sense, at least, the goal of realizing the power of symbolic computation in a PDP model has been achieved.\\n\\nTo avoid misunderstanding this claim, it is important to make a competence/performance distinction for ICS—different in important respects from Classical competence/performance distinctions, but sharing enough central properties to justify the name.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{2.3.3 Competence and Performance Distinction}\\n\\nThe competence/performance distinction in ICS hinges on the difference between an input/output function and an algorithm for computing that function. This distinction is highlighted by the labels: (51) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\mathrm{pdp}}(H)$ for algorithms, and (52) $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\mathrm{pdp}}(H)$ for functions, with a specific case for higher cognition, (56) Fun ${ }_{\\\\text {ics }}(H)$. A Harmonic Grammar defines an input/output function through an optimization approach: the output is the completion of the input that maximizes the Harmony function, making it 'optimal' or most well-formed according to the grammar.\\n\\nThe challenge lies in computing or constructing this optimal output, a task for a parsing algorithm. Grammars themselves do not compute; they are functions that abstractly specify the correct output/parse/structural description for any input. Harmonic Grammar achieves this through optimization, a method derived from underlying connectionist processing. Fun ${ }_{\\\\text {pdp }}(H)$ results from $\\\\mathbf{A l g}_{\\\\text {pdp }}(H)$ via the Harmony maximization theorem (49). Thus, algorithms from harmonic nets (48) can compute the functions required by Harmonic Grammars, though practical experience is limited. A gap exists between the connectionist algorithms of $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\mathrm{pdp}}(H)$ and the Harmonic Grammars of $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\mathrm{pdp}}(H)$ that needs examination.\\n\\nOptimization theory differentiates between local and global optima. A local optimum is a solution better than any of its 'neighbors', relative to a concept of 'neighborhood' in the solution space. In the PDP context, a local Harmony maximum is an activation vector where any small change in unit activation reduces the Harmony of the activity pattern. A global optimum is a solution superior to all alternatives. Thus, a local Harmony maximum may not be a global maximum if significant changes in activations could yield a higher Harmony pattern.\\n\\nComputing the global maximum of harmony functions is computationally intractable. Neither connectionist networks nor any known algorithm can efficiently solve this problem for arbitrary Harmony functions (arbitrary weight matrices or sets of soft rules in a Harmonic Grammar). The Harmony maximization theorem (49) holds in two senses. First, harmonic nets compute local Harmony maxima, true for many activation functions. For some special functions, a further result holds: there is a limit, idealizing away from efficiency, where the global maximum is computed. For instance, the spreading activation algorithm in Harmony Theory (Smolensky, 1986a), also known as 'simulated annealing', is a probabilistic algorithm where the probability of computing the global maximum approaches 1 as processing time increases indefinitely.\\n\\nIn Harmonic Grammar, the Harmony maximum is the global maximum; as currently formulated, there is no concept of 'neighboring' parses or 'local maximum'. The function specified by a Harmonic Grammar according to $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\text {ics }}(H)$ represents grammatical competence. A gap exists between this and parsing algorithms governed by $\\\\mathrm{Alg}_{\\\\text {pdp }}(H)$, which model linguistic performance. If rapid computation is needed, algorithms compute local Harmony maxima rather than global ones, leading to deviations from competence theory that remain unexplored. Conversely, an idealized 'perfect grammar-using network' with unlimited time computes the global maximum, aligning the PDP algorithm modeling performance with the function specifying competence.\\n\\nA second idealization was discussed in section 2.2.2.3 regarding productivity. Recursive tensor product representations in ICS achieve unambiguous symbolic structure realization, but require sufficiently large networks to handle the size of symbol structures. In the idealization of infinite productivity—evaluating unboundedly large trees, long sentences, and deep recursion—unboundedly large networks are necessary. As explained in (46), this idealization is easily accommodated in ICS: these unboundedly large networks are finitely specified without issue.\",\n"," \"### 2.3.4 On the Psychological Reality of Harmonic Grammar Rules\\n\\nWe now return to the primary focus of this chapter: constituent structure and the explanatory and causal roles of constituents. In some sense, the rules of a grammar are 'constituents' of mental knowledge. It is intriguing to consider whether these rules play essential roles in cognitive explanation and whether they are part of the algorithms that generate cognitive behavior. These questions relate to the 'psychological reality' of grammar rules, a topic of enduring interest in cognitive science.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider explanation. The theorem on formal languages (57) is proven entirely through the analysis of soft rule sets. In this proof, individual rules play distinct and indispensable roles. Moreover, the infinite, recursive nature of formal languages is central to the general issue of productivity. Harmonic Grammar thus provides further evidence that explanations of productivity are both possible and robust within the framework of ICS. Indeed, in the following section, we will see that Harmonic Grammar has led to advancements in linguistic theory, enhancing the explanatory power of the theory of human language grammar. The explanatory power of soft rules in Harmonic Grammar is significant.\\n\\nHowever, when considering causal roles and algorithms, we must reach the same conclusion for rules as knowledge constituents as we did for symbols as representation constituents. These rules do not feature in symbolic algorithms for linguistic performance in ICS. These algorithms are massively parallel PDP activation-spreading algorithms, defined over units and connections. Each Harmonic Grammar rule corresponds to a widely distributed pattern of connections, which also contribute to the realization of many other rules. An algorithmic description of this connectionist Harmony-maximization process is currently impossible. The processing involves constructing the output parse structure in a continuous, non-discrete manner, in parallel across the entire structure, satisfying all the constraints in the Harmonic Grammar simultaneously. The conclusion, once again, is that there are no symbolic algorithms describing ICS processing: $\\\\mathrm{Alg}_{\\\\text {sym }}$ (7) fails, and its negation $\\\\mathrm{Alg}_{\\\\text {ics }}(9)$ holds.\\n\\nThese observations are largely speculative at present, as experience with such algorithms is minimal. Much more research at the algorithmic level is necessary before a definitive assessment can be made.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{3.1 The Principles of ICS}\\n\\n**Representation**\\n\\n(59) $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\mathrm{pdp}}$: Some essential structures in connectionist networks do not originate from learning. $(=8)$\\n\\nIn the core areas of higher cognitive domains, representations are vectors structured as recursive tensor product representations.\\n\\n(60) $\\\\text{Nativism}_{\\\\text{ics}}$: Some essential structures in connectionist networks do not originate from learning. $(=8)$\\n\\n(61) $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$: In the core areas of higher cognitive domains, representations are vectors structured as recursive tensor product representations. $(=39)$\\n\\n(62) $\\\\therefore \\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$: In the core areas of higher cognitive domains, representations are symbolic structures. $(=3)$\\n\\n(63) $\\\\mathrm{Sem}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$: The semantic interpretation of these symbolic representations is compositionally derived from their syntactic structure. $(=4)$\\n\\n**Processing**\\n\\n(64) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}$: In all cognitive domains, representations are distributed patterns of activity. $(=2)$\\n\\nIn all cognitive domains, cognitive processes are spreading activation algorithms, the core operation of which is the multiplication of an input activation vector $\\\\mathbf{i}$ by a weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ to produce the output vector: $\\\\mathbf{o} = \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{i}$. $(=29)$\\n\\n(66) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC}, \\\\mathrm{W})$: In the core areas of higher cognitive domains, weight matrices have the form: $\\\\mathbf{W} = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{R}^{\\\\prime}$, where $\\\\mathbf{w}$ is a finite rearrangement matrix, and $\\\\mathbf{R}$ is the recursion matrix. $(=46)$\\n\\n(67) $\\\\therefore \\\\text{Fun}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$: In the core areas of higher cognitive domains, the input/output functions computed by cognitive processes are described by (recursive) symbolic functions. $(=5)$\\n\\n(68) $\\\\operatorname{Alg}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$:\\n\\n(69) $\\\\therefore \\\\operatorname{Fun}_{\\\\text{pdp}}(H)$:\\n\\n(70) $\\\\therefore \\\\text{Fun}_{\\\\text{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC}, H)$: Given an input symbolic structure $i$, the Harmonic Grammar assigns to $i$ the output symbolic structure ('parse') $s$ with maximal Harmony, among those which are completions of $i$.

We will revisit this logical structure when discussing the goal of reduction (11) in section 4.\",\n"," '\\\\subsection*{3.2 Status of the FEP Properties in the ICS Architecture}\\n\\nWe will first examine the properties related to representation, followed by those concerning processing.\\n\\n**3.2.1 Representations: Systematicity and Compositionality**\\n\\nA notable consequence of the ICS principles, which has not yet been discussed, is:\\n\\n(73) **Systematicity (HC) (Theorem):** In core areas of higher cognitive domains, the set of possible representations forms a systematic set. For instance, if it is possible to represent the proposition $p$ as in \"Sandy loves Kim,\" then it is also possible to represent the proposition $p^{\\\\prime}$ as in \"Kim loves Sandy.\"\\n\\nThis is unsurprising, as at a higher level of description, the representations of these propositions in ICS are the symbolic forms $\\\\mathrm{p} \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K})$ and $\\\\mathrm{p}^{\\\\prime} \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\mathrm{K}, \\\\mathrm{S})$. Systematicity is a corollary of the fact that ICS realizes symbolic representations $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$ (62) in higher cognitive domains. However, it is beneficial to demonstrate this result explicitly.\\n\\nAccording to $\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\mathrm{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$ (61), in ICS, higher cognitive representations take the form of tensor product representations, which derive their semantics compositionally, following $\\\\operatorname{Sem}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$. As detailed in section 2.2.1.2.1, the proposition $p$ of (73) is represented by the vector (34):\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{L} + \\\\mathrm{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\left[\\\\mathrm{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\mathrm{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{K}\\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nThis realizes $p = \\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}) \\\\equiv [\\\\mathrm{L}, [\\\\mathrm{S}, \\\\mathrm{K}]]$. For a cognitive system to represent $p$, it must have vectors $L$, $\\\\mathbf{S}$, and K to construct $\\\\mathbf{p}$. Consequently, the representational vector space must also include the vector:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{p}^{\\\\prime} \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{L} + \\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{r}_{0} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\mathbf{r}_{1} \\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{S}\\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nThis realizes $\\\\mathrm{p}^{\\\\prime} = \\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\mathrm{K}, \\\\mathrm{S}) \\\\equiv [\\\\mathrm{L}, [\\\\mathrm{K}, \\\\mathrm{S}]]$ and represents the proposition $p^{\\\\prime}$. This example demonstrates that the space of tensor product vectorial representations has the same systematic structure as Classical symbol systems. Without this, tensor product vectors could not realize symbol structures.\\n\\nWhile systematicity (HC) results from fundamental ICS principles, the compositionality of semantics in higher cognitive domains is assumed: $\\\\operatorname{Sem}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$ (63). This will be further discussed in section 4.3.2.\\n\\n**3.2.2 Processes: Productivity and Inferential Coherence**\\n\\nA comprehensive account of general inference, including the property F\\\\&P call \\'inferential coherence,\\' remains an open problem for ICS and PDP modeling. There is little to add at this point; a few comparisons to the Classical account will be provided in section 4.1.1.2.\\n\\nAmong all the F\\\\&P properties, productivity has been most central to the development of ICS due to its fundamental role in cognitive science (as discussed in section 2.2.1.1). In ICS, the productivity of higher cognition logically follows from more basic principles, leading to two general characterizations of productivity. The first is $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\text{sym}}(\\\\mathrm{HC})$ (67), which asserts that recursive functions are computed; the explanation of this derivation was covered in section 2.2.2.3. The second result was $\\\\mathrm{Fun}_{\\\\mathrm{ics}}(\\\\mathrm{HC}, H)$ (70), which states that recursive formal languages can be specified by the grammar formalism, Harmonic Grammar, derived from fundamental ICS principles. The role of Harmonic Grammar rules was discussed in section 2.3.4.\\n\\nTwo major points have been made about explaining productivity in ICS. First, such an explanation was not previously possible within PDP models, as opposed to local connectionist networks (section 2.1.1). The use of PDP in ICS, rather than local connectionism, has significant computational consequences and an important foundational implication: the ICS explanation of productivity is non-Classical. Constituents in ICS do not play causal roles in symbolic algorithms for generating productive behavior. The paradox resolved by ICS is how constituents can fail to play such roles while still explaining productivity. As detailed in section 2.2.2.3, the key observation is that processing systems may possess structures other than those constituting symbolic algorithms. Certain abstract (tensor product) structures in activity and connection patterns explain productivity in ICS, with constituents integral to this structure. However, the algorithms responsible for generating behavior operate over their micro-structure, not these constituents; no symbolic algorithm manipulates these constituents, and no explanation based on such manipulations is possible.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{3.3 Generative Grammar}\\n\\nThe evaluation of a proposed cognitive architecture like ICS requires thorough examination across multiple dimensions, many of which have yet to be fully explored. Beyond the computational and foundational considerations discussed in sections 2 and 3.2, ICS has also been tested in a more empirical domain closely aligned with classical architecture: the theory of grammar, understood as knowledge of human language.\\n\\nIn section 2.3, we addressed computational issues related to language and grammar, applying the principles of Harmonic Grammar to formal languages, typically considered part of computational theory. Harmonic Grammar has also been applied to natural language, leading to new insights and developments in generative grammar, which are briefly discussed in this section.\\n\\nHarmonic Grammar posits that grammars consist of simultaneous, conflicting, soft constraints, with conflicts resolved through a notion of relative strength. This approach diverges from certain classical conceptions of grammar in two key ways: the simultaneous satisfaction of constraints and the idea that these constraints are soft.\\n\\nChomsky's early work on natural language grammar followed the model of formal grammars, defining a language through strings generated by sequential string-rewriting rules (phrase structure rules and transformations). In our discussion of formal languages in section 2.3, we demonstrated how to reinterpret this notion of sequential rewriting using a Harmonic Grammar of simultaneous constraints. This shift, from viewing grammar as a set of operations in a sequential algorithm to seeing it as a set of simultaneous well-formedness constraints, occurred in generative grammar research on syntactic theory about 15 years ago. It is widely regarded as a significant advancement in syntactic theory, greatly enhancing the explanatory power of generative grammar.\\n\\nIn the context of modern generative syntax, the first element of the Harmonic Grammar conception is not revolutionary: the output assigned by a grammar to an input is not the result of a grammatically specified sequential algorithm but rather the completion of the input that simultaneously satisfies a set of grammatically specified constraints. However, the second element of Harmonic Grammar is novel: the idea that the constraints are 'soft'—they are conflicting, so many are often violated in the legal structures of the language, with conflicts resolved by a notion of relative strength.\\n\\nThe power of this second element, soft constraints, to handle complex constraint interactions in natural language was demonstrated in research on French syntax. A significant area of research in generative grammar is split intransitivity, where different intransitive verbs exhibit different patterns in various syntactic and semantic respects. Researchers have been divided on whether the constraints explaining these phenomena are syntactic or semantic. These phenomena are largely governed by tendencies that have not been successfully captured through hard constraints. French split intransitivity phenomena present a particularly challenging pattern of grammaticality judgments. In our Harmonic Grammar account, we demonstrated that this complex pattern could be explained by a set of soft constraints, some syntactic, some semantic, and some involving syntactic/semantic compatibility (see Smolensky et al. 1992, s. 3.1.5 and Appendix, and references therein).\\n\\nThe history of the phonological component of generative grammar has differed from that of the syntactic component in relevant respects. In syntax, the transition from conceiving a grammar as a sequential rewrite rule algorithm to viewing it as a set of parallel constraints significantly advanced the theory's explanatory power. However, in phonology, this transition has been more problematic. The sequential-algorithm conception remains dominant, with constraints lingering at the theory's margins, resistant to attempts to elevate them to the core. Harmonic Grammar is providing a significant instrument of change in this picture. It now appears that successfully shifting to a constraint-based conception of grammar in phonology depends crucially on having a formal framework of soft constraints.\\n\\nPhonological applications of Harmonic Grammar led Alan Prince and me to a remarkable discovery: in a broad set of cases, the relative strengths of constraints need not be specified numerically. If the numerically weighted constraints needed in these cases are ranked from strongest to weakest, it turns out that each constraint is stronger than all the weaker constraints combined. This means the numerical strengths are arranged so that each constraint can never be overruled by weaker constraints, no matter how many. This led to a non-numerical successor to Harmonic Grammar, Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993), in which constraints are arranged in strict dominance hierarchies, each constraint strictly stronger than all the lower-ranked constraints (even when combined). In various areas of phonology, Optimality Theory has, for the first time, made it possible to shift the formal framework of grammar completely away from that of a symbolic algorithm to one of simultaneous soft-constraint satisfaction. The increased explanatory power is sometimes dramatic, significantly strengthening the theory of Universal Grammar.\\n\\nFor example, it becomes possible to identify a set of conflicting phonological constraints shared by all languages, forming part of Universal Grammar. Individual grammars rank these universal constraints differently in their language-specific dominance hierarchies, so the conflicts among the universal constraints are resolved differently in different languages. This often results in very different surface patterns across languages, but these can now be explained as arising from a common set of constraints. By analyzing the results of ranking the universal constraints in all possible dominance hierarchies, it becomes possible to deduce predictions and explanations of which patterns are and are not possible in human languages. This approach to explaining typological variation has been carried out both within phonology (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) and within morphosyntax (Legendre et al. 1993).\\n\\nOptimality Theory can be seen as resolving an artifact within generative grammar that is a relic of its classical origins. The idea of a universal set of well-formedness conditions has a long history in linguistics, much of it characterized in terms of tendencies or markedness. Markedness is a notion of relative well-formedness that pervades informal linguistic theory but has never been successfully adopted as a core concept at the center of a formal theory. This is largely because it is fundamentally out of place in a formalism where a grammar is a sequential algorithm for constructing an output from an input. Harmonic Grammar, on the other hand, is a formal theory of markedness or can be interpreted as such. By freeing linguistic theory from the demands of algorithm construction, Harmonic Grammar and Optimality Theory allow markedness-type notions to claim center stage; indeed, these now become the grammar.\\n\\nOptimality Theory is a contribution to symbolic generative grammar that ICS facilitates by allowing central concepts from PDP computation—parallel soft-constraint satisfaction—to rise from the lower level and constructively engage with linguistic theories of symbolic representation.\",\n"," '\\\\subsection*{4.1 The Necessity Objection}\\n\\nF\\\\&P present the following argument:\\n\\n(74) The Necessity Objection to Connectionism: While a connectionist network can indeed be configured to align with the F\\\\&P properties, it can also be configured not to possess these properties. Therefore, the connectionist architecture cannot inherently explain why a cognitive system must possess these properties, whereas the classical architecture can.\\n\\nIn this section, we evaluate this objection and demonstrate that, in the context of ICS, it is unfounded. By this criterion, the classical account is equally stipulative and lacks explanatory power.\\n\\nFirstly, as discussed in Section 2.1.1, the initial phrase \"of course\" in the necessity objection reveals a fundamental misunderstanding. As previously noted, while it is relatively straightforward to configure local connectionist networks to perform symbolic computation and thereby exhibit the F\\\\&P properties, within the class of connectionist networks most frequently considered as a potential cognitive architecture—namely, PDP models—the opposite assumption is more appropriate: that configuring them to display anything beyond simple associationism is not feasible. Therefore, when evaluating PDP models, we must first address:\\n\\n(75) The Sufficiency Objection to Connectionism: A connectionist network cannot be configured to align with the F\\\\&P properties because connectionist networks inherently possess unstructured representations and perform statistical association rather than structure-sensitive processing.\\n\\nOnly after PDP has evolved into ICS, as outlined in Sections 2-3, can the sufficiency objection be set aside, allowing the necessity objection to be given serious consideration.\\n\\n4.1.1 Necessity of the FESP Properties in the Classical Architecture\\n\\nTo compare the level of explanation regarding the \\'necessity\\' of the F\\\\&P properties in ICS and the classical theory, let\\'s begin by reviewing the classical principles that have already been presented.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Principles of Classical Architecture}\\n\\n1. **Symbolic Representation in Higher Cognition**: In the core areas of higher cognitive domains, representations are structured as symbolic entities. \\n\\n2. **Semantic Interpretation**: The meaning of these symbolic representations is derived compositionally from their syntactic structure.\\n\\n3. **Symbolic Algorithms**: Higher cognitive processes are described using symbolic algorithms.\\n\\n4. **Symbolic Functions**: In the core areas of higher cognitive domains, the input/output functions computed by cognitive processes are described by recursive symbolic functions.\\n\\nWhile the third principle is explicitly rejected in ICS, the other three principles are also applicable within the ICS framework.\\n\\n### Systematicity and Compositionality\\n\\nThe principle of symbolic representation does not inherently guarantee systematicity. The presence of one symbol structure does not imply the presence of another. A stronger version of the symbolic representation principle is required to account for systematicity: the set of representations must form a symbol system. Systematicity is a fundamental aspect of a symbol system, and the Classical theory assumes it rather than deriving it from more basic principles. The necessity of systematicity is not explained by the Classical theory; it is merely described.\\n\\nCompositionality is assumed in both the Classical and ICS theories, with neither providing a detailed explanation.\\n\\n### Productivity and Inferential Coherence\\n\\nIn the Classical theory, productivity is a theorem, representing the core of its explanatory power. This explanation stems from symbolic algorithms. The Classical theory of inference is notable for explaining how syntactic processes can preserve semantic truth. Inference has not been thoroughly explored in ICS, so this chapter does not address it in detail. The Classical theory can be summarized by the following principles:\\n\\n1. **Symbolic Inference Algorithms**: Inference is performed by serially applying the symbol manipulation operation of resolution.\\n\\n2. **Truth-Preserving Inference**: Inference maintains truth; if the semantic interpretations of given representations are true, the same holds for the products of inference.\\n\\nThe second principle follows from the first, a significant result of modern symbolic logic. The resolution rule of inference could be replaced by any set of sound inference rules, and the truth-preserving property would still hold.\\n\\nThe necessity of stipulating sound inference rules is at the level of specifying a set of rules that are sound. The Classical theory explains why inference is semantically truth-preserving by assuming that sound rules are applied during processing. However, it does not delve deeper to answer why those specific rules are chosen over unsound ones. To match the level of explanation provided by the symbolic theory, it suffices to stipulate a principle governing inference comparable to the symbolic inference algorithms.\\n\\nIn theory, ICS could accommodate this stipulation without issue. Since the ICS architecture realizes symbolic representations and functions, the resolution rule of inference could be implemented and used in various ways. One approach would be to apply the rule serially, aligning with the Classical theory. This would follow the implementationalist strategy, adopting the Classical explanation directly. While this would not introduce new insights at a higher level of analysis, it would not disadvantage ICS compared to the Classical theory in explaining inferential coherence. However, I believe that more effective ICS approaches are possible, so I prefer to explore those options. In summary, if one were content to match the Classical account of inference, it could be done immediately, but more promising ICS approaches are likely available, and I choose to wait for those.',\n"," '**4.2 ICS vs. Classical Theory on F&P Properties**\\n\\nIn this section, we compare the explanations of the F&P properties as provided by ICS (discussed in section 3.2) and the Classical theory (discussed in section 4.1):\\n\\n1. **Systematicity**: In ICS, systematicity emerges as a consequence of fundamental principles governing connectionist activation patterns. In contrast, the Classical theory achieves systematicity through stipulation, deliberately avoiding the introduction of lower-level principles from which systematicity could naturally arise.\\n\\n2. **Compositionality**: Both the Classical theory and ICS achieve compositionality through stipulation.\\n\\n3. **Productivity**: In both the Classical theory and ICS, productivity is derived from more fundamental principles. The Classical theory attributes it to the notion that cognitive processes are symbolic algorithms operating on constituents. In ICS, productivity arises from the assumption that cognitive processes are specific types of connectionist activation spreading algorithms, which cannot be reinterpreted at a higher level as symbolic algorithms.\\n\\n4. **Inferential Coherence**: In the Classical theory, truth preservation is a consequence of a fundamental algorithmic assumption. This issue is not currently addressed in ICS. However, the Classical assumption could be directly incorporated into ICS, providing the same explanation.\\n\\nIn summary, the level of explanation achieved in the Classical theory is not superior to that available in ICS. However, ICS offers a deeper explanation for both systematicity and productivity, with the latter being distinctly different from the Classical explanation.\\n\\nAmong the F&P properties, productivity is particularly significant in cognitive science, and this chapter has therefore focused on the ICS explanation of productivity. Nonetheless, ICS has several other objectives, which we will now explore.',\n"," \"### 4.3 Evaluation Relative to ICS Goals\\n\\nThe goals set for ICS (10-13) were outlined in Section 1.2. We will now evaluate them individually.\\n\\n#### 4.3.1 Preservation\\n\\nThe objective here (10) is to maintain the depth of explanation of higher cognition that symbolic theory has already achieved. In Section 4.2, we observed that ICS has met this goal concerning the F & P properties of higher cognition, and in some cases, it has even surpassed it.\\n\\nLooking more broadly across cognitive science, including AI, linguistics, and cognitive psychological modeling, it is evident that numerous challenges remain before this goal can be fully realized. A half-century of symbolic computation development has yielded a wealth of concepts and techniques. Considerable research is still needed to determine how this richness can be integrated into ICS. However, the ICS embedding of symbolic computation in PDP models, as outlined in this chapter, provides a solid foundation for such research.\\n\\n#### 4.3.2 Reduction\\n\\nThe goal here (11) is to explain how symbolic computation is built upon neural computation. As argued in Section 1.2.1, reducing symbolic computation to PDP connectionism is one of the few viable strategies, if not the only one, for pursuing this goal from our current standpoint. The success of ICS in achieving this reduction can be assessed by examining the principles of the ICS cognitive architecture (59-72). Principles marked with '∵' are consequences of other principles. Three principles of symbolic computation are targets for reduction: Rep_sym(HC) (62), Sem_sym(HC) (63), and Fun_sym(HC). Of these, two are flagged with '∵∵': Rep_sym(HC) and Fun_sym(HC) have been reduced to lower-level principles of PDP computation. The symbolic structure of representations and the recursive character of the functions computed over these representations have been reduced to tensor product structural properties of activation vectors (Section 2.2.1.2) and connection weight matrices (Section 2.2.2.3). Two open problems merit discussion: further reduction or explanation of the more fundamental PDP principles assumed here, and the lack of reduction of the compositionality of semantics: Sem_sym(HC).\\n\\nThe tensor product structure of activations and weights to which Rep_sym(HC) and Fun_sym(HC) have been reduced raises several open questions: Is there a deeper explanation for the tensor product structure? How is the special structure of the vectors and matrices 'enforced'? Is it correct to assume that this structuring is innate, or could it be learned? Is there an explanation from the connectionist level for why grammatical constraints often have the special strict domination property developed and exploited in Optimality Theory?\\n\\nThe fact that these questions arise and can be framed with precision is a hallmark of progress. The Classical theory, on the other hand, avoids such penetrating and difficult questions by invoking the Mystery Theory as its account of how human symbolic computation is realized.\\n\\nHowever, ICS offers no progress on the reduction or explanation of compositional semantics. Throughout this chapter, the need for a stronger semantic theory in ICS has been suggested in several places. It would be significant progress to reduce Sem_sym(HC) to more basic connectionist principles, as we have done for the other two symbolic principles of ICS, Rep_sym(HC) and Fun_sym(HC). This would likely involve a semantic theory that assigns interpretations to general activation vectors in the continuous vector space supporting PDP representations (20), not just the special discrete subset with tensor product form (see discussion in Section 2.2.1.2.2). The challenging task for such a theory is to enable the compositionality of semantic interpretation for those vectors with tensor product form to be derived as a theorem. Developing such a theory in a completely general context seems unrealistic at present. What seems needed is a cognitive domain where a continuous space of semantic interpretations is available rather than a space of discrete propositions. One possibility for such a domain, which might connect with existing linguistic theory within ICS, is linguistic semantics: the theory of meaning of natural language sentences. Recent work on 'cognitive semantics' suggests ways in which discrete, proposition-like semantic interpretations might be embedded within a larger continuous space of interpretations. Another possible domain for exploration is perceptual/motor skill, used by Haugeland (1991) to illustrate his persuasive argument that a truly connectionist semantics must involve a continuous space of semantic interpretations.\\n\\nAnother issue deserving attention in this future semantic theory is the choice of vectors to represent concepts or realize symbols. While atomic symbols form an unstructured set, the vectors realizing them do not: some sets of vectors are orthogonal to or independent of each other, while others are not; some pairs of vectors are more similar to each other than other pairs, and so forth. This structure is not exploited in ICS as presented here, but it seems possible that the mutual relations of different activity vectors realizing atomic symbols can be tied to the relations of their semantic interpretations. Clearly, enriching the semantic theory in ICS calls for a major research effort, and I will not attempt to predict the outcome of such an effort here.\\n\\n#### 4.3.3 Revision\\n\\nThis goal (12) is to use insights derived from the reduction of symbolic computation to lower-level principles to improve upon symbolic accounts of higher cognition. I argue that ICS achieves this in a core domain of higher cognition, grammatical theory (Section 3.3). Optimization principles from PDP computation are elevated to the higher level, where they take the form of Harmonic Grammars: systems of simultaneous soft constraints. The subsequent grammatical formalism, Optimality Theory, significantly enhances the explanatory power of generative grammar.\\n\\n#### 4.3.4 Integration\\n\\nThe final goal (13) is to understand how symbolic computational principles that explain core parts of higher cognition integrate with computational principles that explain other aspects of cognition. It is significant that the basic principles of ICS, assumed to hold in higher cognitive domains and which entail the symbolic principles, are specializations of general PDP principles with additional structure. Rep_ics(HC) arises by taking the general principle Rep_pdp that representations are vectors and adding tensor product structure. Alg_ics(HC, W) is derived from the general principle Alg_pdp(W) that core connectionist processing is matrix multiplication by adding recursive tensor product structure. (As discussed in the previous section, there is unfortunately not yet a more basic, general principle 'Sem_pdp' from which to derive Sem_sym(HC)—perhaps through 'Sem_ics(HC)', a more structured specialization of Sem_pdp.) Thus, ICS allows us to see precisely how the symbolic architecture of higher cognition is a consequence of specialized structure arising within the more general PDP cognitive architecture, which can naturally be applied to modeling a variety of lower-level cognitive phenomena that do not fall within the compass of the symbolic architecture. ICS also suggests ways that the symbolic character of 'core' higher cognition might interact with non-symbolic (perhaps continuous or ill-structured) aspects of 'non-core' higher cognition, for example, aspects of language not well captured in symbolic theory. The connectionist algorithmic substrate suggests processing models for higher cognitive domains (e.g., language) that employ the same processing mechanisms as PDP models of lower cognitive domains (e.g., perception).\\n\\nEven more speculatively, embedding a symbolic architecture within a PDP architecture raises the possibility of models of conceptual and grammatical development through PDP learning, and perhaps even exploration of the biological evolution of the symbolic architecture from less-structured PDP architectures in lower animals.\",\n"," '### 1. What the Folk Think\\n\\nIn Chapter 8, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon (hereafter referred to as RS&G) explore the common-sense understanding of belief, emphasizing a key concept they term \"propositional modularity.\" This thesis posits that propositional attitudes are \"functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes and ultimately in the production of behavior\" (Chapter 8, p. 315). These attitudes are considered functionally discrete because we often discuss agents acquiring or losing individual beliefs (Chapter 8, p. 316). They are semantically interpretable because folk psychology supports generalizations based on the semantic properties of beliefs. We categorize people as sharing a belief in a particular proposition and anticipate consistent behavioral patterns as a result. The predicate \"believes that P\" is intended to be projectable in the sense described by Goodman (1965). Finally, these functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states are said to influence behavior. An individual belief can be cited as the cause of a specific action. This last aspect is crucial for supporting the eliminativist argument. Therefore, it is beneficial to examine their examples in detail.\\n\\nThe first example involves Alice, who wants to send an email and believes she can do so from her office. She also wants to speak to her research assistant and believes she can do this at her office. The key point is that, according to folk psychological views on belief, she might go to the office due to just one of these belief/desire complexes, either of which would be sufficient to prompt the behavior (Chapter 8, p. 317).\\n\\nThe second example features Inspector Clouseau. Suppose Clouseau believes the butler claimed to have spent the evening at the village hotel and took the morning train home. Clouseau also believes (a) the hotel is closed and (b) the morning train is not running. Clouseau could infer, based on the butler\\'s statements, that the butler is lying. He could reach this conclusion by recognizing the inconsistency regarding the hotel, the train, or both. However, it is plausible, under the folk psychological framework, to imagine that he arrives at this conclusion by reflecting on just one piece of evidence. In essence, \"we see common-sense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert\" (Chapter 8, pp. 317-18).\\n\\nIn the following discussion, I will use a different example that I find clearer while preserving the essential structure of the authors\\' cases. Consider Lesley, who has the following two desires:\\n\\n- She desires a pint of Coopers.\\n- She desires to sit near an open fire.\\n\\nShe also holds these long-standing beliefs:\\n\\n- She believes the Dingo and Whistle serves draught Guinness.\\n- She believes the Dingo and Whistle has an open fire.\\n\\nOne night, while walking, she reads and understands the pub sign \"Dingo and Whistle\" and decides to enter. It is reasonable to assume she entered solely because of her desire for an open fire, even though her desire for Coopers alone would have been sufficient to cause her to enter.\\n\\nThe general claim is that someone might believe all of the following: \\\\(P\\\\), \\\\(P \\\\rightarrow Q\\\\), \\\\(Q \\\\rightarrow S\\\\), \\\\(P \\\\rightarrow R\\\\), \\\\(R \\\\rightarrow S\\\\), but on a given occasion, they might use only the \\\\(Q\\\\)-information to conclude \\\\(S\\\\).\\n\\nTraditional AI models, such as production systems and semantic networks, are, according to RS&G, visibly compatible with the thesis of propositional modularity. In a semantic network, for instance, distinct propositions are represented as distinct node-and-link patterns. This compatibility is even more evident when sentence-like symbol structures are stored. However, with highly distributed sub-symbolic connectionist models, RS&G argue that this compatibility vanishes.\\n\\nIt would be redundant to extensively describe this style of connectionist model here (as Smolensky does in Chapter 2; see also Clark, 1989). However, a few key points are helpful. First, these models represent data using densely connected networks of simple processing units linked in parallel by positively and negatively weighted connections. Second, the representation style involves distributed superpositional storage. \"Distributed\" means that what appears as a single piece of information in a public formalism (e.g., \"Fido is a dog\") is stored as a set of weights across many units, sensitive to semantic regularities finer-grained than public symbols. For example, \"dog\" might be a pattern across units representing color, eating habits, size, sound, etc. As representations become more distributed, the interpretability of individual units decreases until, at the limit, we cannot determine what feature they encode. Distributed representations facilitate superpositional storage, meaning one set of units and weights can be finely tuned to call up various activation patterns for different items, such as \"dog,\" \"cat,\" \"calf,\" and even unrelated patterns like \"bagel\" (see McClelland et al., 1986, ch. 17).\\n\\nConnectionist systems encode knowledge as complex patterns of positive and negative weights linking simple processing units. These units are often organized into three functional layers: an input layer, where the network receives a cue for recall or processing; a hidden unit layer, where the complex pattern of weights is further refined by units with activation thresholds that pass activation values to a final layer of output units, which express the system\\'s response to the input. The system thus expresses its knowledge as a pattern of activation resulting from a given input.\\n\\nSo, what is it that the folk are meant to find embarrassing?',\n"," '\\\\section*{2 Two Eliminativist Arguments}\\n\\nRS8G present two primary arguments aimed at demonstrating a supposed incompatibility between connectionist storage and representation and the assumptions of propositional modularity. These arguments are:\\n\\n1. An argument concerning superpositional storage and discrete causal efficacy.\\n2. An argument concerning natural kinds.\\n\\nLet\\'s examine each in turn.\\n\\n**Superpositional Storage**\\n\\nConsider a network, referred to as Network A, tasked with answering yes or no to 16 questions. The questions are presented by providing the network with a coded proposition as input (e.g., \"dogs have fur\") and interpreting the output from a single unit as \\'yes\\' if it activates, and \\'no\\' if it remains inactive. A standard connectionist learning algorithm can be employed to train the network to perform this task successfully. The trained network processes a vector of values across input units to encode the proposition and learns a set of weights connecting to and from hidden units, which mediate the desired input-output profile. For instance, suppose we have 16 input units, coding \\'dogs\\' as the pattern 11000011 across the first eight units and \\'have fur\\' as the pattern 00001111 across the last eight. The system learns to take input 1100001100001111 and produce output 1 (\\'yes\\') at the sole output unit. The learned weights connect the 16 input units to a layer of four hidden units and then to the output unit. The crucial point is that this single array of weights must be finely tuned (via an automatic learning algorithm) to function not just for one proposition but for all 16. The knowledge is thus stored superpositionally in a single, intricately orchestrated set of weights.\\n\\nAccording to RS&G, this approach already begins to conflict with folk psychology. Folk psychology would assert that it is the belief that dogs have fur that causes someone to say yes to the question, \"Do dogs have fur?\" However, if our memory were organized in the superpositional connectionist style, it seems unclear whether it makes sense to claim that a specific piece of stored information (rather than the rest) caused the output. As they state:\\n\\n\"The information encoded in Network A is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network. Whenever information is extracted, many connection strengths, biases, and hidden units play a role in the computation. Any particular weight, unit, or bias will help encode information about many different propositions. It simply makes no sense to ask whether or not the representation of a particular proposition plays a causal role in the network\\'s computation.\" (Chapter 8, pp. 326-7)\\n\\nIn other words, it is no more the case that the network\\'s knowledge that dogs have paws caused the \\'yes\\' output than it is the case that its knowledge that, say, cats have fur, caused it. All the information is stored in a single set of weights.\\n\\n**Natural Kinds**\\n\\nThe second argument from RS&G is what I call \\'the argument from natural kinds.\\' It proceeds as follows: Suppose you train a second network (B) on 17 propositions (the same 16 as Network A, plus an additional one). Network B will learn a set of weights that are globally different from those of Network A. This is because the use of superpositional storage means that the way you encode a proposition is crucially dependent on what other knowledge the network must store. Consequently, a 17-proposition network must store all 17 propositions in a manner subtly different from how the 16-proposition network stores its 16, even if the 16 are a subset of the 17. Contrast this with the more conventional procedure of adding a declarative representation (e.g., a sentence) to a list structure. The lists:\\n\\nList 1: dogs have fur, cats have fleas  \\nList 2: dogs have fur, cats have fleas, cats have fur  \\n\\nhave a common typographic subset. Such commonality can be preserved in traditional symbolic models, but it seems to vanish in superpositional connectionist storage.\\n\\nThe conclusion intended here is that where folk psychology identifies a natural psychological kind (all the believers that dogs have fur), connectionist psychology does not. The units-and-weights description of all the various networks that might encode such knowledge need not have any common sub-part. As RS&G put it:\\n\\n\"The moral here is that though there are indefinitely many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur just as well as Network A does, these networks have no projectible features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory. Thus, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind at all, but simply a chaotically disjunctive set.\" (Chapter 8, p. 329)\\n\\nFinally, the examples of Alice, Clouseau, and (in our case) Lesley are used to underscore the tension suggested in Argument 1 by emphasizing the folk\\'s apparent commitment to what I shall call the equipotency claim, namely:\\n\\n**Equipotency Claim:** An agent may have two long-standing beliefs that are both equipotent (both capable of causing the same behavior on a given occasion) AND YET the agent may, as a matter of fact, act based on only one of the two beliefs.\\n\\nThe concern is that, given the facts about superpositional storage outlined in Argument 1, it seems nonsensical to suppose that one of the beliefs, rather than the other, is active at a given moment.\\n\\nWe can capture the essence of the eliminativist arguments with a simple analogy. Imagine two ways of storing sentences. In the first method, you keep a discrete token of each sentence on a slip of paper in a drawer, making it easy to use the tokens one at a time. In the second method, you represent each sentence as a pot of colored ink. You then pour all the pots into a vat of water. It becomes challenging to use the colors separately, and the resultant overall color will vary depending on the global set of ink pots added. The commonality between various tokeners of the same sentence now seems lost. The question then is: how could a vat-and-inks (read \\'superpositional connectionist\\') style of storage be compatible with the assumption of propositional modularity?\\n\\nThere are three possible solutions. We might deny that folk psychology cares about propositional modularity, but I won\\'t pursue this. Alternatively, we could attempt to show that propositional modularity is secure regardless of what occurs in the mind. I don\\'t have a satisfactory method for doing this, though I discuss the matter briefly in section 5. Finally, we might argue that distributed, sub-symbolic, superpositional connectionist models are actually more structured than RS&G suggest, and thus visibly compatible with the requirements of propositional modularity. To this end, we might question the choice of a units-and-weights description as the sole description of a network for the purposes of scientific psychology. This seems like a promising approach, and I will explore it further in the next two sections.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{3 The Analysis of NETtalk}\\n\\nConsider NETtalk, a connectionist network designed for text-to-speech transformations. It processes a window of text, converting it letter by letter into phoneme codes, which are then used by a speech synthesizer to produce spoken sounds. The network is quite large, consisting of 309 units and 18,629 connections, including 80 hidden units and 55 output units corresponding to distinct phonemes (data from Arbib, 1989). In contrast, Network A in chapter 8 had only 21 units, with four hidden units and one output unit. This difference will become significant later.\\n\\nNETtalk successfully mastered its domain. However, this achievement holds limited value for cognitive psychology, as it merely demonstrates that training can induce competence—a fact already evident, as children learn this task regularly. In this sense, connectionist cognitive science is methodologically inverted compared to Classical AI. In Classical AI, one typically begins with a thorough task analysis and then constructs an algorithm. By the time the system is operational, its workings are usually understood. Connectionists, relying on training by examples, often have a functioning system without a clear understanding of its operation, prompting extensive post hoc analysis of their networks.\\n\\nSuch analysis can take various forms. It might involve recording and examining activation patterns for specific inputs, artificially lesioning networks to observe resulting disorder patterns, or conducting statistical analyses of network activity (Smolensky, 1990 provides a summary of available techniques). One such technique is cluster analysis. For NETtalk, this involves providing the network with various inputs, recording hidden unit activations and outputs, and grouping inputs that yield the same output phoneme. An average mediating hidden unit activation vector is calculated for each phoneme. Hierarchical clustering analysis is then used to pair the most similar vectors, averaging each pair and repeating the process to form a tree structure. This structure reveals how the network has organized the weight space to solve the problem, showing which inputs and groups of inputs are treated similarly. In NETtalk's case, the analysis is striking: at the bottom level, inputs like 'p' and 'b' are grouped together, while higher up, various soundings of 'o' are grouped. At the top, the system divides the space into two large sectors, one for vowels and the other for consonants.\\n\\nBefore returning to the arguments in RS&G, consider one more fact: NETtalk, like most such systems, begins training with a random pattern of weights, which are gradually adjusted by the learning algorithm. The authors of NETtalk (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1986) used the same training sequence on several networks with different random initial weights. These initial weights, akin to 'knowledge already stored' (though nonsensical for the new task), influenced how the networks stored learned material. This effect is similar to the discussion of Network A's and Network B's storage of a particular proposition. Despite different descriptions at the units-and-weights level, all versions of NETtalk produced similar clustering profiles when analyzed statistically. Thus, a scientifically respectable higher-level description was found, unifying what appeared to be a chaotic disjunction of networks at the units-and-weights level.\\n\\nThe takeaway is that higher-level descriptions can be scientifically grounded and capture commonalities between networks that are not visible at the units-and-weights level. It's important to note that the availability of a higher-level description does not imply that a network is merely implementing a classical symbolic system. Distributed, sub-symbolic encoding can still influence how a system retrieves data, generalizes, interpolates, and produces error patterns (e.g., cross-talk when sub-symbolic encodings are similar) in ways that are only explicable through its distinctively connectionist style of encoding and retrieval. In short, a network may have a cluster analysis that warrants symbolic labels without being a processor of symbols in the classical sense.\",\n"," '# Eliminativism Revisited\\n\\nRecall the argument concerning superpositional storage. The question was: how can it make sense to highlight a particular belief as causing an output when many weights are active in causing that output, and each weight participates in the storage of multiple data items?\\n\\nLet\\'s shift our focus from the active weights to what they are designed to do. They are intended to generate a pattern of hidden unit activity, which then causes the output.\\n\\nConsider the type of output we expect from a real-belief encoding system. Such a system must drive a complex and nuanced set of behaviors. It will resemble NETtalk (which has a large bank of output units) more than Networks A and B (which have only one unit with two degrees of freedom). Such a system is likely to undergo some form of post hoc analysis.\\n\\nSuppose it does. Let\\'s assume it undergoes a cluster analysis with labels involving semantic entities. In this case, we can untangle the superpositional storage by referring to higher-level descriptions of the hidden unit activation states. For instance, if the network, upon receiving a certain input, enters a hidden unit activation state that falls into a cluster labeled \\'dogs have fur,\\' we would be justified in saying it produced a certain output because it believed that dogs have fur at that moment.\\n\\nThese are significant assumptions: if the network succumbs to such an analysis and if it warrants labels like \\'dogs have fur.\\' However, the argument is dialectically sound. RS&G claim to argue directly from distributed, sub-symbolic storage and representation to eliminativism. The mere possibility of a cluster analysis as suggested shows that there is no direct inference of the kind claimed. If we can unpick the superpositional storage as suggested, then the arguments from natural kinds and equipotency are immediately undermined.\\n\\nConsider the argument from natural kinds again. The pivotal fact was the lack of any units-and-weights kind uniting nets A, B, and so on. But we can now see that RS&G are being unduly reductionist about well-motivated kinds. The fact that networks, which are quite varied at the units-and-connectivity level of description, are treated as instances of a psychological kind should not be surprising. This is similar to how an Amstrad and an Atari, when running the right software, can be treated as instances of a computational kind (e.g., as instantiations of a certain word-processing package). The variety-of-networks point only establishes that Connectionist psychology may need to use higher-level descriptions than units, connections, and weights. The example of cluster analysis shows that it is possible to reveal that a whole set of networks falls into an equivalence class defined by how their various weight assignments divide the spacing of possible input patterns into significant sub-spaces. Thus, it would be legitimate (given the common clustering profile) to assign all instances of NETtalk to a psychological kind, even though they look very different at the units-and-weights level. Such a grouping might help explain shared error patterns and the relative difficulty of processing various inputs. Of course, as Churchland (1989) points out, for some explanatory purposes (e.g., predicting how future learning will affect weight distributions), the differences will matter. My point is that there may be legitimate psychological-explanatory interests that call for the higher-level grouping provided by cluster analysis.\\n\\nThe basic philosophical point here is familiar. Good explanations may require grouping systems that, at a low enough level of physical description, form a \\'chaotically disjunctive set.\\' For example, economics may group an earth community and an antimatter-earth community together as instantiating Keynesian economic systems. We are probably all familiar with Putnam\\'s peg-and-hole example (see Putnam, 1981), where the explanation of variously constituted square pegs passing through square holes is given in terms of common higher-level properties like rigidity and solidity.\\n\\nFinally, consider the matter of equipotency. The concern was that it seemed nonsensical to suppose that an agent could have two beliefs, each capable of causing a given action, yet only one actually caused the action. Now consider Lesley\\'s two beliefs (one about Coopers, one about the open fire). It is straightforward to establish that the system must generally be capable of action appropriate to each belief individually (e.g., it must be capable of some range of actions that are beer-related and not fire-related). Otherwise, describing the network as knowing the two facts would be unwarranted. This requires that the system be capable of a set of hidden unit activation patterns associated with the beer-belief and a different (perhaps partially overlapping) set capable of powering different outputs, associated with the fire-belief. So we can say that one belief rather than the other was active if, for example, we found an instance of activation in the beer-cluster and not in the fire-cluster (this kind of response, in RS&G, is credited to Adrian Cussins and Gary Cottrell).\\n\\nRS&G respond by saying it is a mistake to identify the belief state with the transient activation state. They write:\\n\\n\"In common-sense psychology, beliefs and propositional memories are typically of substantial duration. An activation pattern, however, is not an enduring state of a network. For example, there is an enormous number of beliefs that you\\'ve had for years. But it makes no sense to suppose that a network could have many activation patterns continuously over a long period. At any given time, a network exhibits at most one pattern of activation.\" (Chapter 8, p. 331)\\n\\nSuppose we accept this. The next obvious move is to suggest that we might identify the belief not with the transient activation pattern but with the long-standing disposition to produce that activation pattern in a given circumstance. This move in the dialectic is credited to Ned Block and Frank Jackson. The trouble is that it is not obvious that the various dispositions said to correspond to various beliefs are sufficiently extricable from one another, as subvening states of the system, to count as the \\'discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires\\' (Chapter 8, p. 333).\\n\\nBut this muddies the waters unnecessarily. Beliefs need to be long-standing states, yes. And a belief-in-action needs to be capable of having a functionally discrete realization, yes. But the folk are not committed to the view that the belief-in-action and the long-standing stored state must be physically identical. The long-standing stored state may be the disposition, given inputs A-F, to propagate activation to yield a pattern of hidden unit activation P, which falls within a cluster appropriate to \\'believing that the pub has Coopers.\\' The discrete causal potency of that belief may be the power of that class of hidden unit activation states to cause a distinctive kind of output. So we have long-standing states and a degree of causal discretion. But what has causal discretion is not the long-standing state but the state of activation to which it gives rise.\\n\\nSomeone might worry that being in a certain cluster cannot, properly speaking, be a cause. They might insist that what actually does the causing must always be a particular hidden unit activation pattern and hence that, if we have to appeal to clusterings of such patterns to find analogues for semantic items, the semantic items cannot figure in the real causal story.\\n\\nBut this is a dangerous move. It places philosophical feet on a slippery slope to physics worship (and fundamental physics worship at that). This is radically revisionary. Chemistry, for example, is generally regarded as a respectable special science, yet it groups different physical structures as instances of chemical types and defines causal laws that apply to those types. Unless the skeptic is willing to give up the causal efficacy of chemical properties too, they would be unwise to object to the very idea of higher-level constructs figuring in genuine causal claims.\\n\\nIn general, then, it seems that invoking higher-level descriptions of hidden unit activity patterns may provide the kind of causal discretion RS&G require. However, there is a class of cases (invoked in a dialectic towards the end of Chapter 8) that may still seem problematic. These are cases (call them lemma-belief cases) where a particular belief is said to cause another belief, which in turn causes an action.\\n\\nThe trouble here is simple. Our account provides a single locus of discrete, causally-active belief states, namely, the locus consisting of a hidden unit activation pattern. But in some cases, we seem to want two (or more) such loci. Consider the case of Clouseau, who has the long-standing beliefs (dispositionally analyzed) \\\\(p \\\\rightarrow q, q \\\\rightarrow s, p \\\\rightarrow r, r \\\\rightarrow s\\\\) and learns that \\\\(p\\\\). Suppose we want to say of Clouseau that:\\n(a) he infers \\\\(s\\\\) using only the \\\\(q\\\\)-information; and\\n(b) his belief that \\\\(s\\\\) then causes him to perform an action \\\\(A\\\\).\\n\\nIt now looks as if the hidden unit states resulting from input \\\\(p\\\\) need to fall simultaneously into the \\\\(q\\\\)-cluster and the \\\\(s\\\\)-cluster variety. But the network cannot be in both states at once.\\n\\nThe answer here is to introduce a notion of recurrency. A recurrent network is one that can cycle an output state back as an input state and continue processing. Any good model of the belief system must allow that belief can play two roles. One is to mediate between perception and action. The other is to mediate between belief and belief. This means that the output states and input states must be capable of taking belief states as data too. In which case, the answer to the single locus worry is to invoke a single locus used twice in a serial process. Thus, in the Clouseau case, we would have input \\\\(p\\\\) yielding hidden unit activation falling into the \\\\(q\\\\)-cluster sector, which causes output meaning that \\\\(q\\\\). This is then cycled back as input, yielding activation falling into the \\\\(s\\\\)-sector and causing action \\\\(A\\\\).\\n\\nIn sum, it seems that, contrary to the eliminativists\\' conditional argument, distributed sub-symbolic models can allow for individual beliefs to be discretely active in causing behavior and other beliefs. They can do so if we adopt the following analysis:\\n1. Long-standing states of believing that \\\\(p\\\\) = the network\\'s disposition, given apt input, to produce hidden unit activation states falling into a cluster that warrants the label \\\\(p\\\\).\\n2. Active states of believing that \\\\(p\\\\) = patterns of hidden unit activation falling into the \\\\(p\\\\)-cluster.\\n3. Active lemma-belief states = as (2) but realized in a recurrent network.',\n"," '## 5 Semantic Facts, Consciousness, and Fodor\\'s Metaphysical Prejudice\\n\\nThis chapter primarily presents an empirical hypothesis: any system complex enough to qualify as a believer will exhibit semantically clustered patterns of activation upon analysis. Current models, such as NETtalk, support this hypothesis.\\n\\nBut what if this hypothesis proves incorrect? Suppose there is no well-founded non-semantic level of description for belief-encoding networks that aligns with the semantic categories identified by belief ascriptions. In that case, we face a dilemma with three potential resolutions: we could adopt eliminativism (denying the existence of beliefs and desires), embrace a modified eliminativism (acknowledging the practical value of the belief/desire framework in daily life while denying their causal efficacy), or pursue a radical defense where purely semantic facts are genuinely causal.\\n\\nFor a purely semantic fact (e.g., the fact that $F$ believes that $P$) to be genuinely causal, it must be possible to provide true causal explanations that reference the belief, even if there is no projectable non-semantic description of the system where an internal state is identified as the belief that $P$ with causal powers in the usual, non-semantic sense. \\n\\nConsiderations about the holism of belief and desire, while compelling, do not establish this radical possibility. We can accept that an internal state can be considered the belief that $P$ only in the context of other potential beliefs (and even world states) and still maintain that for a belief to have causal powers, it requires a causally active token identifiable as a token of some non-semantic kind.\\n\\nJerry Fodor is a philosopher who explicitly opposes the possibility of purely semantic facts. He states:\\n\\n\"I\\'d better \\'fess up to a metaphysical prejudice... I don\\'t believe that there are intentional mechanisms. That is, I don\\'t believe that contents per se determine causal roles. Consequently, it\\'s got to be possible to tell the whole story about mental causation (the whole story about the implementation of the generalizations that belief-desire psychologies articulate) without referring to the intentional properties of the mental states that such generalizations subsume.\" (Fodor, 1987, p. 139)\\n\\nThis opposition seems reasonable (a display of solid, materialist common sense) until we consider that the semantic (intentional) properties of some mental states appear to have causal powers by entering our conscious awareness. Often, I perform an action after rehearsing a reason \"in my head.\" The idea I wish to explore is that beings capable of consciously rehearsing reasons have a resource (i.e., conscious rehearsal) that allows for the discrete causal efficacy of beliefs, independent of the underlying mode of data storage and retrieval. Dualists, for example, could argue that spirit is undifferentiated and that individual consciously rehearsed beliefs are discrete causes of actions. In short, my belief that $P$ might cause action $A$ because my consciousness of $P$, however realized, led to my $A$-ing.\\n\\nRegarding psychological kinds, a proponent of consciousness might argue that the commonality among all believers of $P$, despite their varied constitutions, is that they all perceive the world as being $P$-ish.\\n\\nHowever, appealing to consciousness risks overvaluing our conscious claims about our reasons for acting. We do not want to assert that an alcoholic, who sincerely claims she entered the pub solely based on her belief about a fire, is necessarily correct. I am uncertain how to address cases of self-deception. Another reason to be dissatisfied with the appeal to consciousness is that it does not provide causal discretion for belief contents that are not consciously rehearsed.\\n\\nSurprisingly, a commitment to a materialistic worldview should not lead us to reject this account. We can acknowledge that conscious contents can offer a locus of causal discretion while still expecting a mature cognitive science to explain how conscious awareness of reasons is possible. The materialistic account of the causal discretion of reasons may thus rely on an explanatory detour, but this does not equate to abandoning materialism itself.\\n\\nThe appeal of invoking consciousness is that it immediately rules out eliminativism. However, the drawbacks are significant. It feels deeply unexplanatory, does not account for the causal discretion of non-conscious contentful states, and seems powerless against self-deception. The only other definitive way to rule out eliminativism, as Martin Davies (1991) reminds us, is to endorse some form of behaviorism, which often appears less appealing than the eliminativism it seeks to counter.',\n"," '**1.1 The False Presupposition**\\n\\nIn this section, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon (referred to as RS&G in Chapter 8) present a significant claim, attributing it to Jerry Fodor. Embedded within this claim is a false presupposition that is accepted by advocates of two opposing views on the relationship between Connectionist and Classical psychology: RS&G, who support eliminativism, and Fodor and Pylyshyn (F&P in Chapter 3), who support implementationalism. When this false presupposition is uncovered and examined within the context of RS&G\\'s argument, it reveals evidence not for either extreme view but for a more nuanced and intriguing position.\\n\\nThe erroneous presupposition in RS&G\\'s passage is evident in phrases like \"projectable features... describable in the language of Connectionist theory\" and \"not a genuine kind... but a chaotically disjunctive set,\" suggesting that these are not \"natural kinds\" in Connectionist psychology. For someone deeply involved in developing meaningful referents for \"Connectionist theory\" and \"Connectionist psychology,\" and in understanding the complex workings of connectionist networks to identify their \"projectable features,\" it is surprising to hear that such notions can be presupposed. The idea that one can simply display a connectionist network and immediately discern what Connectionist theory provides to Connectionist psychology is questionable. Even a cursory review of the connectionist literature should raise concerns about the dangers of such a presupposition. As RS&G themselves caution: \"it is early days yet\" (p. 312) for both the empirical discipline of Connectionist psychology and the formal theory of connectionist computation.\\n\\nRS&G themselves acknowledge my line of objection:\\n\\n**Objection (2):** Our models do not truly violate the principle of propositional modularity, as the propositions the system has learned are encoded in functionally discrete ways, though this may not be immediately apparent.\\n\\nThis objection has been elaborated in three distinct ways. The first, which we will call Objection (2a), notes that functionally discrete coding can be difficult to detect and is not always visible upon casual inspection.\\n\\n**Reply (2a):** This objection is challenging to address because the critic suggests that in models like ours, there might be a hidden functionally discrete system of propositional encoding yet to be discovered. We must concede that this is indeed possible. We have no argument that convincingly demonstrates the impossibility of discovering such a covert encoding. Moreover, if such a system were found, it would significantly undermine our argument (Chapter 8, p. 33).\\n\\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explicitly demonstrate that not only does such a \"covert\" system of encoding exist, but it is also essential for explaining the behavior of the networks RS&G consider. To uncover this covert system, we must apply the following central principle (Smolensky, 1986, and Chapter 2 of this volume), which will be frequently referenced in this paper:\\n\\n**Semantic Level Principle:** Semantically interpretable aspects of distributed connectionist models exist at the higher level defined by activation patterns or vectors and weight vectors, not at the lower level of individual units and connections. Semantic elements are non-local: individual semantic elements are defined over shared, spatially distributed regions of the network.\\n\\nIn this chapter, I will demonstrate how applying this principle to the network on which RS&G base their argument reveals a \"covert\" knowledge representation system. I will argue, in line with Objection (2), that while it is not immediately obvious from examining individual units and connections, analyzing these networks at the higher level of activation and weight vectors leads to a Connectionist version of the notion of belief. This notion shares some, but not all, of the critical properties of propositional modularity that RS&G argue make folk psychological beliefs targets for elimination by Connectionist psychology. This notion can be seen as a specific formalization of an idea articulated by RS&G as Objection (2c): Connectionist beliefs are dispositions to produce activation patterns.\\n\\nThe semantic level principle asserts that semantic notions in connectionist networks are abstract and must be formulated in terms of activation and weight vectors. The Connectionist notion of belief we will develop exemplifies this principle well. In its first formalization, C-belief, a Connectionist belief is specified by a region within the space of weight vectors: a network holds a C-belief if its weight vector lies in that region. Whether a network holds a particular C-belief generally depends on all the individual weights in the network: on the entire weight vector. Different C-beliefs reside in the same vector of weights. In the second formalization, L-belief, one particular weight vector in the region defining a C-belief is singled out; a network holding this L-belief has this particular vector as one of the components of that network\\'s weight vector. Both C-belief and L-belief possess one of RS&G\\'s crucial properties of propositional modularity: functional discreteness. Different C- or L-beliefs have discrete identities—not in the sense of being physically localized to different parts of the network, but in the sense of being discretely identifiable and combinable in the more abstract space of weight vectors where semantically interpretable elements must be sought, according to the semantic level principle. However, C- and L-beliefs do not individually play the same causal role as their Classical counterparts.\\n\\nThe pressure to develop Connectionist theoretical constructs to perform at least some of the functions of Classical beliefs also arises from another objection to RS&G\\'s argument, which they curiously do not address. RS&G claim that if a class of connectionist models is correct, they represent an ontologically radical theory shift in which folk psychological belief is eliminated. But eliminated in favor of what? The classic examples of eliminativism involve replacing a notion like caloric with a much richer and more formally elaborated set of concepts, such as those of the kinetic theory of heat. With such scientific progress as our guiding inspiration, we expect that the primitive notion of folk psychological belief will be replaced by a rich and formally elaborated set of concepts, providing a more adequate explanation of the same problems previously addressed by folk psychology. These new concepts define the \"projectable features of Connectionist theory\" and the \"natural kinds of Connectionist psychology.\" Where are they? They are not easily found in RS&G, and for good reason—such concepts are only now being developed. Presumably, to Fodor, \"Connectionist psychology\" is synonymous with \"Humean associationism,\" and the projectable features of Connectionist theory are those recognized by Hume. This is not the image of scientific progress evoked by the classic examples of eliminativism. So presumably RS&G envision other concepts embodied in connectionist psychology. RS&G do not specify what these concepts are, only what they are not: folk psychological beliefs, as characterized by the properties of propositional modularity.\\n\\nMy response begins not with the shared presupposition of RS&G and Fodor—that we know what the projectable predicates of Connectionist theory are—but with its negation. I ask not what Connectionist theory can do for (or to) belief, but what belief can do for Connectionist theory. At least in the class of networks RS&G consider, I show that Connectionist theory requires a concept like belief, and that such a concept can indeed be constructed using existing theory.\\n\\nThe crux of this argument is the nature of the relationship between connectionist and classical cognitive architectures. If RS&G\\'s argument were correct, the results, as they point out (p. 312), would be (a) that proponents of the cognitive architecture represented by the connectionist models RS&G consider should accept the eliminativist conclusion, at least regarding Classical belief, and (b) that those who find such an eliminativist conclusion untenable should reject this connectionist cognitive architecture and instead accept, for example, the implementationalist conclusion that the only viable connectionist architecture is one that implements the classical architecture.\\n\\nHowever, the specific way RS&G\\'s argument will be shown to fail will lead to a different conclusion. Both the eliminativist and implementationalist conclusions will be found unwarranted. Contrary to RS&G-style eliminativism, the concept of Connectionist belief we will construct will share several important properties of propositional modularity with its folk psychological counterpart, and the theory shift is therefore not ontologically radical in the sense claimed by RS&G. Contrary to implementationalism, the Connectionist notion of belief will differ in important ways from its Classical relative. Contrary to both eliminativism and implementationalism, the result will be that, by taking a Classical notion seriously, we actually advance connectionist theory—and at the same time, connectionist theory substantially revises that Classical notion. When the relationship between the connectionist and Classical notion of belief is examined in more detail, the relationship between the connectionist and classical cognitive architecture exemplified will turn out to be the intermediate position between eliminativism and implementationalism proposed as \"The Proper Treatment of Connectionism\" in Chapter 2, adding new support for recent developments in that theoretical framework.\\n\\nRS&G\\'s argument resides in the philosophy of (cognitive) science; it purports to analyze the nature of a shift from folk psychological to Connectionist theory. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the central concern in this chapter is with the actual content of Connectionist theory. The overarching fact is that developing a satisfactory theory of connectionist computation is extremely difficult, and while some progress has been made, such a theory still seems far off. Thus, for most kinds of connectionist networks, it is impossible to determine how Connectionist theory relates to Classical theory, simply because the theory of that kind of network is so weak. So it becomes critical what kind of connectionist model we choose to base our assessment of RS&G on. If we choose state-of-the-art connectionist cognitive models, the theory is so underdeveloped that no conclusions are possible. In order to have anything interesting to say, we must turn to simpler models where there is at least some existing theory. This would appear to be the spirit in which RS&G chose their model, although their argument is in fact oblivious to what Connectionist theory actually has to say concerning their model. As we will see, their model falls on the current frontier of network theory, and to the extent that the theory exists, it would seem to argue the incorrectness of RS&G\\'s conclusions.\\n\\nFor a more definitive result, I prefer to focus on a model slightly simpler than RS&G\\'s, a kind of network for which the theory is now quite complete. There, where we actually have a Connectionist theory on which to test RS&G\\'s analysis, we can clearly identify its failures. Whether the conclusions based on Connectionist theory that actually exists are likely to survive in the face of future developments in Connectionist theory is a subject of speculation taken up in the conclusion (Section 5).',\n"," \"### 1.2 Chapter Overview\\n\\nThe argument presented by RS&G is based on a connectionist model, which I will refer to as RSGnet. In my response, I will examine a simplified version of RSGnet, termed \\\\( RSGnet_0 \\\\), as defined in Section 3. My analysis relies heavily on elucidating the behavior of networks similar to RSGnet. The development of the necessary explanatory concepts of \\\\( C \\\\)-belief and \\\\( L \\\\)-belief is more straightforward with the simplified network \\\\( RSGnet_0 \\\\). The Appendix provides an explicit analysis of the original RSGnet, demonstrating how to apply the concepts of \\\\( C \\\\)-belief and \\\\( L \\\\)-belief to explain the more complex network. A complete explanation is not yet feasible and likely requires further advancements in connectionist theory.\\n\\nThe progression of my argument is as follows, with each claim identified by the section number in which it is discussed:\\n\\n1. **Section 2**: Connectionist explanation necessitates a technical notion to fulfill the role of belief. Two strategies exist for deriving such a notion: weight analysis and learning analysis.\\n   \\n2. **Section 3**: By pursuing these two strategies within connectionist theory, through the analysis of the simplified network \\\\( RSGnet_0 \\\\), we derive two connectionist formalizations of the notion of belief: \\\\( C \\\\)-belief and \\\\( L \\\\)-belief.\\n\\n3. **Section 4**: \\\\( C \\\\)- and \\\\( L \\\\)-beliefs exhibit some, but not all, of RS&G's properties of propositional modularity.\\n\\n4. **Section 5**: Conclusion: \\\\( C \\\\)- and \\\\( L \\\\)-beliefs demonstrate that RS&G have actually constructed an argument supporting the 'proper treatment of connectionism,' rather than eliminativism or implementationalism.\\n\\n5. **Section 6**: Postscript 1, addressing a concern: It is legitimate to replace RSGnet with \\\\( RSGnet_0 \\\\); \\\\( RSGnet_0 \\\\) is equally valid as RSGnet in illustrating RS&G's class of connectionist models.\\n\\n6. **Section 7**: Postscript 2, Appendix: \\\\( C \\\\)- and \\\\( L \\\\)-beliefs also play significant roles in explaining RSGnet, although current theory may not yet be sufficient to fully explain RSGnet.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{2 The Need for Connectionist Belief}\\n\\nRSGnet effectively evaluates the truth values of a set of encoded propositions. But to what extent does this serve as an explanation of cognitive capacity? At first glance, it seems we have merely replaced one black box—the human reasoner we aim to understand—with another, RSGnet. Progress is made to the extent that we can better inspect and comprehend RSGnet, which we designed, compared to the original human subject. As McCloskey (1992) suggests, in this crucial aspect, connectionist models are akin to animal models in biology. However, the model becomes an object of analysis rather than an analysis itself; the network serves as the explanandum, not the explanans—albeit a much simpler one than the original human case. The question then arises: how can we explain RSGnet's ability to accurately judge the truth values of propositions?\\n\\nThe initial instinct is to examine the weights in RSGnet for an explanation, as these weights encode the network's knowledge. RS&G encourage this instinct with illustrations like their figures 8.4-8.8, which provide numerous weights for contemplation. However, such an atheoretical approach predictably results in mystery and wonder at the network's correct behavior, without yielding any real insight.\\n\\nLet's approach this seriously. There's no need for pretheoretical confusion, given that the theory of computation in such networks has been developing for decades. Without this foundation, the technical means to create RSGnet wouldn't exist. Section 3 will employ straightforward mathematical analysis of the weights in networks like RSGnet to provide the desired explanation. This explanatory strategy will be termed weight analysis. But first, we must consider an appealing alternative strategy.\\n\\nInstead of focusing on the weights themselves, we might examine the learning process that produced them. This learning analysis would explain RSGnet's behavior as follows: RSGnet was trained by presenting a set of propositions as input, each with its correct truth value. The back-propagation learning algorithm gradually adjusted the initial weights to a final set of values that correctly associate the output with each training input. This explains the network's ultimate performance.\\n\\nThere are two shortcomings to this proposed explanation via learning analysis. First, it merely shifts the burden of explanation from RSGnet's weights to the general learning algorithm, back-propagation, which produced them. We now need to explain why back-propagation generally produces weights that correctly associate outputs with inputs. Unfortunately, no such explanation exists, despite back-propagation's remarkable success, which has earned it a revolutionary status in connectionist theory (Chauvin and Rumelhart, forthcoming). It is theoretically impossible for a learning algorithm to train any network to correctly associate any set of inputs and outputs. For any given network architecture, there are always input/output pairs that cannot be correctly computed by that network; no learning procedure can generate a correct set of weights if none exist. Thus, no sound explanation of RSGnet can rely solely on its training properties. At the very least, it must be shown that the training patterns and network architecture are compatible, meaning there is a correct set of weights for back-propagation to produce. This requires weight analysis. Even demonstrating compatibility is not sufficient, as back-propagation is not guaranteed to find a correct set of weights in networks with hidden units, even when such weights exist. This is true for every algorithm for training networks with hidden units, as far as I know. Therefore, learning analysis is doubly challenging. First, weight analysis is needed to demonstrate compatibility; then, it must be shown that the network/training pattern combination allows back-propagation to succeed in constructing a correct set of weights. I am unaware of any means to accomplish the second step; if possible, it is surely extremely difficult.\\n\\nAdditionally, learning analysis has another deficiency: even if successful, it would only explain why the network performs correctly on its training set. Generally, we also need to explain the network's performance on inputs it wasn't trained on—its generalization capacity. RS&G note, for example, that RSGnet correctly generalizes to two propositions it wasn't trained on (chapter 8, p. 330), suggesting some capacity for inference rather than mere memorization. Explaining generalization capacity through the learning strategy is even more challenging than explaining correct behavior on the training set. While powerful methods exist for estimating the probability of correct generalization, these techniques cannot explain specific patterns or instances of correct or incorrect generalization, such as why RSGnet correctly generalizes in the case of the two propositions RS&G cite. Such explanation seems crucial for claims about the knowledge present in RSGnet. As we will see, weight analysis provides means for studying generalization.\\n\\nThe strategy of weight analysis offers considerable explanatory power, but like learning analysis, it is challenging to execute. The preceding remarks aim to dispel any hopes that learning analysis can bypass these difficulties with a simple application of back-propagation. Weight analysis is challenging enough; learning analysis is even more so.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{3.1 Weight Analysis and C-Beliefs}\\n\\nWe begin this analysis by simplifying RSGnet in three ways, resulting in a network we will refer to as $RSGnet_{0}$. In the original RSGnet, propositions are deemed true or false if the output is sufficiently close to 1 or 0, respectively. Our first modification is to interpret a proposition as true if the output of $RSGnet_{0}$ is positive, and false if it is negative. This adjustment facilitates the transition back to the original RSGnet. The second simplification involves removing the hidden units and directly connecting each input unit to the output unit. The final simplification replaces RSGnet's nonlinear output unit with a simpler, linear unit that computes its activation value by summing the product of each input unit's activation and the weight of its connection to the output unit. The resulting network is illustrated in Figure 10.1.\\n\\nThe output of $RSGnet_{0}$ can be easily expressed as a function of its input. Let $n$ represent the number of input units, with their activities denoted as $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n}$. Each input unit is connected to the output unit, and the weights of these connections are denoted by $w_{1}, w_{2}, \\\\ldots, w_{n}$. The output unit's value, $o$, is given by the following equation:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\no = w_{1}a_{1} + w_{2}a_{2} + \\\\ldots + w_{n}a_{n} \\\\tag{1}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nEquation (1) can be further simplified by grouping all the weights into a weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w} = (w_{1}, w_{2}, \\\\ldots, w_{n})$ and all the activities into an activity vector $\\\\mathbf{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n})$. Thus, equation (1) can be rewritten as:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\no = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\tag{2}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThe right-hand side of equation (2) is simply an abbreviation of equation (1). However, equation (2) is crucial because it is conceptually and technically essential to analyze connectionist networks at the level of vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\\\mathbf{a}$, rather than individual connections $w_{i}$ and activations $a_{i}$. According to the semantic level principle, the semantically relevant properties of connectionist networks lie at this higher level of aggregation. Henceforth, all analysis will focus on the vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\\\mathbf{a}$, without considering their individual elements $w_{i}$ and $a_{i}$.\\n\\nFigure 10.2 illustrates the state space of $RSGnet_{0}$ in the two-dimensional case of two input units $(n=2)$. (a) The weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ divides the space into two half-spaces, $\\\\mathbf{w}^{+}$ and $\\\\mathbf{w}^{-}$. (b) The network with weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ produces a positive output for input $\\\\mathbf{a}$ since $\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{w}^{+}$; negative for $\\\\mathbf{a}'$; and zero for $\\\\mathbf{a}''$. (c) The same results as in (b), but with the roles of $\\\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\\\mathbf{a}$ reversed: the output for $\\\\mathbf{a}$ is positive since $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{a}^{+}$, etc.\\n\\nBoth vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\\\mathbf{a}$ can be viewed as points in an $n$-dimensional state space; $\\\\mathbf{w}$, for instance, is the point with coordinates $(w_{1}, w_{2}, \\\\ldots, w_{n})$. Alternatively, $\\\\mathbf{w}$ can be seen as an arrow leading to the point $(w_{1}, w_{2}, \\\\ldots, w_{n})$ from the origin $(0,0, \\\\ldots, 0)$. This arrow divides the entire state space into two half-spaces. There is a plane through the origin perpendicular to $\\\\mathbf{w}$. The arrow $\\\\mathbf{w}$ lies on one side of this plane; the half-space on the same side is called the positive half-space determined by $\\\\mathbf{w}$, denoted $\\\\mathbf{w}^{+}$. The opposite side is the negative half-space $\\\\mathbf{w}^{-}$ (see Figure 10.2a).\\n\\nWith these higher-level concepts, we can give the expression $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}$ in equation (2) a geometrical interpretation. It turns out that $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}$ (and hence $o$) is positive if $\\\\mathbf{a}$ lies in the positive half-space determined by $\\\\mathbf{w}$, $\\\\mathbf{w}^{+}$; negative if $\\\\mathbf{a}$ lies in the negative half-space $\\\\mathbf{w}^{-}$; and zero if $\\\\mathbf{a}$ lies on the plane separating these two half-spaces, the plane through the origin perpendicular to $\\\\mathbf{w}$ (see Figure 10.2b). This understanding is useful for determining how a network with a given weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ responds to different input activity vectors $\\\\mathbf{a}$.\\n\\nAn alternative perspective is useful for analyzing learning, where $\\\\mathbf{w}$ is unknown while the training activity patterns $\\\\mathbf{a}$ are given. The operation $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}$ is symmetric in the two vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\\\mathbf{a}$ ($\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a} = \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{w}$), as is evident from its definition in equation (1). Thus, by reversing the roles of $\\\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\\\mathbf{a}$, we can alternatively characterize the output $o = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}$ as positive or negative depending on whether $\\\\mathbf{w}$ lies in the positive or negative half-space $\\\\mathbf{a}^{+}$ or $\\\\mathbf{a}^{-}$ determined by $\\\\mathbf{a}$ (see Figure 10.2c).\\n\\nNow, we can consider $RSGnet_{0}$ as an evaluator of propositions. Let a proposition $p$ be encoded as an input activation vector $\\\\mathbf{p}$. Then, according to equation (2), $RSGnet_{0}$'s output is $o = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}$. If $o$ is positive, $p$ is judged true; if $o$ is negative, false; if $o$ is zero, then $RSGnet_{0}$ refuses to decide. Given the geometric interpretations of the previous paragraphs, we have:\\n\\n(3) The proposition $p$ is judged true if its encoding $\\\\mathbf{p}$ lies in $\\\\mathbf{w}^{+}$, or equivalently, if $\\\\mathbf{w}$ lies in $\\\\mathbf{p}^{+}$; $p$ is judged false if $\\\\mathbf{p}$ lies in $\\\\mathbf{w}^{-}$, or equivalently, if $\\\\mathbf{w}$ lies in $\\\\mathbf{p}^{-}$.\\n\\nGiven a set of training propositions $P = \\\\{p, q, r, \\\\ldots\\\\}$, and a corresponding set of truth values $\\\\{\\\\operatorname{tr}(p), \\\\operatorname{tr}(q), \\\\operatorname{tr}(r), \\\\ldots\\\\}$, equation (3) clearly indicates what is required for $RSGnet_{0}$ to correctly judge each proposition $\\\\pi$ in $P$ as having the truth value $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi)$: the weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ encoding the network's knowledge must simultaneously satisfy all the following conditions:\\n\\n(4) $\\\\mathbf{w}$ must lie in the positive half-space $\\\\pi^{+}$ if $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi) = \\\\text{TRUE}$, and in the negative half-space $\\\\pi^{-}$ if $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi) = \\\\text{FALSE}$. (There is one such requirement for each proposition $\\\\pi = p, q, r, \\\\ldots$ in the training set $P$.)\\n\\nLet's call the intersection of all the half-spaces referred to in equation (4) the solution space. If the solution space is non-empty—if all the half-spaces $\\\\pi^{\\\\pm}$ in equation (4) have a proper intersection—then the set of training propositions $P$ with their corresponding truth values are compatible with $RSGnet_{0}$'s architecture, as defined in section 1 above: there exists a set of weights $\\\\mathbf{w}$ that correctly judges the truth of all the training propositions. Otherwise, no such set of weights exists (see Figure 10.3).\\n\\nIf the solution space is non-empty and more than one-dimensional, there will be many inequivalent sets of weights that all correctly judge the training propositions but differ in their judgments on other propositions—that is, they generalize differently. The alternative patterns of generalization can be mapped out by studying the solution space, using equation (3) as follows. Let $x$ be a proposition not in the training set, and consider the two half-spaces $\\\\mathbf{x}^{+}$ and $\\\\mathbf{x}^{-}$. Every weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ in the solution space that falls in $\\\\mathbf{x}^{+}$ is one that generalizes or 'infers' that $x$ is true; those with $\\\\mathbf{w}$ falling in $\\\\mathbf{x}^{-}$ 'infer' that $x$ is false. Those with $\\\\mathbf{w}$ falling in the plane separating $\\\\mathbf{x}^{+}$ from $\\\\mathbf{x}^{-}$ simply refuse to judge $x$.\\n\\nWith this analysis in hand, we adopt the following definition:\\n\\n(5) $RSGnet_{0}$ has the $C$-belief that $\\\\pi$ is true (or false) if $\\\\mathbf{w}$ lies in $\\\\pi^{+}$ (or $\\\\pi^{-}$).\\n\\nThat is, a C-belief is specified by a region of state space (a half-space, $\\\\pi^{+}$ or $\\\\pi^{-}$, in fact), and to say that a network holds a C-belief is to say that the weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ that encodes its knowledge lies in that region. Successful training of a network on a set of propositions is achieved when the weights have been adjusted so that the network holds all the training C-beliefs. When a network holds a C-belief about a proposition not in the training set, it can be said to 'infer' that C-belief. Depending on the network and the training set, it may or may not be possible to simultaneously hold all the training C-beliefs. When it is possible, there may be many alternative networks that hold the training C-beliefs, and these alternative networks may make different inferences about propositions outside the training set.\\n\\nSuppose now that in RS&G's argument, we replace RSGnet with $RSGnet_{0}$, providing it with a weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ that enables it to correctly judge the propositions in some training set and to draw some reasonable inferences. We can now formulate the following explanation of why $RSGnet_{0}$ behaves as it does: by examining $\\\\mathbf{w}$, we see that the network holds all the correct C-beliefs. That is, one by one, we can mathematically verify equation (5): for each proposition $\\\\pi$, $\\\\mathbf{w}$ is in the correct half-space $\\\\pi^{+}$ or $\\\\pi^{-}$.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{3.2 Learning Analysis and L-Beliefs}\\n\\nFor RSGnet$_{0}$, conducting a learning analysis, though requiring careful consideration, is both feasible and rewarding. Under certain conditions, which will be discussed shortly, the training of $\\\\mathrm{RSGnet}_{0}$ results in a weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ that can be expressed as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\mathbf{q}^{*} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\mathbf{r}^{*} + \\\\ldots \\\\tag{6}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIn this equation, $\\\\mathbf{p}$ represents the activity vector encoding the proposition $p$, and similarly for other training propositions encoded as vectors $\\\\mathbf{q}, \\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\ldots$. The truth value of $p$ is encoded as $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) = +1$ if $p$ is true, and $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) = -1$ if $p$ is false. The vector operation ${ }^{*}$ will be explained below.\\n\\nThe conditions under which equation (6) holds are as follows:\\n\\n(7) (a) All weights are zero at the start of training.  \\n(b) The learning algorithm used is the Delta Rule, with the target output for input $\\\\pi$ being $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi)$, and a sufficiently small learning rate to ensure convergence.\\n\\nThe Delta Rule is a simplified version of back-propagation (originally called the Generalized Delta Rule by Rumelhart et al., 1986b). It is suitable for networks without hidden units (for further discussion and references, see Rumelhart et al., 1986a). It will converge to a correct set of weights when such weights exist. These weights always exist when the training patterns $\\\\mathbf{p}, \\\\mathbf{q}, \\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\ldots$ are linearly independent, meaning none can be expressed as a weighted sum of the others. In this case, the * operation is defined as follows: the vector $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ is perpendicular to all other training patterns $\\\\mathbf{q}, \\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\ldots$ and satisfies $\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}^{*} = +1$. This vector lies in the positive half-space $\\\\mathrm{p}^{+}$ and in the plane separating the positive and negative half-spaces of all other propositions $\\\\pi = q, r, \\\\ldots: \\\\pi \\\\cdot p^{*} = 0$. The existence of such a vector $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ is guaranteed by the assumed linear independence of all propositions.\\n\\nIt is crucial to remember that the * operation is defined in terms of the entire training set. Repeated presentation of this entire set during network training is necessary for the learning algorithm to gradually evolve what amounts to the ${ }^{*}$ operation, by incrementally considering the similarity of the patterns in the training set. The simple formula (6) describing the result of this process conceals the considerable computational complexity of deriving all the vectors $\\\\pi^{*}$ from the training set.\\n\\nGiven the weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ from equation (6), it is straightforward to verify that for the input $\\\\mathbf{p}$, and similarly for any other input training proposition, RSGnet$_{0}$ correctly produces the output value $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p)$:\\n\\n\\\\[\\no = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\mathbf{q}^{*} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\mathbf{r}^{*} + \\\\ldots\\\\right] \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\mathbf{q}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\mathbf{r}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} + \\\\ldots = \\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\tag{8}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis is because, by the definition of the * operation, $\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}^{*} = +1$ and $\\\\pi^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p} = 0$ for $\\\\pi = \\\\mathbf{q}, \\\\mathrm{r}, \\\\ldots$.\\n\\nAn informal version of this argument is as follows: for each proposition $p$, there is a weight vector $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ that is a 'pure' encoding of the belief that $p$ is true. When the weights are set to $\\\\mathrm{p}^{*}$, the network outputs TRUE $(o = +1)$ for input $\\\\mathbf{p}$ but refuses to judge all other propositions $\\\\mathbf{q}, \\\\mathrm{r}, \\\\ldots$ in the training set (it outputs $o = 0$). The weight vector $-\\\\mathrm{p}^{*}$ is a corresponding pure encoding of the belief that $p$ is false $(o = -1)$. Thus, $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathrm{p}^{*}$ is a pure encoding of the correct belief about $p$; let's name it as follows:\\n\\n(9) Given a proposition $p$ in a training set, call the weight vector $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ the $L$-belief that $p$ has truth value $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p)$ (NB: $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ is defined relative to the training set).\\n\\nTo handle multiple beliefs in the training set, we can simply add, or superimpose, all these L-beliefs, resulting in the total weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ of equation (6). This vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ has one component $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi) \\\\pi^{*}$—an L-belief—for each training proposition $\\\\pi$. This weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ correctly judges all the training propositions because when the proposition $\\\\mathbf{p}$ is presented as input, one component of $\\\\mathbf{w}$, the L-belief for $p$, $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$, yields the correct judgment $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p)$, while the remaining components $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi) \\\\pi^{*}$ all refuse to pass judgment. Thus, superimposing or adding together all the judgments gives the correct truth value.\\n\\nThe relationship between the C-beliefs arising from weight analysis and the L-beliefs arising from learning analysis is as follows: the C-belief that $p$ is false is a large region of weight space $\\\\mathbf{p}^{-}$ in which $\\\\mathbf{w}$ must lie for the net to judge $p$ false. The L-belief that $p$ is false is one particular vector $-\\\\mathrm{p}^{*}$ in this large region, a vector singled out only when the rest of the training set is specified (for only then can we define $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ as the vector perpendicular to all other training propositions). To correctly encode all beliefs in a training set, $\\\\mathbf{w}$ must lie in the intersection of all the training C-beliefs: the solution space. In the general case where the solution space is non-empty—where the training proposition vectors are linearly independent—and the net is trained in accordance with (7), we can say that the particular vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ resulting from training is that vector (6) which is a sum of component vectors, one per training proposition: each such component is the corresponding L-belief. This vector lies in the solution space, as verified in (8).\\n\\nSuppose we have a set of linearly independent training propositions on which RSGnet$_{0}$ has been trained according to (7). The explanation of why RSGnet$_{0}$ behaves correctly, derived from our learning analysis, is as follows: the weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ encoding the net's knowledge can be decomposed into a superposition of components, each of which is an L-belief in one of the training propositions. The network's correct performance on the training set is a direct consequence of this structure in $\\\\mathbf{w}$, as explained formally in (8) and informally in the subsequent paragraph. The L-beliefs are constituents of the network's knowledge, in a sense discussed below in section 5.\\n\\nEquation (6) allows us to determine how the network judges a proposition $x$ not in the training set, in terms of the 'similarity' of the novel proposition to the training ones. By equations (2) and (6), the output produced when $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is input is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\no = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\mathbf{q}^{*} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\mathbf{r}^{*} + \\\\ldots\\\\right] \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\mathbf{q}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\mathbf{r}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\ldots = \\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\operatorname{sim}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}, \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) + \\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\operatorname{sim}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q}^{*}, \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) + \\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\operatorname{sim}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}^{*}, \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) + \\\\ldots \\\\tag{10}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe 'similarity' function $\\\\operatorname{sim}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}, \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right)$ is simply defined by $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}$. It is a common practice in connectionist models to interpret $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}$ as the similarity between the patterns $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ and $\\\\mathbf{x}$ because it represents a correlation between the elements of the two patterns. For example, if the elements of the patterns $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ and $\\\\mathbf{x}$ are all 1s and 0s (as in the input patterns to RSGnet), then $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}$ is simply the number of positions where both vectors have a 1. If '1' is interpreted as the presence of some feature or property, as is common in connectionist representations, then $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}$ is the number of properties present in both $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ and $\\\\mathbf{x}$—a measure of their similarity.\\n\\nEquation (10) indicates that the response of the net to a novel input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is a weighted sum or superposition of its responses to all its training propositions $\\\\pi$, with each response weighted by the similarity of the novel input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ to the training example $\\\\pi^{*}$.\",\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{3.3 Summary: $C$- and L-beliefs in RSGnet ${ }_{0}$}\\n\\nThe strategies of weight analysis (section 3.1) and learning analysis (section 3.2) have each identified crucial projectable predicates: C-beliefs and L-beliefs, respectively. These predicates are central to the Connectionist theory, which outlines the conditions under which a network accurately evaluates a proposition and the outcomes of learning. C- and L-beliefs are not immediately apparent upon casual examination of the network; they are defined at the level of activation and weight vectors. Attempting to discern semantically meaningful predicates by examining individual activities and weights is as futile as inspecting individual bits in a digital computer's memory.\\n\\nWe have derived C- and L-beliefs from the analysis of RSGnet $_{0}$, a simplified version of the original RSGnet. Some may question the validity of focusing on RSGnet $_{0}$ instead of the original RSGnet. However, RS\\\\&G's claim pertains to the implications of an entire class of connectionist networks, of which RSGnet is merely one example. It is evident that RSGnet $_{0}$ is also a valid representative of this class, which I will refer to as PTC models—those that embody the 'proper treatment of connectionism'. The justification for using RSGnet $_{0}$ in response to RS\\\\&G will be addressed in section 6 to avoid diverting attention from the primary argument.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{4 C-beliefs and Propositional Modularity}\\n\\nWe now address a critical question: do the concepts of C-beliefs and L-beliefs exhibit any of the three properties of propositional modularity that RS&G argue make Classical belief a candidate for elimination by the PTC form of connectionism? Let's examine these three properties individually.\\n\\n**Semantic Interpretability**\\n\\nBoth C-beliefs and L-beliefs clearly involve semantic interpretation. The core principle of our analysis is the semantic level principle, which posits that semantically interpretable aspects of connectionist networks exist at the higher level of activation and weight vectors, rather than at the lower level of individual units and connections. Making claims about the semantic properties of connectionist networks by examining individual units and connections constitutes a fundamental category error. Without weight and learning analysis conducted at the vector level, no valid claims about semantic properties can be made. However, concepts such as C-beliefs and L-beliefs, which exist at this higher level, enable us to explain the behaviors of connectionist networks in semantically interpretable terms.\\n\\n**Functional Discreteness**\\n\\nRS&G's discussion of functional discreteness focuses on the relationship between Network A, which is successfully trained on a set of 16 propositions, and Network B, which is trained on the same set with an additional 17th proposition. We can apply the concepts of C-beliefs and L-beliefs to understand the relationship between Net A and Net B, which are analogous to RS&G's networks but use the architecture of RSGnet$_{0}$ instead of RSGnet. The C-beliefs of Net B include the 17 propositions it was trained on, 16 of which are also held by Net A. This implies that the weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}_{B}$ of Net B must reside in a solution space $S_{B}$ that is smaller than the solution space $S_{A}$ containing $\\\\mathbf{w}_{A}$. $S_{A}$ is defined as the intersection of 16 half-spaces, while $S_{B}$ is the intersection of these 16 with an additional 17th half-space. Although the C-beliefs are not physically localizable to different spatial sub-regions of the networks, there is a more abstract but well-defined sense in which the 17 beliefs are functionally discrete: the projectable predicates used to describe the knowledge-encoding vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}_{A} / \\\\mathbf{w}_{B}$ are precisely the 16/17 C-beliefs. In terms of actual Connectionist theory, it is accurate to state that there is an additional C-belief in the second network compared to the first. Furthermore, if a process were to disturb the weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}_{B}$, causing it to move out of the solution space $S_{B}$ while remaining within the larger solution space $S_{A}$, it would be reasonable to say that the second network had 'lost' or 'forgotten' the 17th belief while retaining the other 16. The ability to discuss one belief coming or going independently of others is central to RS&G's characterization of functional discreteness (chapter 8, p. 316).\\n\\nFunctional discreteness can also be observed through L-beliefs, although greater caution is required. Assuming Nets A and B have been trained according to (7), their weight vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}_{A}$ and $\\\\mathbf{w}_{B}$ are given by (6) as:\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n& \\\\mathrm{A} \\\\mathbf{w}_{A}=\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*}+\\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\mathbf{q}^{*}+\\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\mathbf{r}^{*}+\\\\ldots  \\\\tag{11} & \\\\mathrm{B} \\\\mathbf{w}_{B}=\\\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\\\mathbf{p}^{*}+\\\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\\\mathbf{q}^{*}+\\\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\\\mathbf{r}^{*}+\\\\ldots+\\\\operatorname{tr}(z) \\\\mathbf{z}^{*}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nwhere $z$ is the extra (17th) proposition on which Net B is trained. It is important to note that the * operation depends on the training set, so the vector denoted $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ in (11A) and that denoted $\\\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ in (11B) are generally different vectors. Thus, we can analyze $\\\\mathbf{w}_{A}$ and $\\\\mathbf{w}_{B}$ as containing 16 and 17 L-beliefs, respectively. In this case, the L-belief that $p$ has the truth value $\\\\operatorname{tr}(p)$ is generally somewhat different in the two networks.\\n\\nOur exploration of basic Connectionist theory reveals the inaccuracy of RS&G's crucial claim, part of which was cited in section 1 as the primary impetus behind this response:\\n\\nThe contrast between Network A and Network B allows us to illustrate the incompatibility between common-sense psychology and these types of connectionist models in a different way. We noted in section 3 that common-sense psychology treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of propositional attitudes as projectable. Thus, 'believes that dogs have fur' or 'remembers that dogs have fur' are projectable predicates in common-sense psychology. Both Network A and Network B could serve as models for a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur; both networks store or represent the information that dogs have fur. These are not the only two possibilities. If we were to train a network on the 17 propositions in table 8.1 plus a few (or minus a few), we would obtain yet another system as different from Networks A and B as these two are from each other. The moral here is that although there are indefinitely many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur as well as Network A does, these networks lack projectable features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory. From the perspective of the connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind but rather a chaotically disjunctive set. Common-sense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a psychologically natural kind; Connectionist psychology does not (chapter 8, pp. 328-9).\\n\\n**Causal Role**\\n\\nWhile C-beliefs and L-beliefs possess the first two properties of propositional modularity, they do not exhibit the final property. RS&G illustrate the modular causal roles of the beliefs of folk psychology as follows: it makes sense to say (a) that a particular instance of an action taken by an agent was caused by a specific belief/desire pair and not another, even though both pairs are held by the agent and both pairs rationally entail taking the given action; (b) that a particular instance in which an agent infers a conclusion was caused by one set of beliefs and not another, even though both sets are held by the agent and both sets logically entail the given conclusion (pp. 317-18). Focusing on the most relevant case (b), we must conclude that there is no corresponding sense for $\\\\mathrm{RSGnet}_{0}$ that some set of relevant C-beliefs are causally implicated in an inference on a particular occasion, while another set of relevant C-beliefs are not causally implicated on that occasion but might be on another.\\n\\nThe failure of this property for RSGnet$_{0}$ is most evident from learning analysis. As explained in (10) above, when a proposition $x$ is presented for judgment, the net computes its judgment by superimposing its response to all the training patterns $\\\\pi$, each response weighted by the similarity of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\\\pi^{*}$. When this similarity is 0—when $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\pi^{*}=0$, i.e., when the L-belief $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi) \\\\pi^{*}$ concerning $\\\\pi$ produces no judgment of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ as true or false—the effect of the training pattern $\\\\pi$ on the judgment of $x$ is nil. (Thus, for example, if the truth value of $\\\\pi$, $\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi)$, were reversed prior to training the net, this would have no effect on the judgment of $x$.) In such a case, it could be reasonably said that this L-belief is not relevant to $x$ and has no 'causal role' in the judgment of $x$. On the other hand, if the similarity of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\\\pi^{*}$ is non-zero, then the L-belief about the truth value of $\\\\pi$ is relevant, and it plays a causal role in the net's judgment of $x$. There is no meaningful sense in which a relevant belief might play a causal role in judging $x$ on one occasion but not another; all relevant beliefs always have the same causal role.\",\n"," '\\\\section*{6 A Worry: Adequacy of RSGnet $_{0}$ as an Illustrative Example}\\n\\nIn this section, I argue that it is valid to substitute RSGnet with RSGnet $_{0}$ in responding to RS\\\\&G. As demonstrated in the Appendix (section 7), the specific method RS\\\\&G use to encode propositions into activation vectors, along with the particular set of propositions and truth values in their training set, are incompatible with the simple architecture of RSGnet $_{0}$. For these input patterns, the solution space is empty: there is no weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w}$ that allows RSGnet $_{0}$ to accurately evaluate RS\\\\&G\\'s encoded training propositions; it cannot simultaneously hold all those training C-beliefs. However, the analysis in section 7 will also explain why this incompatibility exists, showing that nothing relevant to RS\\\\&G\\'s argument is involved. If a different encoding of the same training propositions had been chosen (or a different set of propositions), there is no reason why RSGnet $_{0}$ could not serve as effectively as the original RSGnet as an illustrative model. Therefore, in adopting RSGnet $_{0}$ as our example, we must assume that the encoded beliefs arbitrarily chosen by RS\\\\&G have been replaced by a set compatible with the architecture of RSGnet $_{0}$. When we refer to RSGnet $_{0}$, we assume it has been successfully trained on such an appropriate set of encoded beliefs.\\n\\nIt is true that networks like RSGnet $_{0}$, which lack hidden units, are less computationally powerful than those like RSGnet, which have hidden units. Thus, we expect realistic cognitive models to include hidden units. However, RSGnet is not intended as a realistic cognitive model; it is deliberately simplified to serve as an instructive example. The additional simplicity of RSGnet $_{0}$ enhances its instructiveness for our purposes. RS\\\\&G claim that it is the general properties of connectionist models, which RSGnet illustrates, that lead to an eliminativist conclusion, rather than RSGnet itself. Therefore, the crucial question is whether RSGnet $_{0}$ possesses these general properties.\\n\\nIn their section 4, RS\\\\&G characterize the class of connectionist models relevant to their argument by three general properties. Starting with the last one, RS\\\\&G describe their third characteristic as follows:\\n\\n\"Because of their obvious, though in many ways very partial, similarity to real neural architectures, it is tempting to view connectionist models as models of the implementation of psychological processes... A very different view that connectionist model builders can and often do take is that their models are at the psychological level, not at the level of implementation.\" (Chapter 8, p. 323)\\n\\nOur interpretive position regarding RSGnet $_{0}$ aligns with RS\\\\&G\\'s regarding RSGnet, so there is no concern about their third characteristic.\\n\\nThe first two general properties identified by RS\\\\&G are of greater concern: the widely distributed (1) and sub-symbolic (2) nature of the representations. Regarding (1), they state:\\n\\n\"It is connectionist networks of this sort, in which it is not possible to isolate the representation of particular propositions or states of affairs within the nodes, connection strengths, and biases, that we have in mind when we talk about the encoding of information in the biases, weights, and hidden nodes being widely distributed rather than localist.\" (p. 322)\\n\\nRegarding (2):\\n\\n\"It is often plausible to view such networks as collectively or holistically encoding a set of propositions, although none of the hidden units, weights, or biases is comfortably viewed as a symbol. When this is the case, we will call the strategy of representation invoked in the model sub-symbolic.\" (p. 322)\\n\\nWhen the input patterns constitute a widely distributed encoding of propositions, RSGnet $_{0}$ illustrates the sub-symbolic strategy. In section 7, we will see that RS\\\\&G\\'s representation of propositions is fairly weakly distributed. Since we assume an alternative encoding of their training propositions for RSGnet $_{0}$ (one compatible with its architecture), we should consider a fully distributed input representation, making RSGnet $_{0}$ a better illustration of (1) and (2) than the original RSGnet. A fully distributed representation involves all connectionist units participating directly in representing all the constituents of the proposition. A systematic study of such representations and their formal relation to less distributed forms of connectionist representation (such as the \\'semi-local\\' input representation of RSGnet) was presented in Smolensky (1987, 1990a). The connectionist representational framework introduced there, tensor product representations, is sufficiently mathematically analyzable to formally characterize conditions in which such representations (e.g., fully distributed ones) are compatible with the architecture of RSGnet $_{0}$. The theory is in place for systematically constructing an entire family of fully distributed encodings of RS\\\\&G\\'s propositions, allowing RSGnet $_{0}$ to learn all the training beliefs.\\n\\nThe most important point is that unless the input representation is \\'hyper-local\\', where each input proposition is represented by its own dedicated unit, the notions of C- and L-beliefs we have developed are non-local: a single connection is involved in multiple C- and L-beliefs concerning different propositions. With fully distributed input representations, every connection is part of the C- or L-belief for every proposition. With a less distributed representation, such as that used by RS\\\\&G, most connections are involved in several (but not all) beliefs. In this crucial respect, there is no difference between RSGnet $_{0}$ and RSGnet.\\n\\nThe salient difference between RSGnet and RSGnet $_{0}$ is that the former has four hidden units, while the latter has none. This does not affect whether the representation is widely distributed (1) or sub-symbolic (2). RS\\\\&G\\'s initial statement of (2) — \"individual hidden units in the network have no comfortable symbolic interpretation; they are subsymbolic\" (p. 320) — refers to hidden units, but the concept of sub-symbolic representation does not depend on the existence of hidden units. Given that the input representation of RSGnet is not very widely distributed (as seen in section 7), adding four hidden units to RSGnet makes its total representation more distributed than if the representation were carried entirely by the input units. However, adopting a fully distributed input representation for RSGnet $_{0}$ is at least as effective in illustrating sub-symbolic representation as adding a few hidden units to a weakly distributed input representation in RSGnet. One reason the former strategy is more satisfactory is that in some studies (e.g., Sanger, 1989, 1990), hidden representations trained by back-propagation, when examined in mathematical detail, have proved to be much less distributed than commonly assumed a priori. The exact case in RSGnet is unclear without analysis by techniques such as Sanger\\'s contribution analysis, which is quite complex.\\n\\nThus, there is no reason to prefer RSGnet over RSGnet $_{0}$ as an illustration for RS\\\\&G\\'s argument. However, it is worth further exploring the notions of connectionist belief developed here, making contact with the original illustration, RSGnet. This is done in the following Appendix, which concludes that the presence of hidden units in RSGnet doesn\\'t eliminate the C- and L-beliefs derived from its simpler cousin RSGnet $_{0}$; the hidden units merely obscure and complicate the C- and L-beliefs. This conclusion is worth further analysis because it is of interest to know whether concepts such as C- and L-beliefs apply to more complex networks than RSGnet $_{0}$, and for this purpose, RSGnet serves as a useful example. At the same time, the analysis in the Appendix should dispel any lingering doubts about whether some trick has been played by studying RSGnet $_{0}$ rather than RSGnet. The question of whether notions such as C- and L-beliefs apply to \\'realistic\\' connectionist cognitive models, which are considerably more complex than RSGnet, was already addressed in section 5.',\n"," '### 2.1 Natural Kinds and \\'Higher Levels of Description\\'\\n\\nIn RS&G, two networks, Network A and Network B, are described as both responding affirmatively to an input sequence that encodes the proposition that dogs have fur. It is suggested that these networks could serve as models, albeit \"tiny toy\" models, for a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur. Both networks are said to store or represent this information (Chapter 8, p. 329). However, upon examining the weights and biases of these networks, they appear to have little in common. Furthermore, it is evident that many other networks could store the same information, differing as much from Networks A and B as these two differ from each other. The implication is that, although numerous connectionist networks can represent the information that dogs have fur as effectively as Network A, they lack any projectable features in common that can be described using the language of Connectionist theory. From the perspective of a connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind but rather a chaotically disjunctive set. While commonsense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a natural kind, Connectionist psychology does not (Chapter 8, p. 329).\\n\\nClark disagrees, arguing that RS&G are being \\'unduly reductionist\\' (p. 000) in their characterization of connectionist kinds. He suggests there is a \\'higher level of description\\' (p. 347) that can unify what appears to be a chaotic disjunction of networks at the units-and-weights level (p. 347). To illustrate this, Clark refers to the \\'post hoc\\' cluster analysis conducted by Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1986) on NETtalk. The key finding was that, despite different training runs leading to versions of NETtalk with very different descriptions at the units-and-weights level, all versions yielded similar clustering profiles when subjected to post hoc statistical analysis (p. 347). Clark concludes that there may be higher-level descriptions that are scientifically well-grounded and capture commonalities between networks that are invisible at the units-and-weights level (p. 347).\\n\\nHowever, how does this relate to RS&G\\'s natural kind argument? Clark seems to believe that just as various versions of NETtalk yield similar clustering profiles, so too will various networks modeling cognitive agents with a given belief manifest higher-level commonalities invisible at the units-and-weights level. Clark\\'s chapter essentially bets that any system complex enough to be considered a believer will reveal semantically clustered patterns of activation under some post hoc analysis. Models like NETtalk support this contention (Chapter 9, p. 352).\\n\\nWe find this argument puzzling and are unsure of its meaning. On the most charitable interpretation, Clark\\'s \\'unabashed empirical bet\\' seems destined to fail. We contend that the higher-level commonalities Clark\\'s argument requires are not present, even in systems like NETtalk. To understand this, we must clarify which systems are alleged to have these \\'higher-level\\' common properties.\\n\\nOne way to characterize the relevant class of systems is behaviorally or functionally. NETtalk is a connectionist network trained for text-to-speech transformations, taking a window of text and converting it letter by letter into phoneme codes fed into a speech synthesizer (pp. 345-6). We use the term NETtalker for any system capable of performing these transformations with impressive accuracy. Another way to characterize these systems is by their architecture. The NETtalk network comprises 309 units and 18,629 connectors, including 80 hidden units and 55 output units corresponding to distinct phonemes (p. 346). We use the term NETtalk-structure for systems fitting this description and similar to the network described by Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1986).\\n\\nSejnowski and Rosenberg showed that several different NETtalkers with NETtalk-structure yielded similar clustering profiles when subjected to post hoc statistical analysis (p. 347). It might be plausible to conjecture that all NETtalkers with a NETtalk-structure will yield similar clustering profiles. However, it is likely possible to build NETtalkers without a NETtalk-structure. One could build NETtalkers with 800 or 8,000 hidden units. As Clark notes (note 4), when trained using back-propagation, systems with more hidden units tend to find different strategies than those with fewer hidden units. The Sejnowski and Rosenberg cluster analysis was limited to systems with a NETtalk-structure, providing no reason to suppose that all NETtalkers, regardless of structure, will exhibit similar clustering profiles. It is unclear if comparing the clustering profiles of two NETtalkers with radically different structures even makes sense.\\n\\nTo understand the relevance to RS&G\\'s natural kind argument, we return to Clark\\'s \\'unabashed empirical bet.\\' Clark bets that \\'any system complex enough to count as a believer\\' will manifest higher-level commonalities with all other such systems. But how does Clark propose to characterize the systems to which the bet applies? He doesn\\'t want to restrict his claim to systems with structures like Network A and Network B or any other specific architectural features. Instead, the systems are characterized behaviorally or functionally, similar to how NETtalkers were characterized earlier. However, as we have seen, there is no plausibility to the suggestion that all NETtalkers exhibit similar or identical cluster profiles. Since Clark\\'s \\'bet\\' was based on the analogy with NETtalk, it seems clear that the smart money will bet against him.\\n\\nBefore leaving the natural kind argument, let\\'s briefly consider how our discussion might apply to Smolensky\\'s view. On a natural reading, Smolensky\\'s reply to RS&G\\'s natural kind argument is similar to Clark\\'s. Smolensky also suggests that certain connectionist networks share non-obvious \\'higher-level\\' features, even if they appear to have little in common upon casual inspection. The difference is that Smolensky does not rely on analogies; he explains in detail how the shared features (C-belief and L-belief) are defined.\\n\\nOur issue with Smolensky\\'s argument is uncertainty about which systems he believes will manifest the common features he characterizes. To understand this, we return to Clark\\'s \\'unabashed empirical bet.\\' Clark bets that \\'any system complex enough to count as a believer\\' that $p$ will manifest appropriate higher-level commonalities with any other system complex enough to count as a believer that $p$. This is needed to rebut RS&G\\'s natural kind argument. RS&G claim that \\'the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes [that $p$] is not a genuine natural kind but a chaotically disjunctive set\\' (Chapter 8, p. 329). If Smolensky is offering a serious rebuttal, he must claim that any connectionist network modeling a cognitive agent who believes that $p$ would manifest the C-belief or L-belief that $p$. However, if this is Smolensky\\'s claim, his argument does not establish his conclusion. Most networks we consider as models of a cognitive agent who believes that $p$ are likely more complex than either RSGnet or Smolensky\\'s RSGnet ${ }_{0}$. Smolensky concedes he does not know how to define C- and L-belief for these more complex systems. It may be unfair to attribute to Smolensky the claim that all networks modeling a believer that $p$ will manifest the C- or L-belief that $p$. He never explicitly makes such a claim. However, if he doesn\\'t accept this claim, it is hard to see how his construction of C- and L-belief is relevant to RS&G\\'s natural kind argument. RS&G claim that networks modeling agents who believe that $p$ \\'have no projectable features in common describable in the language of Connectionist theory\\' (Chapter 8, p. 329). If we read Smolensky as claiming only that some networks modeling agents who believe that $p$ have the C- or L-belief that $p$, he has not responded to RS&G\\'s challenge.\\n\\nIn Chapter 10, Smolensky claims it is \\'likely\\' that \\'explanatory notions richer, more powerful, and more cognitively relevant than C- and L-beliefs will emerge\\' from Connectionist theory. He notes that \\'[w]hether the new notions will support the conclusions drawn here from C- and L-beliefs is impossible to know in advance\\' (Chapter 10, p. 380). RS&G concede in their Reply (2a) that they have no argument proving it is impossible to discover the \\'covert functionally discrete encoding\\' that folk psychology seems to require, and that \\'if such a covert system were discovered, then [their] argument would be seriously undermined\\' (Chapter 8, p. 331). Though Smolensky\\'s tone is more optimistic than RS&G\\'s, the difference between their positions is nearly indiscernible.',\n"," '**2.2 Superpositional Storage and Discrete Causal Efficacy**\\n\\nIn the second argument presented by RS&G, which Clark examines, he refers to it as the argument from \"superpositional storage.\" The core assertion of this argument is that in networks like A and B, where information is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network, it becomes nonsensical to question whether the representation of a specific proposition plays a causal role in the network\\'s computation (Chapter 8, p. 327). In contrast, common-sense psychology typically assumes it is meaningful to ask whether a particular belief influenced a cognitive episode or if it was causally inactive. Furthermore, common sense acknowledges that in some instances, an agent may hold two long-standing beliefs that are equally capable of causing the same behavior, yet the agent may act based on only one of these beliefs (Clark, Chapter 9, p. 345). Clark refers to this as the \"Equipotency claim.\"\\n\\nIn response to RS&G\\'s argument, Clark initially suggests identifying a belief with a specific pattern of hidden unit activation. By doing so, it becomes straightforward to determine whether a belief plays a causal role in a network\\'s computation. However, as Clark notes, RS&G anticipated this proposal and criticized it, arguing that having a belief is typically a long-standing feature of a system, whereas being in a particular activation state is not a persistent state of the network.\\n\\nClark continues, \"Suppose we accept this. The next logical step is to suggest that we might identify the belief not with the transient activation pattern but with the long-standing disposition to produce that activation pattern in a given circumstance\" (p. 350). Yet, as Clark reports, RS&G also anticipated and criticized this move.\\n\\nThe issue is that it is not clear whether the various dispositions corresponding to different beliefs can be sufficiently separated from one another, as subvening states of the system, to qualify as the \"discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires\" (p. 350). Clark argues that this complicates matters unnecessarily. Beliefs need to be long-standing states, and a belief-in-action must be capable of having a functionally discrete realization. However, folk psychology does not require the belief-in-action and the long-standing belief to be physically identical. The long-standing stored state may be the disposition to produce an appropriate pattern of hidden unit activation, and the discrete causal potency of that belief may be the power of that class of hidden unit activation states to cause a distinctive kind of output (p. 350).\\n\\nWe identify two distinct problems with this response. First, the interpretation of the propositional modularity assumption implicit in the reply is too weak, rendering the assumption trivial. According to Clark\\'s argument, no deterministic system storing propositional information could fail to satisfy propositional modularity. If this is correct, there is nothing we could learn about such a system\\'s workings that would show it violates propositional modularity. Secondly, as Clark concedes, his suggestion does not address the equipotency problem unless supplemented with an assumption about recurrency. However, this assumption leads to models of cognitive activity that are both bizarre and unworkable. We will elaborate on each of these issues in turn.\\n\\nImagine being given a black box that behaves like RS&G\\'s Network A. Given any of the 16 coded sentences in Table 8-1 of RS&G, it answers yes or no, with the same responses as Network A. Suppose further that we know the black box is a deterministic device, responding consistently to a particular input type. Beyond this, we know nothing about how the device operates.\\n\\nLet\\'s ask whether the device respects the principle of propositional modularity. According to Clark\\'s interpretation, the answer must be yes. Every time the black box receives a particular input, it produces the same output. There must be some pattern of internal states—simple or complex—that the system goes through to get from input to output. Following Clark, we can identify the \"belief-in-action\" with this pattern of internal states, whatever it may be. Of course, this pattern is a transient state, not an enduring state of the system. So if we seek long-standing beliefs, it is not a suitable candidate. But this needn\\'t concern us. The system must have a long-standing disposition to produce the \"belief-in-action\" pattern, and we can identify that disposition with the long-standing belief. The \"belief-in-action\" is a very different state from the long-standing belief, but according to Clark, that\\'s acceptable. There is no need for the two to be identical. Thus, our black box appears to satisfy propositional modularity, as Clark interprets it. Since we know nothing about the box except that it is a deterministic device that responds appropriately, it seems any deterministic device that can respond appropriately to various coded sentences must represent them in a propositionally modular fashion. On Clark\\'s reading of propositional modularity, anything that behaves like a believer truly is one.\\n\\nWe can imagine an opponent content with this result. This opponent argues that common-sense psychology makes no substantive claims about the mechanisms underlying behavior. Passages in Dennett\\'s work appear to endorse such a view (see, for example, Dennett, 1987), and Jackson and Pettit (1990) also seem to flirt with this neobehaviorist account of belief. However, this would be an odd position for Clark to endorse. A central theme in Clark\\'s work is that if the scientific account of the mechanisms underlying behavior conflicts with the common-sense account, \"then we\\'ve got trouble\" (p. 352) since the eliminativist will have prevailed. Since Clark takes this eliminativist threat seriously, he cannot adopt the toothless interpretation of propositional modularity that his reply to RS&G requires. On that interpretation, any deterministic system that behaves like a believer automatically satisfies propositional modularity, and there is no possibility that a scientific account of the mechanisms underlying that behavior will conflict with propositional modularity.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s turn to Clark\\'s discussion of the equipotency problem. In the scenario outlined by RS&G, Clouseau has two long-standing beliefs, each of which might contribute to his inference that the butler is lying. On Clark\\'s proposal, both of these long-standing beliefs are dispositions of the belief-storage system. So how do we determine which contributed to the inference? Clark\\'s answer involves the notion of recurrence. To play a role in an inference, the dispositional state must first produce a hidden activation pattern, which causes an output; that output is then \"cycled back as input\" to the storage system, yielding the conclusion about the butler as a second output.\\n\\nThe first observation about this proposal is that it seems contrary to the spirit of connectionism, as it overlooks what ardent connectionists see as one of their models\\' most important virtues: the ability to simultaneously utilize a large number of facts or constraints. In contrast, Clark\\'s account of inference requires each intermediate step to be individually activated and then cycled back as a premise in a new computational cycle.\\n\\nHowever, this is the least of the problems with Clark\\'s proposal. A more serious issue is that the idea won\\'t work when the logical forms of the conditionals involved in the inference are more complex. Suppose, for example, that Clouseau has long-standing beliefs of the form:\\n\\n- If \\\\( p^* \\\\) then \\\\( p \\\\)\\n- If \\\\( q^* \\\\) then \\\\( q \\\\)\\n- If \\\\( p \\\\& q \\\\) then \\\\( s \\\\)\\n\\nNow suppose he is informed that \\\\( p^* \\\\). After a brief delay during which he may think about other matters, he is informed that \\\\( q^* \\\\). How is he supposed to arrive at \\\\( s \\\\)? According to Clark\\'s story, when he learns that \\\\( p^* \\\\), he outputs \\\\( p \\\\). At this point, he might recycle \\\\( p \\\\) into the system, but it wouldn\\'t produce \\\\( s \\\\). Now \\\\( q^* \\\\) comes along. The system outputs \\\\( q \\\\). Feeding this back as input won\\'t yield \\\\( s \\\\) either. As far as we can see, there is no way for the system Clark sketches to get from \\\\( p^* \\\\) and \\\\( q^* \\\\) to \\\\( s \\\\). Thus, far from having the resources to handle cases of equipotency, the system Clark proposes lacks the capacity to handle even simple inferences.',\n"," \"\\\\subsection*{3.1 Eliminativism and the Description Theory of Reference}\\n\\nAs Lycan (1988, p. 4) has aptly observed, many eliminativists, as well as their opponents, often write as if they accept some version of the description theory of reference for the theoretical terms used in both common-sense and scientific theories. Broadly speaking, this theory suggests that a term within a theory refers to those entities in the world that satisfy all (or most) of a specific set of 'descriptions' (or open sentences) that the theory implies about these entities. A particularly clear and influential account of this idea was proposed by David Lewis (1970, 1972). According to Lewis (1972, p. 209), a theory typically provides an 'implicit functional definition' of the terms it introduces. Theoretical terms are defined as the entities that occupy the causal roles specified by the theory, meaning they are the entities, whatever they may be, that have certain causal relationships with one another and with the referents of the observational terms (Lewis, 1972, p. 211). But what if the theory is proven false, and the pattern of causal relations it specifies does not actually exist? In such a case, according to Lewis, the theoretical terms would refer to nothing. For instance, since the causal relations specified by phlogiston theory do not exist, the term 'phlogiston' refers to nothing. Phlogiston does not exist. Similarly, if the names of mental states are like theoretical terms, they name nothing unless the theory is more or less true (Lewis, 1972, p. 213).\\n\\nIf Lewis's account of the reference of theoretical terms is correct, it would provide eliminativists with the means to bridge the logical gap noted earlier. If Lewis is correct, and if folk psychology is indeed a fundamentally flawed theory, then it would follow that beliefs and desires do not exist. Terms like 'belief' and 'desire,' along with other theoretical terms of folk psychology, would refer to nothing.\\n\\nHowever, this poses a challenge for eliminativists, as it is not clear that Lewis is correct, or that any version of the description theory accurately accounts for the reference of theoretical terms. Since the publication of Lewis's papers, philosophical opinion on these matters has shifted significantly. In response to arguments and examples from Putnam, Kripke, and others, most philosophers in this field have concluded that description theories, like the one proposed by Lewis, do not provide the correct account of the reference of terms used in a theory. The prevailing contemporary view is that some version of the causal/historical account of reference—similar to the accounts outlined by Putnam (1975), Kripke (1972), and Devitt (see Devitt, 1981; Devitt and Sterelney, 1987)—is the correct account for most theoretical terms. According to these causal/historical accounts, the reference of a term is determined by a causal chain linking users of the term with previous users from whom they acquired it, ultimately tracing back to an event or series of events where the term was introduced to refer to a specific object or kind.\\n\\nOne advantage of causal/historical theories is their ability to address what Devitt and Sterelney (1987) call 'the problems of ignorance and error.' These theories readily explain how a person can refer to an object or kind despite having significantly mistaken beliefs about it. Thus, under the causal/historical theory, it is entirely plausible that ancient stargazers and modern astronomers are referring to the same celestial bodies, even though the ancients believed stars were holes in the celestial dome through which light from the heavenly region beyond could pass. In contrast, description theories struggle to explain how the ancients could refer to anything at all.\\n\\nThis presents a challenge for eliminativists. If their strategy for bridging the logical gap between the premise that common-sense psychology is fundamentally flawed and the conclusion that its terms do not refer to anything relies on the description theory of reference, they must defend this theory and demonstrate that the competing causal/historical account is incorrect. We are skeptical that this can be achieved. Indeed, one of us has argued elsewhere that there may be no correct theory of reference for terms embedded in a fundamentally false theory (see Stich, 1991, and forthcoming). However, this chapter does not hinge on that radical view. Our point here is simply that the strategy for bridging the gap we have been considering is highly problematic. It will require substantial argumentation to make the description theory appear plausible.\",\n"," \"**3.2 Eliminativism and 'Constitutive' Properties**\\n\\nIn some discussions within this field, there are suggestions of an alternative approach to bridging the gap in the eliminativist argument. Instead of depending on the description theory of reference, this approach utilizes the concept of a conceptually necessary or 'constitutive' property. The core idea is that certain concepts inherently require that any object to which they apply must possess specific properties. These properties are 'constitutive' of the concept. We would not apply the concept to an object or categorize the object within the specified concept unless it possesses these constitutive properties. For instance, it might be argued that being unmarried and male are constitutive properties for the concept of a bachelor, or that having a negative charge is constitutive for the concept of an electron. If something is not male and unmarried, we would not classify it as a bachelor; similarly, if something does not have a negative charge, it would not be considered an electron.\\n\\nIt is relatively straightforward to see how the notion of a constitutive property could be used to address the logical gap in eliminativist arguments. If it can be demonstrated that a certain property is constitutive for having propositional attitudes, then if science (or philosophical argument) can show that no one possesses that property, it follows that no one has propositional attitudes. For example, if having propositionally modular psychological states is constitutive for having beliefs and desires, then if people do not have such states, they do not have beliefs and desires. We are uncertain if anyone truly interprets eliminativist arguments in this manner, though several authors occasionally write as if they seriously consider the idea that certain properties are constitutive of the concept of belief, thus inviting this type of eliminativist argument (see, for example, Evans, 1982, pp. 65, 104; Clark, 1989, pp. 146-50; 1991a, b, s.II; Davies, 1991, p. 239ff). The closer one gets to Oxford, the more prevalent this discussion of 'constitutive' properties becomes. However, even if it is unclear whether anyone actually interprets eliminativism this way, it is evident that this strategy for bridging the gap in the eliminativist argument faces significant challenges.\\n\\nThe first challenge is substantiating the claim that a particular property is indeed constitutive for having propositional attitudes. For example, the mere fact (if it is indeed a fact) that many people believe or assume that beliefs are propositionally modular is not sufficient to establish that propositional modularity is constitutive for having beliefs. Nor would it suffice to show that many people would refuse to apply the term 'belief' to any state that is not propositionally modular. It might simply be the case that most people (or even all people) hold strong opinions about propositional attitudes, and these opinions are incorrect. There was a time when most people would have refused to apply the term 'star' to an object that did not revolve around the Earth. As we now know, they held deeply entrenched false beliefs about stars.\\n\\nFor those familiar with central themes in the philosophy of language over the past four decades, this first challenge suggests a second. The entire notion of constitutive or conceptually necessary properties seems to presuppose a distinction between analytic sentences (those that are 'true in virtue of their meaning alone') and synthetic sentences (those whose truth or falsity depends, in part, on the state of the world). If being unmarried is constitutive for being a bachelor, then presumably 'All bachelors are unmarried' is analytic. And if being propositionally modular is constitutive for being a belief, then 'All beliefs are propositionally modular' is analytic as well. However, Quine and others have presented influential arguments suggesting that no such analytic/synthetic distinction exists (see, for example, Quine, 1953; Harman, 1967). There are no sentences that are true solely by virtue of their meaning. If this is correct, then there are no constitutive or conceptually necessary properties.\\n\\nWe do not intend to review the arguments against the existence of the analytic/synthetic distinction. Indeed, for our current purposes, we need not even assume that the conclusion of those arguments is correct. All that is necessary for our purposes is the observation that the very existence of analytic truths, and thus of constitutive or conceptually necessary properties, is highly contested and problematic. Those who wish to fill the logical gap in the eliminativist argument by invoking the idea of constitutive properties owe us further argumentation. They must, at the very least, make it plausible that the arguments against the analytic/synthetic distinction are flawed and that the notion of constitutive properties is defensible. If there are philosophers who choose to pursue this path, we wish them well. However, we do not intend to hold our breath until they succeed.\",\n"," '**1.1 A Commitment to Common Sense Psychology**\\n\\nRSG base their primary argument on three commitments of common sense psychology regarding propositional attitudes: these attitudes are semantically interpretable, they have a causal role, and they are functionally discrete. RSG refer to this combination of features as propositional modularity (504). The first two aspects are well-known. Propositional attitudes are entities that can be true or false, satisfied or unsatisfied, and so forth; in contemporary terms, they possess content. Additionally, propositional attitudes influence behavior, belief formation, and similar processes in ways that align with their content. To assert that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete means they can have effects individually (or within content-based structures, such as when a conclusion is drawn from two premises without other propositions playing a role). RSG argue that distributed connectionist models do not meet the common sense requirement for functionally discrete states because, in these models, all information is encoded holistically—and thus inseparably—throughout the network.\\n\\nThey identify two distinct ways in which common sense propositional attitudes are functionally discrete. First, they can be acquired or lost individually (or nearly so). For instance, \"Henry...had completely forgotten that the car keys were hidden in the refrigerator\" (504-5), even though he had forgotten nothing else. If you are informed that the keys are in the refrigerator, you will gain a small cluster of new beliefs, but most of your existing beliefs will remain unchanged.\\n\\nThe second type of functional discreteness is more crucial to the argument. Sometimes, a person possesses a complete set of beliefs and desires that provide multiple reasons for performing an action, A. Occasionally, the person performs A for one of those reasons, with the other potential reasons not influencing the action at all. Similarly, a person may have several sets of beliefs that could lead her to infer a particular new belief, p, and she infers p from one of those sets, with the others not contributing to her reasoning. Thus, according to common sense psychology, it is a specific question which potential reasons for an action or change in belief were the actual or operative reasons.\\n\\nAccording to common sense psychology, then, the same state is semantically evaluable and has a content-appropriate, functionally discrete, causal role. Such states possess what RSG call propositional modularity. Functional discreteness is the feature on which the argument hinges. Since semantic evaluability and some form of causal role are generally assumed, we will typically refer to functional discreteness, reserving \\'propositional modularity\\' for contexts where semantic evaluability (or causal role) might be in question.',\n"," '**1.2 A Class of Connectionist Models**\\n\\nRSG argue that distributed connectionism inherently contradicts the concept of propositional modularity. They describe a specific class of connectionist models that they believe are incompatible with propositional modularity, particularly regarding the functional discreteness of semantically evaluable states. These models are defined by three key characteristics:\\n\\n1. Information is encoded in the connection weights and biases of units in a highly distributed manner, rather than being localized.\\n2. Individual hidden units within the network lack clear symbolic interpretation; they are subsymbolic.\\n3. The models are designed to represent cognitive processes, not just as implementations of cognitive models. (p. 508)\\n\\nFeatures (i) and (ii) ensure that specific information cannot be linked to particular local parts of the model. Connections and nodes are not semantically evaluable on their own or in small groups. Information is encoded holistically across the network or large sections of it. Each node contributes to representing multiple propositions, and each connection weight helps store various propositions. Consequently, information is contained holistically and globally within the network, not locally. RSG argue that this means all information in the network is involved in all processing, making it impossible to distinguish certain bits of information as operative and others as inoperative in a given process, as folk psychology suggests.\\n\\nFeature (iii), as RSG note, pertains to the interpretation of the network rather than the network itself. The model is intended to provide insights into how the mind functions, not merely how it might be physically embodied. Consider, for example, a classical parser—a traditional computer program designed to take natural language sentences as input and produce structural descriptions of those sentences as output. Such a program can be viewed as a hypothesis about the cognitive processes and knowledge structures involved in recognizing grammatical structures. The program can run on various computers with different machine languages; the cognitive hypothesis remains the same in each case. The machine language of the computer running the program is irrelevant to the cognitive narrative the program proposes.\\n\\nOne might attempt to use a connectionist network to implement the operation of such a classical program, treating the network as an alternative, unconventional kind of machine language. This approach would not alter the cognitive hypotheses proposed. This is the type of interpretation of connectionist models that feature (iii) excludes.\\n\\nHowever, a connectionist model—such as a parsing model like Berg (1992)—can also be interpreted as offering an alternative explanation of the cognitive processes involved in recognizing grammatical structures, competing with the classical model. This interpretation aligns with feature (iii), viewing the model as a cognitive model. Understood in this way, RSG assert that distributed connectionist models are incompatible with the propositional modularity of folk-psychological states.',\n"," '\\\\section*{RSG\\'s Observations}\\n\\nRSG note that the information encoded in Network A is stored in a holistic manner, distributed throughout the network. When information is extracted from Network A—by providing it with an input string and observing whether it computes a high or low value for the output unit—numerous connection strengths, biases, and hidden units contribute to the computation. Each weight, unit, or bias encodes information about multiple propositions. (513)\\n\\nThis accurately describes how the network functions. When determining the truth or falsehood of a proposition (i.e., high or low activation of the output node) from an input proposition, all hidden units and many weights are involved in the process. RSG argue that this holistic computation is incompatible, or \"radically incongruent,\" with the propositional modularity of common sense psychology.\\n\\nAs discussed in Section 3, common sense psychology generally assumes there is an answer to whether a specific belief or memory played a causal role in a particular cognitive episode. However, if belief and memory are supported by a connectionist network like ours, such questions seem to lack clear meaning. (513)',\n"," '**2. Critique of the Functional Discreteness Argument**\\n\\nOur critique is structured as follows: we identify three distinct ways in which intentional mental properties (state-types) can be present in a cognitive system (section 2.1). Based on this tripartite distinction, we explore various potential forms of functional discreteness. We argue that common sense psychology is committed to only one of these forms, leaving it an open empirical question whether the other forms are exhibited by propositional attitudes in humans (section 2.2). With this context, we present three separate responses to RSG\\'s argument.\\n\\nFirstly, connectionist models, including RSG\\'s Network A, typically demonstrate the sole form of functional discreteness to which common sense psychology is committed. Therefore, even if connectionism excludes some or all other forms, this would not conflict with common sense psychology. Instead, it would indicate that connectionism provides negative answers to certain empirical questions about functional discreteness that common sense psychology leaves unresolved (section 2.3).\\n\\nSecondly, even if common sense psychology were committed to the other forms of functional discreteness, and human cognition did not exhibit them, this would only suggest that common sense psychology is somewhat mistaken about propositional attitudes. It would not imply that propositional attitudes do not exist (section 2.4).\\n\\nThirdly, we contend that connectionism does not inherently exclude any of the other forms of functional discreteness. In principle, any or all of these forms could be present in a connectionist system where information is embodied holistically and distributedly in weights and activation patterns across nodes. Such functional discreteness would typically not involve distinct physical components in the network\\'s causal evolution; rather, it would be observable only at a more abstract, mathematical level of description, where the network is characterized as a high-dimensional \"dynamical system\" (section 2.5).',\n"," '**2.1 Psychological States: Occurrent, Dispositional, and Morphological**\\n\\nIntentional content or state-types can be possessed by humans and other cognitive agents in three distinct ways. The first two are commonly discussed in the philosophy of mind literature, while the third is less frequently mentioned.\\n\\nFirstly, a person can possess an intentional property occurrently. This implies that a specific instance of the psychological state-type manifests as a concrete event or state within the individual. In connectionist models, representations are patterns of activation that are interpreted as having intentional content. These patterns of actual, occurrent activation in the network are the concrete states that constitute its token representations, thereby serving as occurrent mental states in the model.\\n\\nSecondly, a person can possess an intentional state-type dispositionally. This means that the cognitive system is predisposed to generate a token of that type under suitable conditions, which will then have content-appropriate effects on the system\\'s cognitive processing and behavior. In connectionist models, dispositional intentional state-types are related to a network\\'s tendency (determined by its weights) to generate occurrent representations when appropriate.\\n\\nThirdly, a person can possess intentional content morphologically. Morphological possession of intentional content refers to the cognitive system\\'s disposition, due to its enduring structure rather than any occurrent states that are tokens of the content, to undergo state transitions systematically appropriate to that content. This occurs often without generating a token of the content during the process. Morphological content differs from occurrent representational content because it involves the cognitive system\\'s persistent structure rather than the occurrent tokening of the content. It also differs from dispositional representational content because the relevant dispositions associated with morphological content involve tendencies other than generating token representations with that content.\\n\\nFor example, consider a cognitive system that treats all members of a certain class, R, of representations similarly, making the same kinds of inferences from them. When it acquires a new representation in the same manner as the members of R, it tends to make similar inferences with the new representation. However, it does not make similar inferences from other representations. Thus, the system treats members of R as representations of the same type, effectively treating the kinds represented by the members of R as species of the same genus. Yet, the system may lack a representation for the genus itself, preventing it from representing the fact that two members of R are species of the same genus, even though it treats them as such. This scenario exemplifies purely morphological content.\\n\\nIn connectionist models, morphological possession of intentional content is embodied \"in the weights.\" The tendency to generate occurrent mental states when appropriate is also \"in the weights,\" making dispositional intentional states a special case of morphological content.\\n\\nCommon sense psychology attributes both occurrent and dispositional modes of possession to various state-types, including beliefs and desires. Dispositional beliefs and desires are unconscious states, while any conscious mental state is an occurrent state. However, common sense psychology allows for the conceptual possibility of unconscious occurrent beliefs and desires. There is no apparent reason why an intentional psychological theory could not include morphological content alongside occurrent and dispositional state types. Morphological content is consistent with common sense psychology, although common sense psychology does not necessarily commit to it.',\n"," '**2.2 Types of Functional Discreteness and Their Role in Common Sense Psychology**\\n\\nWith these distinctions in mind, let\\'s revisit common sense psychology\\'s stance on functional discreteness. Take, for example, RSG\\'s illustration involving Clouseau. Clouseau learns that the hotel is closed for the season and the train is out of service. However, the Butler claims he spent the night at the hotel and took the train back to town in the morning. Common sense suggests that Clouseau might deduce the Butler is lying based on his belief about the hotel being closed, the train being out of service, or both. From a common sense perspective, there is often a clear answer to which belief led to this inference. RSG argues that no definitive answer is possible if human cognitive systems resemble their Network A.\\n\\nWhy does common sense view this as a determinate question? The initial thought of a common sense psychologist is that it depends on which relevant beliefs consciously occurred to Clouseau and which logical connections he was aware of. If he consciously thought about the hotel closing and realized that its closure meant the Butler couldn\\'t have stayed there, but didn\\'t recall the train situation, it\\'s clear which belief was operative.\\n\\nConsider also RSG\\'s example of Alice the E-mailer. Alice had two reasons to go to her office: she wanted to talk to her research assistant, believing he would be there, and she wanted to send some emails, believing she could do so from the office. \"Common sense psychology assumes that Alice\\'s decision to go to her office might have been caused by either belief/desire pair, or both, and determining which is an empirical matter\" (p. 505). In RSG\\'s version, Alice\\'s desire to send emails was causally inert. Why? The most natural explanation is that it didn\\'t consciously occur to her at the relevant time, while her desire to talk to her research assistant did. The relevant time frame isn\\'t just the period immediately before her departure; she might have thought earlier, \"Oh, I need to talk to Fred today about...\" She could have then completed household chores, read the paper, prepared to leave, and departed without Fred re-entering her consciousness.\\n\\nThus, the paradigmatic cases of propositional modularity recognized by common sense psychology involve a causally active mental state that is occurrent and conscious, while the causally dormant state is dispositional but not occurrent. The type of functional discreteness to which common sense psychology is clearly committed is as follows:\\n\\n1. S1 is occurrent; S2 is dispositional but not occurrent.\\n   - Subcase: S1 conscious/S2 unconscious\\n   - (Here, S1 is the causally active state; S2 is a state that could have led to the same action or thought but did not in this case.)\\n\\nWe will call this subcase of type 1 functional discreteness \"paradigmatic functional discreteness.\"\\n\\nCommon sense also acknowledges that one might use information that doesn\\'t reach consciousness or arrive at a conclusion without conscious inference, especially during rapid physical activity. Thus, we should add a second subcase to type 1 functional discreteness: unconscious/unconscious.\\n\\nIt is not contrary to common sense to consider possible complications of paradigmatic functional discreteness, especially in explaining actions, decisions, choices, etc. Perhaps Alice is more interested in her email conversations than she admits. Her \"real\" reason for going to the office is to send emails, but she \"tells herself\" she\\'s going to talk to Fred. Her desire to send emails was occurrent and causally effective, but she suppressed awareness of its efficacy, and perhaps of the desire itself. This seems to be a case where both desires are tokened, but only one, the one not consciously considered, is the actual cause. Thus, common sense recognizes the possibility of a second type of functional discreteness:\\n\\n2. S1 is occurrent and S2 is occurrent.\\n   - (Conscious/conscious; conscious/unconscious; unconscious/conscious; unconscious/unconscious.)\\n\\nAll four subcases are conceptually possible, although the first might be questionable from a common sense perspective. It seems odd to suppose that Clouseau thought of the hotel closing, thought of the train being out of service, understood each was incompatible with the Butler\\'s statements, and inferred the Butler was lying from one belief but not the other.\\n\\nDispositional possession of an intentional state-type doesn\\'t directly cause an outcome the state-type could cause; rather, dispositional states enter the causal process indirectly via the occurrence of an occurrent token of that state-type. Case 1 involves a situation where the disposition to produce a token of S2 isn\\'t exercised during processing, making it a degenerate type of functional discreteness. It needs to be stated because it\\'s the one case of functional discreteness to which common sense is clearly committed. Given that intentional state-types that remain merely dispositional don\\'t play a causal role, three further cases are worth distinguishing:\\n\\n3. S1 is occurrent; S2 is morphological.\\n   - (Conscious/unconscious; unconscious/unconscious.)\\n4. S1 is morphological; S2 is occurrent.\\n   - (Unconscious/conscious; unconscious/unconscious.)\\n5. S1 is morphological; S2 is morphological.\\n\\nCommon sense allows for the conceptual possibility of each of Cases 3 through 5 because one can make intelligible, from a common sense perspective, the idea that morphological content has a causal role. For instance, consider this conversation:\\n\\nJ: The Parkers are at their place; the red flag is up on their mailbox.\\nN: Yeah, I saw their golden retriever last night.\\nJ: Oh, yeah; you told me that. I forgot.\\n\\nClearly, J inferred the Parkers\\' presence from the flag, not the dog. The flag is what he thought of. Had he remembered the dog, he might have realized he didn\\'t need to tell N about the Parkers. This story illustrates Type 1 functional discreteness.\\n\\nBut it illustrates more. To infer the Parkers were home from the raised flag, J must rely on something like (F) the flag is up on the Parkers\\' mailbox only when they are there to raise it. Likewise, when N inferred the Parkers were home, she relied on something like (D) the Parkers\\' golden retriever is there only when they are. Thus, we have instances of (F) and (D) exhibiting functionally discrete causal roles.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s unlikely that either (F) or (D) consciously occurred to J or N. We suggest it\\'s more likely that neither was subconsciously tokened either. If not, this isn\\'t a case of Type 1 or Type 2 functional discreteness. If the information (F) that played a role in J\\'s inference wasn\\'t tokened consciously or unconsciously, it was morphological rather than occurrent or merely dispositional. This seems to be a case of Type 5 functional discreteness. So, common sense permits the possibility of morphological content and Type 5 functional discreteness. (In Section 5, we offer an example of Type 4 functional discreteness, plus variants of RSG\\'s Clouseau example for each of Types 2-5.)\\n\\nOur main point in this section is that common sense is only committed to the paradigm case of functional discreteness, Type 1, where the causally active state is conscious. The other cases we have distinguished are recognized by common sense as possibilities, some as quite serious possibilities.\\n\\nIn Section 2.5, we argue that all five types of functional discreteness are possible in models within the class characterized by RSG.',\n"," '**2.3. First Reply: Compatibility of Folk Psychology and Distributed Connectionism**\\n\\nThe most straightforward response to RSG\\'s argument about functional discreteness is simple: the only type of functional discreteness that common sense psychology requires is paradigmatic functional discreteness. Connectionist models can easily demonstrate this form of discreteness. On one hand, the occurrent beliefs in common sense psychology align with specific activation patterns in a connectionist network, which influence processing through spreading activation. On the other hand, dispositional beliefs correspond to a network\\'s potential to generate these activation patterns, which act as representation tokens. If a disposition remains inactive, the corresponding activation pattern does not influence processing, as it is absent. Thus, connectionist models can accommodate paradigmatic functional discreteness: an activation pattern can serve as a token representation causing a specific outcome, while a dormant dispositional representation could cause the same outcome if activated. Therefore, the connectionist models discussed by RSG do not conflict with the functional discreteness required by common sense psychology.\\n\\nIn the rest of this subsection, we will expand on this response by examining (i) Network A as described by RSG and their comments on it, (ii) RSG\\'s responses to certain objections they consider, and (iii) recent comments on RSG\\'s modularity argument by Stich and Warfield (forthcoming).\\n\\nNetwork A contains two types of representations. The input layer represents questions about the truth or falsity of certain propositions, while the trained network represents answers to these questions. It represents propositions as true or false through activation patterns in the nodes, including input and output nodes.\\n\\nActivating a proposition in the input layer causes the output node to indicate true or false. The occurrent representation of the proposition triggers the recall of its truth value, while potential but non-occurrent representations do not influence the system. Thus, Network A, like other connectionist models, exhibits paradigmatic functional discreteness: occurrent representations have an effect, whereas non-occurrent representations do not.\\n\\nRSG suggest that beliefs in Network A are not occurrent representations in the input or hidden layers but rather the propositional information holistically embodied in the \"weights.\" They argue that since information is distributed throughout the network, the system lacks functionally discrete, identifiable sub-structures that can be interpreted as representations of individual propositions.\\n\\nThey contend that functional discreteness does not apply to propositional information embodied in the network\\'s weights and biases. Instead, all information encoded in the network\\'s connectivity matrix is causally involved in any processing the network undertakes.\\n\\nHowever, common sense psychology can accept that all information in the weights is involved in processing and still maintain that this does not contradict the kind of functional discreteness it requires. Information in the weights is analogous to morphological content, and common sense psychology is not committed to claiming that morphological content in humans exhibits functional discreteness. Whether it does is an empirical question. Thus, if some distributed connectionist models lack functionally discrete morphological content, it does not make them incompatible with common sense psychology; it simply answers the empirical question negatively for those models.\\n\\nRSG address the objection that (i) connectionist representations are activation patterns, and (ii) activation patterns are functionally discrete states. They argue that identifying beliefs with activation patterns is implausible because beliefs and propositional memories in common sense psychology are typically long-lasting and numerous, even when not in use. The counterargument is that only occurrent beliefs should be regarded as activation patterns in connectionist modeling.\\n\\nRSG also consider the idea that long-standing beliefs might be identified with dispositions to produce activation patterns, capturing the distinction between dispositional and occurrent beliefs in connectionist models. They argue that dispositions to produce activation patterns are not the discrete, causally active states required by folk psychology. The counterargument is that folk psychology recognizes the distinction between occurrent and dispositional beliefs and is not committed to the functional discreteness of dispositional beliefs as dispositional; it is only committed to paradigmatic functional discreteness.\\n\\nConnectionist representations generally have functionally discrete causal roles. Activated representations play a causal role in processing, while inactive ones do not. The specific causal roles of activated representations depend on patterns of spreading activation.\\n\\nStich and Warfield respond to a similar observation by Andy Clark, who suggests that only a \"belief-in-action\" needs to have functionally discrete causal potency. Stich and Warfield argue that this proposal is too weak, as no deterministic system storing propositional information could fail to satisfy propositional modularity. If true, nothing could demonstrate that such a system violates modularity and lacks beliefs.\\n\\nThe complaint is that, under the proposed interpretation of propositional modularity, no system could fail to exhibit functional discreteness. Our response is fourfold. First, Network A models a single cognitive step, such as rote recall, with no representation-level intermediaries. Given that the input and output are representations, and entered singly, nothing could show a lack of Type 1 functional discreteness. The occurrent representation in the input layer is causally active, while dispositional representations are not.\\n\\nSecond, this is not a valid complaint. Any immediate cognitive process with a single relevant input must exhibit Type 1 functional discreteness, regardless of determinism. This means that common sense psychology\\'s commitment to functional discreteness of propositional attitudes is weak.\\n\\nThird, it is possible to imagine connectionist models that do not exhibit functional discreteness for tokened representations. A model involving multiple simultaneous soft constraint satisfaction might have many active representations, making it difficult to determine which were causally responsible for a solution, especially if widely distributed. Systems with distributed representations can have many active representations through superposition, making it potentially impossible to separate causal contributions.\\n\\nFinally, common sense psychology is not committed to Type 2 functional discreteness. The only kind of functional discreteness it requires is trivially satisfiable.',\n"," '### 2.4 Second Reply: Ontologically Conservative Theory Change\\n\\nLet\\'s assume, for the sake of discussion, that our assertion is incorrect—that common sense psychology is not solely committed to the type of functional discreteness involving a conscious, occurrent belief and a non-activated dispositional belief. Instead, it might be committed to some or all of the other types outlined in section 2.1. Additionally, let\\'s consider (though we will contest this in the following subsection) that distributed connectionist models, as described by RSG, are incompatible with these additional forms of functional modularity. Do these assumptions validate RSG\\'s central claim: \"If connectionist hypotheses of the sort we will sketch turn out to be right, so too will eliminativism about propositional attitudes\" (p. 500)?\\n\\nCertainly not. RSG themselves differentiate between \"ontologically conservative\" theory changes, which retain the essential theoretical entities of an original theory while modifying or replacing its claims about those entities, and \"ontologically radical\" theory changes, where the entities posited by the old theory are entirely rejected. Even if common sense psychology is indeed committed to one or more types of functional discreteness from Type 2 to Type 5, modifying the theory by removing this commitment would be a relatively conservative change—especially since these are not classic examples of functional discreteness. Such a modification would not even come close to suggesting that beliefs do not exist.',\n"," '**2.5 Third Reply: Strong Forms of Functional Discreteness Are Not Precluded**\\n\\nDistributed connectionist models store information holistically, rather than in discrete items of propositional information within distinct internal states, structures, or processes. Information not currently represented is spread throughout the network, with each part contributing to the storage of much or all of its information. This suggests that distributed connectionist models might be incompatible with functional discreteness of Types 3-5, a notion that supports RSG\\'s argument. However, this perception is misleading, as we will briefly explain. We begin by exploring the concept of morphological content in connectionism and then discuss a common phenomenon that plausibly involves Type 4 functional discreteness, where morphological content overrides occurrent content. Finally, we revisit the example of Clouseau and the butler.\\n\\nThe appropriate mathematical framework for describing connectionist networks is dynamical systems theory, which involves mathematical concepts, techniques, and results. Describing a network as a dynamical system involves specifying its temporal evolution, both actual and hypothetical. Each node in the network is assigned a separate dimension or axis in a high-dimensional hyperspace, with possible activation values represented as points along that axis. Each possible total state of the system is thus represented by a unique point in the system\\'s \"state space\" (often called \"activation space\" in connectionist networks). The dynamical system is essentially the full collection of temporal trajectories the network would follow through its state space, with a trajectory emanating from each point it can occupy.\\n\\nThe dynamical system can be visualized as a high-dimensional geometric/topological object. A useful metaphor for dynamical systems is the notion of a landscape (in the case of networks, an activation landscape). Imagine the network\\'s n-dimensional activation space as a contoured n-dimensional surface, oriented \"horizontally\" in (n+1)-dimensional space. For each point p, the temporal trajectory the network would follow through its activation space if it evolved (without perturbation) from p is the path \"downhill\" along the landscape that a ball would follow if placed at p and allowed to \"roll.\"\\n\\nEach point on the activation landscape corresponds to a total activation state of the network. Certain points are representation-realizing points: when the network is in the total activation state corresponding to a given point, one or more representations are tokened as activation patterns. In general, representations are multiply realizable in connectionist models. Representations are identified with activation vectors, typically specifying activation values for only a relatively small portion of the network\\'s nodes. Such a vector specifies values for some, but not all, dimensions of activation space. All points that satisfy these values will realize the given representation. Additionally, several distinct representations can be realized by a single point in activation space, with the point\\'s coordinates simultaneously satisfying the coordinate specifications of several different vectors, each identified with a distinct representation.\\n\\nFrom the dynamical systems perspective, cognitive-level state transitions in a connectionist network are trajectories along the activation landscape from one representation-realizing point to another. These transitions depend on two interrelated factors: (i) the relative positions on the activation landscape of the representation-realizing points, and (ii) the topography of the landscape itself. Landscape topography is determined by the connections among the nodes and the weights on those nodes. \"Training up\" a network by progressively altering its weights according to some learning algorithm (e.g., backpropagation of error) amounts to progressively molding the activation landscape to result in systematically content-appropriate trajectories from one representation-realizing point to another. Learning involves modifying the existing activation landscape to accommodate new information while preserving information irrelevant to what is learned.\\n\\nLearning to make a certain class of inferences, for instance, produces a slope or incline on the activation landscape. From every point realizing a (possibly complex) representation of a certain kind, the system is inclined to proceed to a point realizing a corresponding representation of a different kind. The landscape also has other inclines, supporting potentially conflicting inferences one has learned to make, as well as various other inclines supporting different non-inferential content-appropriate tendencies to evolve from one representational point to another. Thus, the activation landscape is a very high-dimensional, subtly contoured space with multiple inclines. Being inclined to make an inference does not guarantee that one will make the inference.\\n\\nIn any particular cognitive trajectory along the activation landscape, information that is part of the content of representation-realizing points along that trajectory becomes occurrent, i.e., explicitly represented during the cognitive process corresponding to that trajectory. Conversely, information accommodated by the trajectory without being part of the content of any representation-realizing point on it is morphologically embodied rather than explicitly represented. The local topographical features of the landscape, i.e., the various superimposed inclines present in the immediate vicinity of a given representation-realizing point, determine the content-appropriate trajectory from any such point to another.\\n\\nOne common case of inclines in activation space involves representations thought of as attractor points or regions in activation space, with the basin of the attractor being the set of all points in activation space from which the system will evolve to the attractor. A basin is an incline where all individual slopes lead to the same place.\\n\\nFor a different example of an incline, consider a system that has learned to make a class of Humean inferences. Whenever it encounters an A, it expects a B. However, it has never occurrently represented the proposition that A\\'s are B\\'s and is not currently disposed to do so. If sophisticated enough, it might come to occurrently believe that A\\'s are B\\'s by reflecting on its own inferential tendencies, but it has not done so.\\n\\nIn such a case, the information that A\\'s are B\\'s is contained in the system morphologically (but not dispositionally or occurrently). There is an incline in its activation space connecting A-realizing points to B-realizing points, but no point in its current activation space realizes the belief that A\\'s are B\\'s.\\n\\nConsider now the phenomenon of prejudice. A person is strongly inclined to make certain judgments, J, about anyone (or anything) classified as being of a certain type, K. Occasionally, they feel the need to explain one of those judgments, sometimes due to external prompting, sometimes not. On these occasions, they provide an explanation for the particular judgment that does not refer to type K. Typically, the explanations given differ in different cases.\\n\\nThe prejudice consists of an incline in that person\\'s activation space from points realizing representations of individuals as being of kind K to points realizing J judgments about those individuals. The person may have little or no inclination to (occurrently) believe the generalization connecting K to J. (Being human, they have the capacity to entertain that generalization.)\\n\\nOften, when a J judgment is made, it is preceded by an occurrent representation, R, that the person presents to themselves or others as the reason for their J judgment on a particular occasion. However, R is causally inert. There is no path in activation space from points realizing R but not realizing a representation of an individual as of kind K to the J judgment. At the network level, there is no spreading of activation from R to J.\\n\\nThe incline (in activation space), i.e., morphological content, plays an actual causal role in bringing about the J judgment; the occurrent representation, R, does not. Thus, we have a conceptually possible case of Type 4 functional discreteness. Representation R might be a complex representation that fully justifies J, such as the premises of a valid argument for J. Yet K leads to J only in conjunction with the (mis)information morphologically embodied in the incline from K-realizing points to J-realizing points, and K leads to J in that case whether or not the inferential trajectory commences from an R-realizing point. Furthermore, the person need not consciously represent the fact that the individual is of kind K for their prejudice concerning K\\'s to come into play. (It is an interesting empirical question whether such a representation must be occurrent at all, even unconsciously.)\\n\\nConsider, in light of the foregoing discussion, RSG\\'s example of Clouseau. Suppose Clouseau\\'s internal network is at a point p in activation space that realizes the state-type B:\\n\\n(B) believing that the butler said he spent the night at the village hotel and that he said he arrived back on the morning train.\\n\\nSuppose Clouseau\\'s activation landscape has distinct, determinate inclines within it that respectively subserve trajectories appropriate to belief-types H and T:\\n\\n(H) believing that the village hotel is closed for the season.  \\n(T) believing that the morning train has been taken out of service.\\n\\n(We will call these inclines the H-incline and the T-incline, respectively.) In the immediate vicinity of point p on Clouseau\\'s activation landscape, the local topography is a complex contouring consisting of the superposition of various inclines, including the H-incline and the T-incline. Suppose that at point p, the T-incline and certain other inclines (not including the H-incline) effectively \"cancel each other out,\" i.e., when superimposed together, the T-incline and these other inclines jointly make no net contribution to the local topography in the vicinity of p. Finally, suppose that the dominant net effect, locally at point p, is contributed by the H-incline. So an inferential trajectory commences, emanating from p and terminating at a point p\\' which realizes the state-type L:\\n\\n(L) believing that the butler is lying.\\n\\nThis is a scenario in which Clouseau believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, he also believes that the morning train has been taken out of service, and he infers that the butler is lying based on the first belief but not the second.\\n\\nThis scenario can be further elaborated in several ways, corresponding to Type 2 through Type 5 functional discreteness. If the content of both belief H and belief T is only embodied morphologically in the H-incline and T-incline respectively, but neither content gets occurrently represented during Clouseau\\'s inferential process, then we get morphological/morphological functional discreteness: Type 5. But there are three other variants of the scenario, where the content of one or both beliefs also becomes occurrent, i.e., is part of the representational content of point p, or of some other point along the inferential trajectory commencing from p: H and T both occurrent (Type 2); H occurrent but not T (Type 3); T occurrent but not H (Type 4).\\n\\nIn conclusion, all four types of functional discreteness are conceptual possibilities under distributed connectionism. RSG are mistaken in assuming that functional discreteness of cognitive states can only occur if the content of those states is embodied in weights and/or activation patterns in a physically discrete manner.',\n"," '**3. The Projectable Predicates Argument**\\n\\nRSG briefly present a second argument for the fundamental incompatibility between connectionism and common sense psychology. Network A learned the truth values of sixteen propositions. RSG describe a second model, Network B, which learned the truth values of those sixteen propositions plus one additional proposition. The weights, biases, and internal activation values in processing differ between Networks A and B, and these differences do not correlate with the differences in what they have \"learned.\" Both networks represent the proposition that dogs have fur, among others. There are countless other connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur, differing in numerous ways from Networks A and B.\\n\\nFrom these observations, RSG argue as follows: common sense psychology treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of propositional attitudes as projectable. Thus, predicates like \\'believes that dogs have fur\\' or \\'remembers that dogs have fur\\' are projectable in common sense psychology. However, although there are many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur as effectively as Network A, these networks lack projectable features in common that can be described in the language of connectionist theory (p. 514).\\n\\nThe conclusion, therefore, is that common sense psychology treats a vast class of predicates as projectable, which connectionism renders non-projectable. According to RSG, projectable predicates are \"the sort of predicates that are appropriately used in nomological or law-like generalizations\" (p. 504). Hence, if connectionism is correct, there will be no states of the kind that these common-sense psychological predicates claim to ascribe.\\n\\nRSG claim not to find \"features in common that are describable in connectionist theory\" in Networks A and B. They likely view connectionist theory as the theory of networks: activation levels, the equations that determine them, weights, biases, and learning algorithms. Indeed, there are no projectable predicates here that correspond to the projectable predicates of common sense psychology.\\n\\nHowever, the projectable predicates of common sense psychology are \"predicates expressing the semantic properties of propositional attitudes.\" Connectionist theory also has predicates expressing the semantic properties of representations, such as \\'representation that dogs have fur.\\' A significant part of connectionist theorizing involves discussing representations. Read the description of any connectionist model, including RSG\\'s description of Network A! A key aspect of any connectionist model\\'s description is an account of the representations in the model and how they are realized in the network. The connectionist models central to RSG\\'s argument are, they insist, to be construed as cognitive models. If a model is construed as a cognitive model, then representations will be a central part of the theory of that model.\\n\\nThus, Network A and Network B do share a feature describable in the language of connectionist theory: they both represent the proposition that dogs have fur. They share this feature with all other actual and potential connectionist models that have a representation of the proposition that dogs have fur.\\n\\nFurthermore, connectionist representation predicates are projectable. For any reasonably successful connectionist model that has a representation of the proposition that dogs have fur, \\'representation that dogs have fur\\' will be a projectable predicate. If a model\\'s alleged representations are not projectable relative to the cognitive task being modeled, the model doesn\\'t work. The projectability of representation predicates relative to a model will depend on the cognitive task being modeled. This is expected, as cognitive models typically aim to model a single cognitive task or a small cluster of tasks, and the causal role of a representation relative to one cognitive task will differ from its role relative to different cognitive tasks.\\n\\nWhen the same network is trained on the same task more than once, there are differences in weights, biases, and activation levels of hidden nodes, but generalizations involving representation-level connectionist predicates are typically projectable from one trained network to another. Representation-level generalizations are similarly projectable when distinct networks implement the same cognitive model and when similar networks are trained on different but similar tasks (as were RSG\\'s Network A and Network B).\\n\\nGeneralizations involving representation-level connectionist predicates are not generally projectable from one connectionist model to others devoted to different cognitive tasks; the terms of such a generalization often do not apply to the other model. However, this is a result of the nature of cognitive modeling. In any case, it is not a departure from common sense. From the perspective of common sense psychology, the degree of projectability of generalizations involving propositional attitude predicates to other cognizers and other kinds of cognizers is quite variable and context-dependent. Thus, connectionism has projectable predicates—predicates assigning representations to network models—that align well with the projectable predicates of common sense psychology.\\n\\nWhen RSG state \"these networks have no projectable features in common\" (our emphasis), there is a sense in which this is true. The networks themselves have no projectable features in common. However, the models—the networks interpreted as performing a cognitive task—do have projectable features in common. Cognitive science is a branch of scientific theory that spans and interconnects several levels of description. Within classical, pre-connectionist cognitive science, the canonical articulation of the multi-level nature of the enterprise was given by David Marr, who wrote:\\n\\n\"At one extreme, the top level, is the abstract computational theory of the device, in which the performance of the device is characterized as a mapping from one kind of information to another, the abstract properties of this mapping are defined precisely, and its appropriateness and adequacy for the task are demonstrated. In the center is the choice of representation for the input and output and algorithm to transform one into the other. At the other extreme are the details of how the algorithm and representation are realized physically—the detailed computer architecture, so to speak.\" (1982, 24-25)\\n\\nMarr identifies three theoretically significant levels of description. The top level, the level of the mental qua mental, specifies a cognitive function: a transition function that pairs cognitive states with the appropriate cognitive successor states. The middle level specifies the algorithm by which that function is computed. The lowest level specifies the physical device in which the algorithm is implemented.\\n\\nAn algorithm, or program, is a mathematical object, a set of rules for manipulating symbols or data structures purely based on their formal/structural properties, independent of any intentional content they might have. Symbols and data structures, so described, are also mathematical objects. Thus, the middle level in Marr\\'s typology is a mathematical level of organization. This level of organization mediates between intentional mental states and their physical realization. Intentional mental states and state transitions are realized by certain mathematical states and state transitions, which in turn are realized by certain physical states and state transitions. The mathematical level is the appropriate one for characterizing the abstract system of functional/organizational features that constitutes Nature\\'s engineering design for human cognition.\\n\\nHowever, the discrete mathematics of algorithms is not common to all approaches to cognition. As discussed in Section 2.5, the natural mathematical framework for connectionism is the theory of dynamical systems. If cognitive transitions are not determined by algorithms over symbols, it need not be assumed that the potential cognitive transitions of a cognitive system constitute a tractably computable function. Marr\\'s tri-level typology for cognitive science can thus be seen as a species of a more generic tri-level typology:\\n\\n1. Cognitive State-Transitions: The level of the mental qua mental.\\n2. Mathematical State-Transitions: The level of functional organization.\\n3. Physical Implementation: The level of the physical qua physical.\\n\\nConnectionist cognitive models are another species of this generic typology, with the mathematics of dynamical systems as the natural mathematical framework at the middle level of description, and with connectionist networks (often as simulated on conventional computers) as the prototypical devices for physical implementation.\\n\\nIn both classical and connectionist cognitive science, theorizing involves the cognitive, the mathematical, and the physical levels of description and the interconnections among them. In both classical and connectionist cognitive science, predicates at each level of description are projectable, even though the state-types they express are multiply realizable at lower levels of description. To claim, as RSG do, that connectionist models that differ in the manner of their Network A and Network B \"have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of connectionist theory,\" is to ignore the fact that connectionist cognitive science includes two levels of description above the level of the physical qua physical.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{4. Conclusion}\\n\\nRSG contends that common sense psychology is incompatible with a specific form of connectionism because common sense psychology relies on the functional discreteness of propositional attitudes, whereas this form of connectionism does not support such discreteness. We identified three ways a cognitive system can possess intentional content: occurrently, dispositionally, or morphologically. By combining these methods of possessing content, we can conceptualize several types of functional discreteness. We argued that common sense psychology is committed only to the most benign form of functional discreteness—Type 1 functional discreteness—where occurrent representations have a causal impact, while merely dispositional ones do not. Almost any system with representations, including those in RSG's form of connectionism, will demonstrate Type 1 functional discreteness.\\n\\nCommon sense also acknowledges the potential for other types of functional discreteness that we have identified, and some of these possibilities offer intriguing perspectives on cognition. We suggested (in Section 2.5) that these other types of functional discreteness might be present in distributed connectionist models. Therefore, even if common sense psychology is more deeply committed to functional discreteness than we propose, RSG has not demonstrated that common sense psychology is incompatible with distributed connectionism.\\n\\nAdditionally, we argued (in Section 3), contrary to RSG's claims, that connectionist theory does possess projectable predicates comparable to the propositional attitude predicates found in common sense psychology.\\n\\nEven if we have successfully shown that RSG's arguments are not convincing, this only provides a limited defense of the compatibility between connectionism and common sense psychology. Other arguments exist (e.g., Davies 1991) that claim to demonstrate an incompatibility between connectionism and common sense. However, addressing these arguments and the issues they raise is a task for another time.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{2. The Example}\\n\\nImagine a scenario where a group of robots must learn to extend their arms to catch objects sliding off two sloped surfaces. To succeed, the robots need to predict when an object will slip off one or both slopes. They learn this by observing the angle of each slope, which varies unpredictably, making a prediction, and then verifying its accuracy. Each slope is independently set at different angles, resulting in two separate learning tasks that must be performed simultaneously.\\n\\nLet $A$ represent the event of an object sliding off the first slope, and $B$ the event of an object sliding off the second slope. Define $x_{1}$ as the angle of the first slope, measured as a fraction of $90^{\\\\circ}$, and $x_{2}$ as the angle of the second slope, similarly measured. Objects will only slide off if the slopes are set at an angle greater than $45^{\\\\circ}$. Thus, the propositions to be learned are: $A$ occurs if, and only if, $x_{1} > \\\\frac{1}{2}$, and $B$ occurs if, and only if, $x_{2} > \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\\n\\nThese environmental facts are depicted in Fig. 1. The state of the environment at any given time is represented by a point $\\\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\\\right)$ in the diagram. Whether one or both objects will roll off their slopes is determined by the state of the environment at that moment. ($\\\\bar{A}$ and $\\\\bar{B}$ denote the non-occurrence of events $A$ and $B$, respectively.)\\n\\nNow, suppose these robots are equipped with a standard feedforward backpropagation (bp) neural network, as shown in Fig. 2, where information about the slope angles is fed into the input nodes. They are trained with numerous $(x_{1}, x_{2})$ states randomly distributed within the unit square shown in Fig. 1. In each instance, the inputs lead to output activations $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$. These outputs trigger behavioral responses: if $y_{1} \\\\approx 1$, the robot reaches out to catch an object sliding off the first slope; if $y_{1} \\\\approx 0$, it does not. The response to the second slope is similarly determined by the state of $y_{2}$.\\n\\nWe assume that the robots' behavioral responses are based on their predictions about the occurrences of $A$ and $B$. However, when a prediction is incorrect (e.g., the robot reaches out but no object slides off, or it doesn't reach out and an object does slide off), an error feedback signal updates the connection weights in the neural network, as dictated by the bp algorithm. It is crucial to understand that information about the occurrences of $A$ and $B$ is eventually made available to the robots through a neurally accessible 'teacher' signal.\\n\\nGiven a sufficiently diverse training set, we can be confident that the robots will learn to respond correctly in all but the most challenging cases, where the slopes are very close to $45^{\\\\circ}$. Even without knowing the initial connection weights or the detailed list of training examples (except that it covers all regions of state space fairly well), we can make reliable predictions about the robots' post-training behavior.\\n\\nThese predictions are similar to those made by FP about human beings. In fact, we can express our predictions about the robots using FP concepts of belief and desire: after learning to solve the prediction problem, the robots develop two enduring beliefs: that $A$ will occur if, and only if, $x_{1} > \\\\frac{1}{2}$, and that $B$ will occur if, and only if, $x_{2} > \\\\frac{1}{2}$. At any given time, the robots also have temporary beliefs about the angles of the two slopes, which combine with their enduring beliefs to form predictions about the future occurrence or non-occurrence of $A$ and $B$. These beliefs drive the observed behavioral response.\\n\\nAn integral part of the FP narrative, if fully articulated, would be that the robots have separate beliefs about the two slopes, and only the beliefs about the first slope are relevant to the robots' response to that slope. This is worth stating because RSG claim that this kind of propositional modularity does not, and cannot, hold true for distributed representations in connectionist networks. For example, they argue that if both slopes are tilted greater than $45^{\\\\circ}$ and the robot moves to catch both objects, all (distributed) representations in the network are causally implicated in both outputs. Propositional modularity cannot be part of the connectionist explanation of the phenomena.\\n\\nRSG make this claim about both short-term (occurrent) and enduring (dispositional) belief states, and we plan to show that both claims fail in our example.\\n\\nThey concede that propositional modularity holds in cases where representations are not distributed across the entire network. It is possible for a spatially localized solution to develop as a solution to the learning problem in the described neural network. Suppose all the cross-connection weights in Fig. 2 are zero. Then, the enduring belief about the connection between the angle of the first slope and the sliding of objects on that slope will be encoded in the connection weights from the $x_{1}$ unit to $z_{1}$ and from $z_{1}$ to the $y_{1}$ unit. Clearly, the representation of that proposition will have no effect on the activation $y_{2}$, just as the thesis of propositional modularity states.\\n\\nWe agree that connectionist representations will seldom be spatially localized in this way. In fact, there are distributed weight configurations that solve our training problem. We will briefly describe one such solution, as the details are crucial to the argument. First, we argue for the modularity of the occurrent states, and then extend the discussion to enduring beliefs.\\n\\nSuppose both hidden units, $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, respond strongly to both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, but in different ways. They do so such that information about $x_{1}$ alone, or about $x_{2}$ alone, can be extracted from the hidden units by simply adding or subtracting the two hidden unit activations, respectively. Specifically, suppose the activations $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& z_{1} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\left(\\\\alpha_{1} x_{1}+\\\\beta_{1} x_{2}+\\\\text{bias}_{1}\\\\right)  & z_{2} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\left(\\\\alpha_{2} x_{1}+\\\\beta_{2} x_{2}+\\\\text{bias}_{2}\\\\right)\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere the 'bias' terms can be thought of as connection weights from units (not shown) that have a permanent activation of 1.\\n\\nFor example, suppose $\\\\alpha_{1}=\\\\beta_{1}=\\\\alpha_{2}=-\\\\beta_{2}$, and $y_{1}$ responds to the sum of $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ (i.e., $\\\\gamma_{1}=\\\\gamma_{2}$), while $y_{2}$ responds to the difference between $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ (i.e., $\\\\delta_{1}=-\\\\delta_{2}$). In this case, $y_{1}$ will not depend on $x_{2}$ even though $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ depend on both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, and $y_{1}$ depends on $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$. Similarly, $y_{2}$ will have no 'cross-dependence' on $x_{1}$. In this case, the information about the angles of the two slopes is encoded in the hidden units $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ in a distributed way. These are the non-localist representations that RSG claim cannot be functionally discrete. Yet, regardless of the angle of the second slope, the activation of $y_{1}$ is only affected by information about the first slope.\\n\\nThis conclusion follows from a simple 'wiggle' theory of causation: if you 'wiggle' the value of $z_{1}+z_{2}$ without wiggling the value of $z_{1}-z_{2}$ (and they can be wiggled independently), then the value of $y_{1}$ wiggles, but $y_{2}$ does not. Conversely, if you wiggle the value of $z_{1}-z_{2}$ without wiggling $z_{1}+z_{2}$, then $y_{2}$ wiggles and $y_{1}$ does not. This example establishes the kind of functional discreteness that RSG deny.\\n\\nThe causal facts are not mysterious. It is a case where the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{1}$ exactly cancels the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{2}$, resulting in a zero net effect. This situation is akin to two concentric solenoids wired in parallel, each inducing an equal but opposite magnetic field at their common center. As the voltage increases, the force exerted on the magnet in the middle by each solenoid increases, but there is no net effect—the magnet never moves.\\n\\nMore generally, the condition that $y_{1}$ does not depend on information about the second slope is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\beta_{1} \\\\gamma_{1}+\\\\beta_{2} \\\\gamma_{2} \\\\simeq 0\\n$$\\n\\nThis is most intuitively understood in reference to the leftmost subnetwork in Fig. 4. The term $\\\\beta_{1} \\\\gamma_{1}$ measures the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{1}$, and $\\\\beta_{2} \\\\gamma_{2}$ measures the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{2}$. Notice that the 'local' solution, where the cross connections are zero ($\\\\beta_{1}=\\\\gamma_{2}=0$), is just one special way of satisfying the condition. This condition implies that no (short-term) beliefs about the steepness of the second slope will interfere with how the robot acts towards the first slope, which is part of the modularity requirement imposed by FP. The modularity of occurrent beliefs is compatible with the distributed transmission of information through a connectionist network.\\n\\nBut what about the modularity of enduring beliefs? To answer this, we must first explain how enduring beliefs about the relationship between sliding objects and slope angles are represented in the network. Once learned, the proposition represented is '$A$ if, and only if, $x > \\\\frac{1}{2}$', as this is the fact relevant to solving the prediction problem. Moreover, the prediction problem is solved once the activation of $y_{1}$ matches the teacher signal, which records the (later) occurrence or non-occurrence of $A$. Thus, the proposition is successfully represented just in case the output is connected to the input so that\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\ny_{1}=1 \\\\text{ if, and only if, } A \\\\tag{1}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nat least approximately.\\n\\nFor example, the weights given in Fig. 3 ensure that the $y_{1}$ unit activation will be approximately 1 just in case its net input (excluding the bias) is greater than a 'threshold' level (100), and 0 otherwise. In these circumstances, the network successfully represents the proposition that the object on the first slope will slide off if, and only if, it is steeper than $45^{\\\\circ}$ because two conditions are met (see Appendix for the derivation). The first is a constraint on the subnetwork connecting $x_{2}$ to $y_{1}$, while the second is a constraint on the connections from $x_{1}$ to $y_{1}$ (Fig. 4):\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n& \\\\left(x_{2} \\\\rightarrow y_{1}\\\\right): \\\\beta_{1} \\\\gamma_{1}+\\\\beta_{2} \\\\gamma_{2} \\\\simeq 0  & \\\\left(x_{1} \\\\rightarrow y_{1}\\\\right):-\\\\text{bias}_{2} \\\\simeq \\\\gamma_{1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\text{bias}_{1}\\\\right)+\\\\gamma_{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\text{bias}_{2}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{11}{24}\\\\left(\\\\gamma_{1} \\\\alpha_{1}+\\\\gamma_{2} \\\\alpha_{2}\\\\right)\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nOn the other hand, the same network will also represent the proposition that the object on the second slope will slide off if, and only if, it is steeper than $45^{\\\\circ}$ just in case\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\ny_{2}=1 \\\\text{ if, and only if, } B \\\\tag{2}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThis leads to a different set of constraints on the connection weights, this time referring to the two subnetworks shown in Fig. 5.\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n& \\\\left(x_{1} \\\\rightarrow y_{2}\\\\right): \\\\alpha_{1} \\\\delta_{1}+\\\\alpha_{2} \\\\delta_{2} \\\\simeq 0  \\\\tag{2'} & \\\\left(x_{2} \\\\rightarrow y_{2}\\\\right):-\\\\text{bias}_{\\\\mathrm{b}} \\\\simeq \\\\delta_{1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\text{bias}_{1}\\\\right)+\\\\delta_{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\text{bias}_{2}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\left(\\\\delta_{1} \\\\beta_{1}+\\\\delta_{2} \\\\beta_{2}\\\\right) \\\\tag{2'}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nThe details of these equations are not crucial. The important point is that neither the conditions ($1^{\\\\prime}$), ($1^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}$), nor the conditions ($2^{\\\\prime}$), $\\\\left(2^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}\\\\right)$, uniquely determine values for the connection weights and biases—there are more 'unknowns' than equations. Each set determines a class of solutions. The particular solution 'chosen' by the network to solve one prediction problem (e.g., predicting $A$ from $x_{1}$) may or may not be in the second class of solutions. This allows for the causal modularity of representations encoded on the same set of connection weights and biases.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{3. Causal Modularity}\\n\\nWe are now ready to tackle the central question: when both 'beliefs' are present, as in our example, are both necessarily involved in the causal activation of the $y_{1}$ unit (and similarly for the $y_{2}$ unit)? It is evident that the connection weights $\\\\alpha_{1}, \\\\alpha_{2}, \\\\beta_{1}, \\\\beta_{2}$, and biases $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ play a role in both sets of conditions—(1') and (1'') as well as (2') and (2''). These weights are causally involved in the activation of $y_{1}$ and are part of both representations. Does this imply that both representations cause the output of $y_{1}$? We argue that this reasoning is flawed. Consider the following analogy: six people are involved in two different charity organizations, $A$ and $B$. Each person influences the actions of both organizations. However, it does not follow that organization $A$ is causally implicated in all activities of organization $B$. The answer is 'no' because the activities of organization $A$ might remain unchanged by the absence of what drives the activities of $B$, assuming other potential causes remain constant. It is possible, or even likely, that the causes of $B$'s activities are distinct and independent from those of $A$'s activities, despite the same group of people being involved in both. Only certain aspects of their behavior produce a given effect, and different effects may arise from different aspects of their behavior.\\n\\nWe will demonstrate that satisfying conditions (2') and (2'') is causally irrelevant to the activation state of $y_{1}$, even when both sets of conditions (1'), (1'') and (2'), (2'') are met. The test for causal relevance we will use is standard in probabilistic theories of causality (Eells, 1991), based on the 'wiggle theory' described earlier: alter the satisfaction of conditions (2') and (2''), while maintaining conditions (1') and (1''), and observe if there is a change in the activation of $y_{1}$. If 'yes', then conditions (2') and (2'') are causally relevant. If 'no', then the second representation is not causally relevant to the activation state of $y_{1}$, providing a concrete example of the propositional modularity of distributed representations, contrary to RSG.\\n\\nThe scenario we envision is this: both slopes are tilted at an angle greater than $45^{\\\\circ}$, and the robot extends two hands—one at the bottom of each slope. Both sets of conditions (1'), (1'') and (2'), (2'') hold, and the activations of both input units exceed $\\\\frac{1}{2}$. Now, imagine we keep all causal factors the same, except that the enduring belief about the second slope is absent. That is, the input activations remain the same, and conditions (1') and (1'') continue to hold, but conditions (2') and (2'') do not. Would there be a change in the activation of $y_{1}$?\\n\\nA brief examination of equations (1'), (1''), (2'), and (2'') will show that this test situation is clearly possible. So, imagine that one or both of the equations (2') and (2'') fail to hold, even approximately. There will be no change in the activation of $y_{1}$, since conditions (1') and (1'') and the $x_{1}$ input ensure that the activation is 1. The behavior towards the first slope is unaffected by the presence or absence of the enduring belief about the second slope. Even though the two representations are simultaneously encoded in overlapping sets of connection weights, one may be causally implicated in a behavior, while the other is causally inert. Thus, the functional separability of distributed representations establishes their causal modularity in this example.\\n\\nCertainly, the FP example that RSG uses is not completely analogous to ours, but a single example suffices to refute their claim. Nevertheless, it is instructive to repeat the argument in a more challenging case. Let's return to Alice: she went to her office because she wanted to speak to her research assistant, not because she wanted to send e-mail messages. Further, assume that Alice's desire to send e-mail messages would have caused her to go to her office had she not wanted to talk with her research assistant, but this is not what caused her to go to her office on this occasion. Examples like this are well-known as cases of causal overdetermination and are problematic for counterfactual theories of causation. Watson shoots at Moriarty a moment after Holmes fires. It is Holmes who kills Moriarty, even though the same effect would have resulted even if Holmes had not fired.\\n\\nRSG argue that FP states may exemplify such overdetermination, but the distributed representations of connectionist networks could not. To refute their claim in such cases, let us expand the robot example. Suppose that once the robots believe that one or the other of the objects will slide, they immediately proceed to noisily crank up their hydraulic pressure. We may assume that the pump is switched on by the activation of a node $C$. Its pattern of activation, in association with the beliefs that $A$ and $B$ (represented as $y_{1}=1$ and $y_{2}=1$, respectively), is shown in the table below (ignore the last column for now):\\n\\nNotice that if $B$ is believed ($y_{2}=1$), the state of $y_{1}$ causes no change in the activation of $C$. But can it make sense to say that, in the previous situation where both beliefs are present and the cranking behavior ensues, it was the activation of $y_{1}$, and not $y_{2}$, that caused the behavior? We maintain that such a claim makes perfect sense in the context of the connectionist model in Fig. 6.\\n\\nLet us assume that all the biases are zero, and the weights are as shown. Then this is how the network functions. In any case where $y_{1}=1$, an inhibitory signal is sent to the hidden unit $u_{2}$, preventing it from transmitting any information. That is, any signal from $y_{2}$ must overcome a threshold value of 100, which is impossible since the loudest signal from $y_{2}$ is 10. Therefore, unit $u_{2}$ will be 'off' regardless of the state of $y_{2}$. Since $y_{2}$ can only affect $C$ through $u_{2}$, it cannot affect it at all when $y_{1}$ is on. However, $y_{1}$ will turn $C$ 'on' via unit $u_{1}$. This accounts for the first two rows of the table above. In either of these cases, it is natural to say that the robot cranks up its hydraulic pressure because it believes an object will slide down the first slope, even though it may also believe the same about the second slope. This is true despite the fact that the robot would still have 'cranked up' in response to the second belief in the absence of the first (row 3 in the table). In this case, there is no inhibitory signal to block the influence of $y_{2}$ on $C$, and $C$ will be 'on' if, and only if, $y_{2}$ is 'on'. The situation is completely analogous to Alice going to her office because she wanted to talk to her research assistant, despite the fact that she would have gone to her office anyway. Or to the situation where Moriarty would have died from a bullet wound even if Holmes had not fired his pistol.\\n\\nOne reviewer suggested that the RSG example might be interpreted differently. Perhaps Alice's going to her office was not overdetermined by her desire to send e-mail messages, even though that desire was present and a potential cause. Perhaps she would not have gone to her office at all if her desire to talk to her research assistant (the actual cause) had not been present. These causal facts are easily accounted for in a connectionist model. We only need to assume that the state of some third node ($D$ in Fig. 7) serves to inhibit the causal activation of Alice's desire to send e-mail messages. That is, the activation of $y_{1}$ produces the activation of $C$, but this would not occur without $y_{1}$ since the only other potential cause, $y_{2}$, is inhibited by node $D$.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is nothing in the underlying neural level story that contradicts the causal narrative that FP constructs around the same events.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{4. The General Nature of the Argument}\\n\\nOur analysis of the robot example demonstrates that the claim made by RSG regarding propositional modularity is overly assertive. However, what insights have we gained about other connectionist models, and what can we anticipate about the causal modularity of models that are more biologically plausible than those currently under consideration?\\n\\nOur argument specifically relied on the ability to alter the satisfaction of conditions ($2^{\\\\prime}$) and ($2^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}$) without affecting the satisfaction of conditions ($1^{\\\\prime}$) and ($1^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}$). In our example, this is a mathematical certainty. Figure 8 provides an abstract representation of this scenario. Each point on the diagram corresponds to a specific set of values for the network's weights and biases, similar to the example in Fig. 3. The solution set for the first prediction task represents the range of possible network states that successfully solve that task. The same applies to any other prediction problems. Claiming that a simultaneous solution to tasks 1 and 2 is feasible implies that the intersection of their respective solution sets is non-empty. Our argument, however, relied on the additional assumption that there are states within the solution set for task 1 that do not solve task 2. This might only be true in our network because it includes several unnecessary connections and hidden units [10].\\n\\nFirstly, a general observation: some redundancy in weights and hidden units in connectionist models of human cognition contributes to their biological plausibility. This redundancy allows for the graceful degradation of cognitive abilities and a relative insensitivity to brain damage (mere distributiveness does not ensure these properties).\\n\\nIn the following discussion, we introduce a new and specific reason why network architecture must be sufficiently redundant to solve task 1 without solving task 2 (as well as solving both simultaneously). The concept is straightforward: any connectionist model of human cognition must accommodate the simultaneous solution of various prediction tasks. We refer to this property as learning adaptability. Specifically, we assume that the network can simultaneously solve task 1 with task 2 and task 1 with task 3, where the solution set for task 3 does not overlap with that of task 2 (see Fig. 8). For instance, suppose the world is such that $B$ occurs if and only if $x_{2}$ is less than $\\\\frac{1}{2}$, rather than greater than $\\\\frac{1}{2}$. In this scenario, the task is to align the activation of $y_{2}$ with the occurrence of $B$. This task is incompatible with task 2, as it requires the weights and biases to activate the $y_{2}$ output with $x_{2}$ inputs of less than $\\\\frac{1}{2}$. Learning adaptability necessitates that a network be versatile enough to handle various learning situations. Indeed, we might consider this adaptability as one of the core aspects of human intelligence [11].\\n\\nFrom the assumption of learning adaptability, it follows that there exists a network state that solves tasks 1 and 2, and another that solves task 1 but not task 2. Consequently, the representations developed to solve tasks 1 and 2 are functionally distinct, as required. Once this is established, we can apply standard tests of causal relevance to determine the causal modularity of representational states, as demonstrated in our simple example.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{5. Projectibility}\\n\\nRSG argue that the incompatibility between folk psychology (FP) and connectionism can be understood by considering that FP's natural kinds are, or claim to be, projectible, whereas connectionism lacks similar projectible predicates. RSG train one network (Network A) on 16 related propositions and another (Network B) on those 16 plus an additional one. They highlight that:\\n\\nIn semantic network models and other traditional cognitive models, it is straightforward to identify which states or features of the system encode the added proposition and to determine whether the representation of the added proposition influences a particular episode modeled by the system. However, in the connectionist network, these questions are nonsensical. (p. 212)\\n\\nThe issue seems to be that the two networks differ so significantly that there are no commonalities to base judgments on regarding which differences are insignificant. RSG conclude:\\n\\nThe lesson here is that although there are countless connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur as effectively as Network A, these networks lack projectible features that can be described in the language of connectionist theory. From the perspective of the connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind but rather a chaotically disjunctive set. Common sense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a psychologically natural kind; connectionist psychology does not. (p. 213)\\n\\nGoodman (1965) introduced the term 'unprojectible' to argue against using successful past predictions of grue-like hypotheses as confirming instances. 'Projectible' is not synonymous with 'natural kind' because many perfectly projectible predicates are not 'natural' in any intuitive sense. Not all projectible predicates need to be 'natural' kind terms in an obvious way, and our robot example illustrates this. Given that the entire population of robots shares the same neural architecture, conditions (1') and (1'') meaningfully apply to all of them. Moreover, satisfying these conditions is extremely useful in successfully projecting the behavior pattern of one robot to all others, regardless of other beliefs they may have acquired. The conditions (1') and (1'') may not appear very 'natural' or familiar, but they are not grue-like. Our example demonstrates that there may be predicates in connectionist psychology that rival the predictive power of FP predicates.\\n\\nRSG might argue that FP predicates claim to be more universally projectible and that any coextensive neural predicate would have to be 'chaotically disjunctive' to encompass the vast variety of possible neural architectures. But why does this matter? Let us concede that the predicate may not be very 'natural' from a neural standpoint. Why does this indicate the incompatibility of connectionism and FP? At most, the argument makes a methodological point: it would be challenging, if not impossible, for neuroscience to discover these more universally projectible predicates if limited to its own resources. The argument does not demonstrate that no such projectible predicates exist, which is what RSG need to establish incompatibility.\",\n"," \"### 3. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon's Argument\\n\\nRamsey, Stich, and Garon (RSG) present a critique of the theory they aim to challenge, followed by a characterization of the Connectionist theory they propose as a replacement for folk psychology. We will refer to this as 'Connectionism RSG'. Their main assertion is that networks of this type cannot be comprehended within the framework of folk psychology because it is impossible to identify symbols that meet the constraints of propositional modularity within the network. RSG examine potential candidates for semantically interpretable symbols within the system's states and find that they are not functionally discrete, thus disqualifying them as folk psychological symbols. Since folk psychology allows intelligence to be instantiated only in systems with states that meet the three specified criteria, RSG conclude that folk psychology is incompatible with Connectionism RSG. Consequently, if Connectionism RSG succeeds as an explanation of cognition, folk psychology cannot.\\n\\nBeyond the input layer and the output node, it is challenging to identify any form of 'propositional representation' or 'distinct symbolic expression' that can be semantically interpreted. This is exemplified by the difficulties encountered in pinpointing failure when training a network. If the network fails to exhibit the desired behavior during training, it is often impossible to identify a specific node or group of nodes responsible for the failure. The key point is that the system's 'knowledge' is distributed throughout the network, not localized. Moreover, the most apparent candidates for symbolhood, such as the weights of the connections and the threshold values at the nodes, do not satisfy the constraints of folk psychology. An example is provided with two networks (networks A and B, as shown in Figures 1 and 2) trained on nearly identical sets of propositions (see Figure 3). The only difference is that network B has been trained on one additional proposition not used in network A's training. Examining network A, which behaves like many classical models when asked to confirm or deny propositions, reveals no functionally discrete state or part that represents a particular proposition. Comparing the two networks, an inspection of the connection weights and thresholds shows no projectable features that can explain the similarities and differences in their behavior. Since no such discrete states (symbols) exist, it cannot be determined if they play a causal role in the network's computation. The main point is summarized as follows:\\n\\nBoth the problem of localizing failure and the absence of projectable features demonstrate that the folk psychological condition of discreteness is violated. No analysis of the network can provide discrete entities with the appropriate semantic features that are also causally efficacious, and thus no folk psychological symbols exist.\\n\\nIt is indeed true that an immediate inspection of the networks used by RSG does not reveal any clearly marked symbols, nor is it evident what projectable features the different networks share or differ in. If we accept that there is no symbolic interpretation to be made of the network, then it seems we must accept that folk psychology cannot explain the network. If folk psychology cannot encompass explanations that include this network or any cognitive model using Connectionism RSG architecture, then we must accept that the success of Connectionism RSG as a general theory of cognition poses a threat to folk psychology.\\n\\nThis network as a whole might be construed as the means by which a single folk psychological symbol could be found in a cognitive system. Hybrid models of this sort have been proposed (e.g., Harnard [1989]); however, RSG reject this approach. A hybrid would not present a problem for folk psychology, as folk psychology is uncommitted to how its symbols and their interactions might be instantiated, apart from the propositional modularity requirement. Folk psychology does not require that the internal structure of symbols themselves be explained by further symbolic manipulation, only that a symbol, once instantiated as a unit, be functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, and causally efficacious. Instead, RSG suggest that an extended version of their simple network will, as a whole, instantiate a full cognitive agent. They claim that Connectionism RSG, as a theory, must compete with folk psychological theory, as such an agent will lack the necessary folk psychological entities. Connectionism RSG will thus be able to explain cognitive phenomena that folk psychology cannot. If RSG can demonstrate this, they have made a significant claim. Folk psychology asserts that all cognitive phenomena (at the appropriate level) fall within its explanatory domain, so a model of cognition that does not allow for a folk psychological explanation of clearly intelligent behavior would show that folk psychology does not have a monopoly on explanatory power in the cognitive domain. This is acknowledged by Fodor and Pylyshyn, who, in their 1988 work, make extensive efforts to show that Connectionism cannot fulfill the explanatory requirements of a cognitive theory.\",\n"," '**4. Dispositions**\\n\\nIn their paper, RSG briefly address replies and objections to their position, dismissing them without substantial argument. However, it is not entirely clear that they have effectively countered these critiques as they claim.\\n\\nIn the section titled \"Objections and Replies,\" RSG consider the suggestion that, in the case of network A, the various 4-tuples of activation of the hidden units, which correlate with the \\'processing\\' of a query, might be viewed as folk psychological symbols. For instance, when the proposition \"Dogs have fur\" is presented in its symbolically coded form at the input, the resulting 4-tuple of activation values at the four hidden units can be seen as the functionally discrete state encoding the \\'knowledge\\' that dogs have fur. These activation patterns appear only at specific times due to specific inputs, leading RSG to entertain the idea that the disposition to exhibit the 4-tuple \\\\(\\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{x}} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4})\\\\), corresponding to the activation values of the four hidden units, is the actual symbolic state representing proposition \\\\(X\\\\). A defense of folk psychology along these lines, specifically referencing RSG, is found in Jackson and Pettit [forthcoming b]. I was initially drawn to this type of defense, as it addresses RSG\\'s claims about the irrelevance of folk psychology to Connectionist networks. Ultimately, I believe it fails to identify symbols with the precise properties needed to satisfy propositional modularity. Nonetheless, it is worth examining briefly to clarify the type of representations we should ultimately seek.\\n\\nThe system\\'s disposition to produce a pattern of activation appears to correlate with folk psychological ontology (e.g., the disposition to produce a certain 4-tuple could correspond to the network believing that \"Dogs have fur\"). It possesses the discrete properties required by folk psychology, as such dispositions are semantically interpretable as discrete propositions (constraints 1 and 2 in section 2). According to RSG, however, the issue is that these dispositions cannot be considered causally effective in a functionally discrete manner. They use the example of Inspector Clousseau, who believes \\\\(Q\\\\), believes \\\\(R\\\\), believes that \\\\(Q \\\\rightarrow P\\\\), and believes that \\\\(R \\\\rightarrow P\\\\), and comes to believe \\\\(P\\\\). From the perspective of folk psychology, it makes sense to ask, \"Was it the belief that \\\\(Q\\\\) which led to the belief that \\\\(P\\\\), was it the belief that \\\\(R\\\\), or was it the belief that both \\\\(Q\\\\) and \\\\(R\\\\)?\" But in the case of the network, this query becomes, \"Was it the disposition to exhibit activation pattern \\\\(q\\\\), or the disposition to exhibit activation pattern \\\\(\\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{r}}\\\\), or both, which caused the disposition to exhibit activation pattern \\\\(\\\\underline{p}\\\\)?\"\\n\\nFollowing Armstrong [1973], dispositions can be considered as having an underlying physical basis, the \\'categorical basis\\'. The dispositional account of neural network behavior may be more convincing if we show that the dispositions are shorthand for physical states and processes. The flaw in the dispositional account, as described by RSG, is that dispositions cannot be said to cause anything in a functionally discrete way. However, if the disposition is merely a convenient shorthand for a complex physical state, then that complex physical state might indeed cause things in the discrete way required. There are two important points to consider regarding why dispositions can be considered causal in a functionally discrete way: first, the physical basis of dispositions means they can be thought of as causal agents; and second, counterfactuals about the role of a dispositional representation could clarify the functional role of a given disposition.\\n\\nFirstly, Jackson and Pettit [forthcoming b] discuss conductivity concerning the discreteness of dispositional properties (ms. p. 9ff), noting that there are numerous dispositional properties of metals, for example, which all share the same physical basis—the sub-atomic and atomic structure of the metal in question. This single categorical basis gives rise to conductivity, ductility, and opacity, among other dispositional properties. However, only one of these dispositions needs (or indeed should) be cited in a causal account of the metal\\'s behavior. In Jackson and Pettit\\'s example, a person dies when she allows her ladder to touch power lines. She dies because the ladder is an electrical conductor, not because it is opaque, despite both the ladder\\'s opacity and electrical conductivity having the same physical basis. Similarly, in a Connectionist network, all the beliefs stored in one network have the same physical basis, but only one of the dispositions (to exhibit a certain activation pattern) will be cited in a causal account of the network\\'s behavior; only one of the dispositions needs to be realized in a given situation. Since a given disposition can be properly invoked in a causal account, while other dispositions sharing the categorical basis of the first will not be, it is clear that dispositions can be said to be causal in a discrete way.\\n\\nSecondly, we can pose \\'what if\\' questions to determine the functional role of a given disposition. If the disposition to exhibit \\\\(q\\\\) was absent from the network, and it was found that in this case, the network did not come to have the disposition to exhibit \\\\(\\\\underline{p}\\\\), then surely the representation of \\' \\\\(Q\\\\) \\' has played a causal, and functionally discrete, role in the representation of \\' \\\\(P\\\\) \\'? This suggests that one way of determining the functional role of a disposition would be to posit a counterfactual: \"If the system did not \\'know\\' (wasn\\'t trained to recognize) \\\\(Q\\\\) (or \\\\(R\\\\)), would it have still deduced \\\\(P\\\\) in the same way?\" In the example posited, there are actually four possible answers, each of which is intelligible in folk psychological terms. First, if the training of the network on \\\\(R\\\\) makes no difference to the production of \\\\(P\\\\), then we can conclude that \\\\(Q\\\\) led to \\\\(P\\\\). Secondly, the training of the network on \\\\(Q\\\\) makes no difference, hence \\\\(R\\\\) led to \\\\(P\\\\). Thirdly, neither \\\\(Q\\\\) nor \\\\(R\\\\) makes a difference, hence \\\\(P\\\\) was not concluded from \\\\(Q \\\\rightarrow P\\\\), nor from \\\\(R \\\\rightarrow P\\\\). Fourthly, both \\\\(Q\\\\) and \\\\(R\\\\) are necessary for \\\\(P\\\\), hence the network concluded \\\\(P\\\\) from \\\\((Q \\\\& R) \\\\rightarrow P\\\\). If we can answer this sort of question, then we can be sure that the relationships between the representations of \\\\(P\\\\), \\\\(Q\\\\), and \\\\(R\\\\) are causal, and we can comfortably identify the discrete role of each proposition the network encodes.\\n\\nWe can be confident that dispositions are capable of causal agency and that if the counterfactuals discussed can be answered sensibly, then the dispositions clearly have an explanatory role, thus preserving an Instrumentalist position like Dennett\\'s. However, propositional modularity demands that symbols be able to \\'interact\\' with each other in some way and that their physical interactions can give rise to other symbols. If the categorical basis of a disposition is the whole network, or at least the same for each symbol, then there is a problem in suggesting that the symbols can interact in the way required by propositional modularity. Something cannot be said to \\'interact\\' with itself, nor do we typically talk of a ladder\\'s opacity and conductivity causally interacting with each other. Without the ability to causally affect each other, candidate symbols do not satisfy the causal effectiveness requirement of propositional modularity and thus are not the symbols required by folk psychology. If we are to reject RSG\\'s claim that Connectionism is incompatible with folk psychology, we need symbols that are more than explanatorily useful—we need symbols that are fully propositionally modular. Any symbols in the network need to be able to \\'interact\\' with each other in such a way that computation is effected. To identify such symbols, we\\'ll first have to take a closer look at RSG\\'s example.',\n"," \"# 5. A Connectionist CPU?\\n\\nRSG emphasize the explanatory demands of folk psychology in their discussion of Inspector Clousseau. In folk psychology, explanations of deduction require it to be clear which of several possible antecedents was instrumental in reaching a conclusion. However, RSG provide limited insight into how Connectionism, as they define it, could embody a deductive system. There is no demonstration that a Connectionist network, as proposed by RSG, could deduce new information in a way that aligns with or explains the deductions made by Inspector Clousseau.\\n\\nInterestingly, the network example provided by RSG does acquire new information. As noted on page 516, the network generalizes from the 'knowledge' that dogs have fur, paws, fleas, and legs, and that cats have fur, paws, and fleas, to the 'knowledge' that cats have legs. This ability to perform (in this case, correct) induction is noteworthy and significant; however, it does not challenge the folk psychology account of deduction. RSG correctly assert that folk psychology will demand answers to questions like whether Inspector Clousseau inferred P from Q or from R. However, a network that exhibits induction does not immediately clarify how a folk psychological account might align with a network model of deductive behavior.\\n\\nThis issue highlights the enormity of the task RSG have undertaken, as their very small, very simple network is intended to illustrate a complete model of cognition. Another significant problem with RSG's example is its static nature—it is permanently committed to the input/output relations it currently exhibits. Upon completing training, any 'knowledge' the system possesses is already present. The network has already concluded that cats have legs long before it was ever asked. The question of how it performs induction pertains to the training history, not the completed network.\\n\\nRSG challenge folk psychology to identify symbols within their network. We have identified states, in the form of dispositions to exhibit activation patterns, that perform the explanatory work of symbols, if not the causal work. RSG suggest that a Connectionist network manipulates symbols as if by magic: if you input symbols into the black box, other appropriate symbols emerge, but don't inquire about the internal workings. Although they claim Connectionism to be a psychological theory, they provide no explanation beyond connection strengths and biases. Somehow, the relationships between input propositions are recognized by the black box, and if we believe folk psychology encompasses such networks, we need to demonstrate how these relationships are recognized in a manner compatible with folk psychological demands for propositional modularity.\\n\\nFirst, we should acknowledge that the coding of input propositions clearly meets the criteria of propositional modularity. From Figure 3, we can infer that the coding for 'dogs' is the 8-bit binary word 11000011, and 'have legs' is 00111100, resulting in the 16-bit input representation 1100001100111100 for 'dogs have legs'. During the training process, we might prefer to rely on these propositionally modular representations as the causal agents by which inference is effected. Remembering that RSG's example, as it stands, doesn't accomplish much, and certainly doesn't perform any inference after training is complete, we must examine the training history to understand what's happening.\\n\\nIn simple systems like RSG's examples, we can see that the network is a mechanism for the causal interaction of input representations. 'Dogs have fur', 'Cats have fur', and so on, are compared by the network (even though the two representations are not presented simultaneously to its input), and the result of the comparison is available to the output. The appropriate analogy here is with a von Neumann CPU, as a standard CPU is also a mechanism for the causal interaction of propositional representations (typically a machine code command and a value in the accumulator or some other immediately accessible memory). If we view the network as a processing device, the effect of one symbol's interaction with the network is stored in the network's structure, influencing the effect of the next symbol's interaction, all occurring during training. Unlike a CPU, however, a network needs to be presented with an input multiple times to respond appropriately. I don't mean to suggest that this example network and a von Neumann CPU are involved in the same computations—CPUs don't perform induction, just as RSG's network doesn't perform deduction. However, I do claim that there is no mystery in the network's ability to sensibly utilize relations between propositions (like the inferability of 'cats have legs' from the rest of the data set).\\n\\nThe key shift in interpretation here is viewing the network not just as a storage device (as emphasized by RSG) but as a processor (suggesting a comparison with a CPU). We are interested in RSG's network as a (prototype) cognitive model not just because it can store information, but because it can learn and infer. Given this, perhaps we can view a Connectionist network as a sophisticated way of allowing symbols to 'interact'. We should remember that any system manipulating representations must ultimately have a form of computation following rules tacitly represented in the system—there must be a point where the system stops referencing more explicitly represented rules. In a CPU, the system is wired so that the representation corresponding to a command (say LD 2) 'interacts' with the representation of a certain value (a binary number in the accumulator) in just the right way, so the register labeled 2 contains the value previously in the accumulator. The CPU just knows how to execute the program command without referencing other symbols.\\n\\nA cognitive system (or subsystem) like RSG's networks can be considered a sophisticated way of allowing propositional representations to interact—not by having the symbols interact simultaneously, but by storing the effect of symbolic representations so that each new representation interacts in a well-defined way with all previous symbolic representations. A network that remembers, like RSG's, rearranges its input/output relationships so that the effect of one proposition's representation is considered when other representations 'interact' with it through the network. A von Neumann CPU can process a limited number of symbolic representations at a time (one command, possibly an argument to that command, and the current value of the accumulator). A Connectionist network can be seen as a more complex CPU, permitting the interaction of many symbols 'at once' through a sophisticated 'summation' of input representations, accumulated over the training period. The network just knows how to provide a result from the simultaneous processing of numerous inputs.\\n\\nIn all physical symbol systems, there is a stage where the interaction of symbols must be explained through the physical characteristics of the symbols and their operating environment. In a CPU, we must eventually refer to patterns of electrical activity and hard-wiring to show exactly what it is about the binary representation of LD 2 that places the current contents of the accumulator in register 2. In a Connectionist system, the causal interaction of symbols must also be described non-symbolically. It is the network's wiring (described by its set of weights and thresholds) that determines the effect of two symbols interacting through the network; but this doesn't mean symbolic computation isn't occurring. The network calculates a relationship between input representations purely based on their physical syntactic properties. The relationship calculated by the network is novel, not the fact that it can perform this type of calculation. Just as RSG's simple network performs some form of induction on its inputs, a Connectionist network capable of deduction would be able to appropriately process Q and Q → P without both symbols being present at its input simultaneously.\\n\\nThe basic idea, then, is to interpret Connectionist networks as processors of propositional representations. Just as with a von Neumann CPU, there is a point where we must stop searching for propositional representations within the device and explain its behavior by appealing to the physical (syntactic) properties of the input and output representations. Under this interpretation, folk psychology is not threatened by Connectionism, as folk psychology can account for a network's behavior just as well as it can account for a standard CPU's behavior. It does so by appealing only to symbols that unproblematically satisfy the criteria for propositional modularity (those at the input and output) and to the physical (syntactic) properties of those symbols.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{6. Has Folk Psychology Been Saved?}\\n\\nThe approach proposed here requires examining RSG's examples with a different focus than they originally provide. Propositional modularity, through its requirement for causal effectiveness, emphasizes commitment to process rather than storage, as acknowledged by RSG in their central folk psychological example of Inspector Clousseau. The key point in these examples is not that information must be stored in a propositionally modular manner, but that it must be used in such a way. For folk psychology to hold true, when we explain an inference using the proposition $Q$, we expect a propositionally modular symbol of $Q$ to be identifiable at an appropriate location in the system, allowing it to causally interact with other symbols. This is the central demand of folk psychology, not that storage be immediately identifiable as propositionally modular.\\n\\nIn this context, it is important to remember that propositional representations in von Neumann computers are not immediately recognizable as propositionally modular. However, a von Neumann computer converts the representation in memory into a propositionally modular form at the input to the CPU for processing when the representation needs to be used. My suggestion is that a Connectionist RSG network is simply a different, more complex, and potentially more powerful way of enabling propositional representations to causally interact with each other in a semantically meaningful way. RSG's Connectionist system processes folk psychological symbols purely based on the syntactic features of those symbols. No magic is required.\\n\\nA few caveats are necessary here. Firstly, this approach to Connectionism RSG is limited to networks with propositional inputs and outputs. Many examples in the general field of PDP involve input codings that are not clearly propositional, so this argument does not immediately apply to them. Secondly, it might be argued that the complexity of the primitive operations over symbols in Connectionist RSG networks is much greater than that of the primitive operations over symbols in cognitive theories that appeal to propositionally modular symbols. Such an argument might suggest that there is no algorithm, expressible in terms of propositionally modular symbols, that captures what is involved in the primitive symbolic operations. Certainly, the induction and pattern matching abilities of Connectionist RSG networks (which might be seen as the primitive symbolic operations of the 'Connectionist CPU') are very powerful. It may be that an important lesson from Connectionist research is that the type of symbol processing we are familiar with involves the wrong type of primitive symbolic operations. Nevertheless, the reliance on relatively sophisticated primitive operations does not require abandoning propositionally modular symbols. I do not see it as necessary for the primitive symbolic operations to be captured by an algorithm expressed in terms of propositionally modular symbols. Thirdly, by advocating this interpretation, I may be contradicting what I believe to be one of RSG's assumptions: that a larger version of their network could instantiate a whole cognitive agent. My interpretation of how to scale up their network to a full cognitive agent likely differs from theirs, as I agree with Fodor and Pylyshyn [1988] that a system based purely on associationist principles, particularly the infinite generability required of a language user, is insufficient. However, there is no reason why any propositional manipulation within a cognitive agent could not be achieved through a 'Connectionist CPU' rather than a von Neumann CPU. Thus, I am positing a sort of hybrid model, but not one where the symbols are instantiated in networks; rather, the central processing is done by networks.\\n\\nI do not believe this interpretation undermines RSG's position, as the central thrust of their argument is that whatever is cognitively interesting about their example cannot be explained in a way compatible with folk psychology. The important consequence of this claim is that whatever degree of cognitive function Connectionism RSG can explain, folk psychology cannot. This consequence must be addressed by supporters of folk psychology if it is to maintain its claim as a theory of cognition in general. Acceptance of the plausibility of Connectionism RSG, under the interpretation given by RSG, in anything other than trivial cognitive functions dealing with propositional information, will challenge folk psychology, necessitating a response.\\n\\nThe response I advocate here recognizes that the processing of folk psychological symbols will not be explained by appealing to more folk psychological symbols. Some form of symbol processing is presupposed by folk psychology, and it is not inconsistent with folk psychology to suggest that symbol processing be done in a Connectionist RSG system. Viewing Connectionism RSG as supplementing folk psychology (by filling in some gaps, so to speak), which is essentially the perspective here, is not to see it as an implementation of folk psychology. However, it is also not to place Connectionism RSG in competition with folk psychology.\",\n"," '# 1. The Semantic View of Theories\\n\\nThe term \"semantic view of theories\" can be somewhat misleading, as it encompasses a range of approaches aimed at clarifying the structure of scientific theories. These approaches share two key assumptions that set them apart from the \"received\" view rooted in logical empiricism, which portrays a theory as a symbolic calculus formalizable in first-order logic and interpretable through correspondence rules. These assumptions are (Mormann 1991):\\n\\n1. Scientific theories are best understood not as linguistic entities (i.e., sets of statements) but in terms of their models.\\n2. The appropriate tool for formally explicating scientific theories is mathematics, rather than first-order logic and metamathematics.\\n\\nProponents of the semantic view differ in their choice of mathematical frameworks. Some prefer a \"state space\" approach (van Fraassen, 1972; Suppe, 1974), others favor set theory (Suppes, 1956, 1967; Sneed, 1971; Stegmüller, 1976), while some advocate for set theory supplemented with category theory (Balzer et al., 1987), and one even incorporates computational resources from cognitive science (Giere, 1988).\\n\\nThe core strategy of a semantic reconstruction is to use the chosen mathematics to define the structure of a theory\\'s models. A theory\\'s empirical assertions are then interpreted as claims that a given empirical system is a model of the theory, meaning it possesses that specific structure. A simple example is classical collision mechanics. If set theory is the chosen mathematical framework, one begins by defining a set-theoretic predicate \"is a model of classical collision mechanics (CCM)\":\\n\\n- \\\\( x \\\\) is a CCM if there exist \\\\( P, T, v, m \\\\) such that:\\n  1. \\\\( P \\\\) is a finite, nonempty set.\\n  2. \\\\( T \\\\) is an ordered pair set \\\\(\\\\langle t_1, t_2 \\\\rangle\\\\).\\n  3. \\\\( v: P \\\\times T \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{R}^3 \\\\).\\n  4. \\\\( m: P \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{R}^+ \\\\).\\n  5. \\\\(\\\\sum_{p \\\\in P} m(p) v(p, t_1) = \\\\sum_{p \\\\in P} m(p) v(p, t_2)\\\\).\\n\\nIn the intended empirical applications of CCM, \\\\( P \\\\) is a set of particles, \\\\( T \\\\) is a set of time instances (\\\\( t_1 \\\\) before, \\\\( t_2 \\\\) after the collision), \\\\( v \\\\) is the velocity relation, \\\\( m \\\\) is the mass relation, and (5) expresses the fundamental law of conservation of momentum. A model of CCM (\\\\(\\\\in M(\\\\text{CCM})\\\\)) is an entity satisfying the predicate \"is a CCM\", and the empirical claim of classical collision mechanics is that the entire set of intended empirical applications \\\\( I \\\\) is a subset of the set of models (\\\\( I \\\\subseteq M(\\\\text{CCM}) \\\\)).\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with the semantic view, this approach may seem confusing. What makes it \"semantic\"? The answer lies in its model-theoretic nature, as a theory is specified directly in terms of its models using appropriate mathematics. However, the term \"model\" can be ambiguous. It sometimes refers to the representation of phenomena, as when a physicist says a set of equations \"is a model\" of a subatomic interaction. Other times, it refers to the thing depicted by the representation, which is the sense used in logic and mathematics.\\n\\nIn the semantic approach, \"model\" is used in this second sense—to refer to the things depicted by the theory. Balzer et al. (1987) clarify this usage:\\n\\n> Instead of saying that certain equations are a model of subatomic or economic phenomena, we propose to say that the subatomic or economic phenomena are models of the theory represented by those equations. Models are, therefore, those \"things\" depicted by a theory. A theory normally has many different models. By being all models of the same theory, they have something in common. Roughly speaking, what they have in common is that they all share the same structure. (pp. 2-3)\\n\\nThe chosen mathematics is then used to characterize the common structure of the models of the theory.\\n\\nIt is important to note that some models of a theory (at least of a successful one) will be empirical phenomena \"in the world,\" while others will be purely mathematical entities. The former constitute the theory\\'s \"empirical applications,\" which are of interest to empirical scientists. Yet, the specification of a theory\\'s model structure is purely formal and does not specify the contents of the base sets (e.g., the characterization of \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) in the CCM example).\\n\\nA significant challenge for proponents of the semantic view has been to articulate its advantages over the received view. Criticisms of the received view by Kuhn, Feyerabend, and others have contributed to some arguments (see Suppe, 1974, pp. 221-230; van Fraassen, 1987; Stegmüller, 1976, Part II). However, independent defenses of the semantic approach exist, with Suppes\\' initial arguments (1956) predating these criticisms.\\n\\nSuppes\\' initial defense of the semantic view was pragmatic. He aimed to axiomatize theories that \"assume more than first-order logic as already available for use in its statement and development.\" For such theories, \"it is neither natural nor simple to formalize [them] in first-order logic\" (p. 248). He acknowledged that one could theoretically axiomatize both the theory and the relevant portions of what was assumed (e.g., set theory) in first-order logic, but this would be \"awkward and unduly laborious\" (p. 248). For theories assuming real numbers and functions, \"[f]ormalization in first-order logic is utterly impractical\" (p. 250). His \"essential methodological purpose\" was to \"demonstrate that the same standards of clarity and precision may be achieved in axiomatizing complicated theories within set theory as are achieved by axiomatizing relatively simple theories directly in first-order logic\" (p. 250).\\n\\nVan Fraassen initially emphasized pragmatic over principled advantages of the semantic view (1970, 1972). More recently, he has become bolder (1980, Chap. 3; 1987). He originally extended Evert Beth\\'s approach into a general philosophy of science. Van Fraassen argued that Beth\\'s state-space account offered a \"much more deep-going analysis of the structure of physical theories\" than the \"very shallow\" reconstructions of the received view (1970, pp. 325-326, 337-338). He claimed that the received view failed to \"present anything like a faithful picture of actual foundational work in physics\" (p. 337). At that time, he believed there were \"natural interrelations\" between syntactic and semantic approaches to the formal study of languages, described by generalized completeness proofs, which \"make implausible any claim of philosophical superiority for either\" (p. 326).\\n\\nReferring back to this claim, van Fraassen has recently stated that he changed his mind about its theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, there are provable limitations of the syntactic approach. When a theory is presented by defining its class of models, \"that class of structures cannot generally be identified with an elementary class of models in any first-order language\" (1987, p. 120). A simple illustration is any theory whose models include the real number continuum, as there is no elementary class of models of any denumerable first-order language each of which includes the real numbers. There are also relationships between models that are \"peculiarly semantic,\" \"clearly very important for the comparison and evaluation of theories,\" and \"not accessible to the syntactic approach,\" such as the relative embeddability of every model of a theory in a model of another syntactically inconsistent with the first (1980, pp. 41-44). Practically, van Fraassen emphasizes \"the enormous distance\" between actual research on the foundations of science and \"syntactically capturable axiomatics\" (1980, pp. 65-67; 1987, pp. 114-118). He concludes that \"while this disparity will not affect philosophical points which hinge only on what is possible \\'in principle\\', it may certainly affect the real possibility of understanding and clarification\" (1987, p. 120).\\n\\nFinally, any survey of recent defenses of the semantic view must include Ronald Giere\\'s (1988) \"cognitivist\" approach to explaining science. By calling his approach \"cognitivist,\" he intends it to be part of a scientific account of scientific activity. He draws resources from recent cognitive science, especially work on human representation and judgment. His advocacy for the semantic view rests on his argument (Chap. 3) that \"recent work in the cognitive sciences provides the inspiration, and some resources, for going further in directions already indicated by Suppes, van Fraassen, and Suppe\" (p. 62). According to Giere, scientific theories consist of two elements: a family of models and various \"theoretical hypotheses\" linking these models to real-world systems. What determines whether a particular model is part of the family comprising the theory is a similarity relationship. (His explanation of this similarity relationship uses recent work from cognitive science; see especially pp. 81-82 and 88-89.) Giere also argues that his version of the semantic view provides a more accurate account of how theories are presented in textbooks than the received view, which is pragmatically important since textbooks remain the primary vehicle of scientific education.',\n"," '# Intertheoretic Reduction in the Semantic View\\n\\nWe\\'ve explored one way proponents of the semantic view defend their alternative account of the structure of scientific theories. Another popular defense involves the explication of important relations between theories, construed semantically, that their formal resources allow. Notably, this includes accounts of intertheoretic reduction, a concept that traces back to Suppes\\' initial work (1956, p. 271) and has been a central concern of the \"structuralist\" school (Stegmüller, 1976, Chap. 9; Balzer et al., 1984; Balzer et al., 1987, Chaps. VI-VII).\\n\\nSuppes\\' initial account of reduction used the notion of isomorphism:\\n\\nTo demonstrate that thermodynamics can be reduced to statistical mechanics, we would need to axiomatize both disciplines by defining appropriate set-theoretical predicates and then show that for any model \\\\( T \\\\) of thermodynamics, we can find a model of statistical mechanics from which we can construct a model isomorphic to \\\\( T \\\\). (1956, p. 271)\\n\\nThe notion of isomorphism here is the familiar one from set theory, although Suppes admits that when the structures are as complex as the models of actual empirical theories, \"it is sometimes difficult to decide exactly what is meant by two isomorphic models\" (1956, p. 262).\\n\\nHowever, even setting aside technical difficulties, the Suppes reduction paradigm faced a significant critique by Schaffner (1967). Schaffner argued that Suppes\\' account is too weak to serve as an adequate analysis of scientific reduction. The basic observation was straightforward: \"different and nonreducible (at least to one another) physical theories can have the same formal structure - e.g., the theory of heat and hydrodynamics - and yet one would not wish to claim that any reduction could be constructed here\" (p. 145). Thus, while isomorphism might be a necessary condition for intertheoretic reduction, it is not sufficient, and the Suppes paradigm is inadequate without additional criteria to rule out these counterexamples.\\n\\nRecent work by the structuralist school can be seen as an attempt to respond to Schaffner. They have proposed criteria stronger than isomorphism to characterize a reduction relation set-theoretically. Following Sneed (1971), structuralists distinguish the possible models \\\\( M_{p}(T) \\\\) of a theory \\\\( T \\\\) from the actual models. Using Stegmüller\\'s helpful phrase, the possible models are those structures about which it \"makes sense\" to ask whether they are actual models. In the CCM example cited above, notice the intuitive difference between axioms (1)-(5) and axiom (6). Axioms (1)-(5) formally characterize the conceptual structure of the models of CCM, while axiom (6) expresses the theory\\'s fundamental empirical law. The possible models of CCM are those structures meeting conditions (1)-(5), while the actual models are those possible models which also meet axiom (6). In general, \\\\( M(T) \\\\subseteq M_{p}(T) \\\\).\\n\\nOne developed structuralist reduction concept (from Balzer et al., 1987, Chap. VI; my presentation below is greatly simplified, as this level of detail will suffice to make the crucial points to follow) has as the domain of the reduction relation \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) a restricted subset \\\\( M_{r}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) of the possible models of reducing theory \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\), and as the range the set of possible models \\\\( M_{p} \\\\) of reduced theory \\\\( T \\\\). \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) is total on \\\\( M_{r}^{\\\\prime} \\\\), into \\\\( M_{p} \\\\), and (typically) many-one. \\\\( M_{r}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) must also have a nonempty intersection with the set of actual models \\\\( M^{\\\\prime} \\\\) of (reducing) \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\).\\n\\nBalzer, Moulines, and Sneed then impose two additional conditions on \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\). To be a genuine reduction relation, the range of \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) must be restricted to the actual models \\\\( M \\\\) of (reduced) \\\\( T \\\\) when \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\)\\'s domain is restricted to the intersection of \\\\( M_{r}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) and \\\\( M^{\\\\prime} \\\\). (Notice that this condition is a set-theoretic analog of (part of) Nagel\\'s (1961) \"definability\" requirement on the reducing theory). Second, when the range of \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) is restricted to confirmed intended applications of (reduced) \\\\( T \\\\) (those possible models of real-world systems already shown to be actual models), \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\)\\'s domain must be restricted to a subset \\\\( I_{0}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) of confirmed intended applications of (reducing) \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\). (Notice that this condition is a set-theoretic analog of Nagel\\'s (1961) \"derivability\" requirement on the reduced from the reducing theory.) This final condition is a very strong empirical constraint on the reduction relation: the reducing theory must contain a subclass of confirmed intended applications related by \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) to all of the confirmed intended applications of the reduced; the reducing theory must at least match the reduced in terms of explanatory power.\\n\\nThis account of reduction has several appealing features. First, it shows how a reduction, Nagelian in spirit, can unproblematically occur between \"incommensurable\" theories, as the account does not require predicate-by-predicate translations or derivability of statements. This feature led Stegmüller (1976, Chap. 16) to present his account as the logical solution to the great \"rationality gap\" in Kuhn\\'s philosophy of science. Second, this account of both theories and theory reduction (in its unsimplified versions) has proven remarkably fruitful in developing detailed reconstructions of important episodes in the history of science, well beyond those developed within the \"received view\" tradition. Third, the account naturally extends to an account of \"approximative\" reduction, another important feature of actual science often overlooked in the received view tradition.\\n\\nOther accounts of reduction have been developed, both within the structuralist program specifically and within the semantic approach more generally. These numerous accounts are not only nonequivalent; some are contradictory. (See Rott, 1987, and Mormann, 1988, for good overviews and comparisons of some of these accounts.) Deciding among these competing accounts is no easy task. Their respective capacities to reconstruct historical cases in an illuminating and fruitful manner is a key evaluative criterion. Similarly, one\\'s larger scientific epistemology will influence the decision. If one\\'s perspective on science is more \"Nagelian\" in spirit, they will likely be attracted to the structuralist account sketched above. Conversely, if one\\'s general perspective is more \"Kuhnian\" (or \"Lakatosian\"), they may be more drawn to an alternative structuralist account of reduction, such as one developed by Dieter Mayr (1976). Using set theory, Mayr characterizes the notion of an \"anomaly\" for a theory and then requires the reducing theory to explain at least one anomaly for the reduced theory (as well as meet various other structural constraints on a reduction relation). Interestingly, this alternative account contradicts the first additional constraint on Balzer, Moulines, and Sneed\\'s account sketched above, the set-theoretic analogue of (part of) Nagel\\'s \"definability\" requirement (see Bickle in preparation, Chap. 6).\\n\\nFor the purposes of this essay, however, I don\\'t need to take a stand on these difficult general methodological issues. This is for two reasons. First, the example I chose to sketch (Balzer, Moulines, and Sneed\\'s account) was chosen merely for illustrative purposes: it both illuminates the sorts of additional constraints that modern proponents of the Suppes paradigm have tried to graft onto that basic approach, and its \"Nagelian spirit\" and relatively straightforward formal treatment render it familiar and accessible to philosophers with little previous knowledge of the structuralist program. Second, and more importantly, there remains a major shortcoming within all developed structuralist accounts that characterize reduction as a \"global\" relation on theories, i.e., on sets of possible models. Namely, the very heart of Schaffner\\'s challenge to the Suppes reduction paradigm goes unanswered. Consider this evaluation of structuralist reduction concepts by C.U. Moulines:\\n\\nThere is at least one further aspect of reduction that is overlooked. This is what I would like to call \"the ontological aspect.\" I wish to argue that, for a complete picture of a reductive relationship between two theories, one has to take into account some sort of relation between the respective domains. Otherwise, when confronted with a particular example of a reductive pair, we would feel that all we have is an ad hoc mathematical relationship between two sets of structures, perhaps by chance having the mathematical properties we require of reduction but not really telling us something about \"the world.\" (1984, p. 55; my emphasis)\\n\\nNot really telling us, that is, whether the reduction obtained in a given case is genuine or artificial and ad hoc. (If Moulines is right, however, the source of this shortcoming lies not in an identification of reduction with isomorphism, as Schaffner diagnoses it, but rather with the \"global\" approach of characterizing the reduction relation directly between sets of (possible) models.)\\n\\nBut Moulines (1984) also proposes a solution to this problem. Consider the internal structure of the possible models of a theory. Any \\\\( x \\\\in M_{p}(T) \\\\) is an ordered \\\\( n+m+p \\\\)-tuple of the form\\n\\n\\\\[ x=\\\\left\\\\langle D_{1}, \\\\ldots, D_{n}, A_{1}, \\\\ldots, A_{m}, r_{1}, \\\\ldots, r_{p}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\]\\n\\nwhere the \\\\( D_{i} \\\\) are the \"real\" or \"empirical\" base sets, the \\\\( A_{i} \\\\) are the \"auxiliary\" base sets (mathematical and other formal spaces), and the \\\\( r_{i} \\\\) are the theory\\'s fundamental relations typified by the base sets. In the CCM example cited above, all possible models contain two empirical base sets \\\\( (P, T) \\\\), one auxiliary base set \\\\( (\\\\Re) \\\\), and two fundamental relations typified over the base sets \\\\( \\\\left(v \\\\in \\\\mathscr{P}\\\\left(P \\\\times T \\\\times \\\\mathfrak{R}^{3}\\\\right)\\\\right. \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\left.m \\\\in \\\\mathscr{P}\\\\left(P \\\\times \\\\mathfrak{R}^{+}\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\).\\n\\nMoulines\\'s strategy is to reconceive the \"global\" reduction relation \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) on \\\\( M_{p}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) and \\\\( M_{p} \\\\) as (partly) composed of \"local\" relations on the base sets comprising the possible models of \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\). He dubs these local relations ontological reductive links (ORLs). They function much like the \"bridge laws\" or \"coordinating definitions\" of the orthodox logical empiricist account; but the underlying semantic view of theories makes their logical status significantly less problematic than their empiricist analogs, especially for \"incommensurable\" reductive pairs (Moulines 1984, p. 58).\\n\\nIntuitively, an ORL is a relation between an empirical base set of the possible models of (reduced) \\\\( T \\\\) and some base set(s) and relation(s) of (reducing) \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\). The global reduction relation \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) is (partly) composed of one ORL for each empirical base set of possible models of \\\\( T \\\\). Each ORL is one of two kinds. Homogeneous ORLs are partial or total identity relations between empirical base sets of \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\): total when the \\\\( D_{i} \\\\) of \\\\( T \\\\) is extensionally identical to some \\\\( D_{j}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) of \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\), partial when the \\\\( D_{i} \\\\) is a proper subset of some \\\\( D_{j}^{\\\\prime} \\\\). Heterogeneous ORLs are more complex, involving several cases. Intuitively, a heterogeneous ORL is a relation between some empirical base set of the possible models of \\\\( T \\\\) and some base set(s) or relation(s) of the possible models of \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\) such that set inclusion does not obtain. The separate cases of heterogeneous ORLs result from the possible combinations of base sets and relations to which a given \\\\( D_{i} \\\\) of \\\\( T \\\\) might be linked by the reduction. (See Moulines, 1984, pp. 62-67, for the formal details.) Finally, note that a global reduction relation \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) can be composed of both homogeneous and heterogeneous ORLs: homogeneous for some of the empirical base sets of \\\\( T \\\\), heterogeneous for others. Such cases, which according to Moulines constitute the norm for actual reductions in science, are dubbed \"mixed reductions.\"\\n\\nORLs solve the Schaffner problem for set-theoretic accounts of theory reduction, as in genuine reductions, the appropriate global relation on theories obtains and is composed of ORLs linking all the empirical base sets of \\\\( T \\\\) with elements of the possible models of \\\\( T^{\\\\prime} \\\\). This is the sense in which \"real\" reductions \"tell us something about the world.\" Artificial and ad hoc cases will lack this second feature. But notice also that ORLs provide a resource for drawing a principled distinction between ontologically retentive and eliminative theory changes. Being homogeneously linked in a reduction indicates clear retention for that domain of elements of \\\\( T \\\\); and to a first approximation, being heterogeneously linked indicates replacement (although see the discussion of the second \"consideration\" in the final section below). These links are not ad hoc creations designed merely to provide a principled ontological retention/replacement distinction; rather, they are introduced as fundamental aspects of a set-theoretic account of a theory reduction relation adequate to capture the explicandum.\\n\\nWhile structuralists have reconstructed eliminativist cases of theory change within their program, this application of ORLs to draw a principled retentive-eliminative theory change distinction is not explicit in the structuralist literature. So in its defense, consider first two of the cases Ramsey et al. (1990) use to illustrate their intuitive distinction between \"ontologically conservative\" and \"ontologically radical\" theory changes. On the conservative (retentive) side, they appeal to the change from Ptolemaic (geocentric) to Copernican (heliocentric) theories of the solar system. While this change revolutionized everything about the motions of the planets, the authors insist that \"it would be something of a joke to suggest that Copernicus and Galileo showed that the planets Ptolemy spoke of do not exist\" (p. 503). A semantical reconstruction of this case along with the application of ORLs urged above shows exactly why. The empirical base set consisting of the planets in the intended application of Ptolemaic astronomy gets linked by the reduction to the empirical base set of planets in Copernican astronomy, as these are the empirical elements that stand in special (but quite different) orbit relations in the respective theories. This ORL is homogeneous, as the former is a subset of the latter.\\n\\nConsider next one of Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s parade cases for eliminativism: phlogiston to oxygen chemistry. This theory change is typically thought to show that phlogiston does not exist. This conclusion is appropriate from the semantic perspective enriched with this application of ORLs, as the relevant ORL is heterogeneous. Possible models of phlogiston chemistry contain two separate base sets of chemical elements: \\\\( D_{1} \\\\), consisting of phlogiston elements, and \\\\( D_{2} \\\\), consisting of the rest. (This separation is not ad hoc, for as Kamlah argues, all and only phlogiston elements have negative atomic weight when the theory is reconstructed within a modern account of chemical reaction. This distinction forces separate treatments of the atomic weight relation typified over the base sets for the two sets of elements.) Oxygen chemistry contains a single empirical base set of chemical elements \\\\( D_{1}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) to which both \\\\( D_{1} \\\\) and \\\\( D_{2} \\\\) get linked via an ORL in the reduction. That \\\\( D_{1} \\\\) gets linked in the reduction to \\\\( D_{1}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) is shown by the fact that the mass density of phlogiston can be obtained from that of oxygen (and vice versa) by a simple linear transformation (see Kamlah, 1984 for the details). The \\\\( D_{2}-D_{1}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) ORL is homogeneous (\\\\( D_{2} \\\\subseteq D_{1}^{\\\\prime} \\\\)), but the \\\\( D_{1}-D_{1}^{\\\\prime} \\\\) ORL is heterogeneous: the set of chemical elements in any empirical application of oxygen chemistry does not contain phlogiston. Set inclusion does not obtain, and so the eliminativist conclusion is warranted in accordance with the ontological lesson urged owing to the nature of the ORL.\\n\\nTo further defend this application of ORLs toward drawing a principled retentive/eliminative theory change distinction (again, modulo the discussion in Section 4 below), consider finally a case Moulines mentions to illustrate heterogeneous ORLs (1984, pp. 61-62). The reduction of Newtonian particle mechanics (NPM) to special relativity theory (SR) is usually regarded as retentive for the particles of NPM (Einstein is not usually thought to have demonstrated the nonexistence of the particles Newtonians spoke of) but eliminative concerning the existence of separate and Absolute Space and Time. This ontological conclusion exactly coheres with the nature of the mixed NPM-SR reduction, given the application of ORLs suggested above. Base sets consisting of particles in empirical applications of NPM get homogeneously linked with base sets of particles in reduction-related possible models of SR; these are the empirical elements that stand in the various (and quite distinct) mass, length, and velocity relations on the respective theories, by which they figure in the (again, quite distinct) laws. On the other hand, the separate base sets of Space points and Time instances of possible models of NPM get linked by heterogeneous ORLs to the single Minkowski space in reduction-related possible models of SR, as set inclusions between these base sets in \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\)-related possible models do not obtain. Once again, scientists\\' ontological intuitions align with the nature of the obtaining ORLs.\\n\\nOne significant virtue of this approach toward explicating theory change is that it allows us to ask separately about the ontological status of all the posits of the old theory. What then can it tell us about the posits of folk psychology vis-a-vis a hypothesized theory change to connectionist cognitive science?',\n"," '\\\\section*{3. Application to the Connectionism-Eliminativism Issue}\\n\\nTo address this question, we first require semantic axiomatizations of the two theories. For folk psychology, the essential features of mental representations to be captured are as follows:\\n\\n1. Mental representations are propositionally interpretable, but this does not necessarily mean that the representations themselves \"contain\" propositions or sentences. There is no required commitment to \"sentences in the head\" or a language of thought.\\n2. Mental representations are causally effective, leading to actions or other mental representations.\\n3. These causal relations are isomorphic to various logical relations (such as equivalence, entailment, consistency, and possibly relevance) that hold between the propositional interpretations of the representations.\\n\\nSet-theoretically axiomatized, folk psychology\\'s account of mental representation is:\\n\\n$x$ is a possible model of folk psychology ($x \\\\in M_{p}(FP)$) if and only if $x = \\\\langle S, MR, \\\\text{Act}, \\\\text{Prop}, \\\\text{Intrp}, C \\\\rangle$.\\n\\n3. $MR$ is a finite, nonempty set.\\n4. Act is a finite, possibly empty set.\\n5. Intrp: $S \\\\times MR \\\\cup S \\\\times \\\\text{Act} \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Prop}$.\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nC: \\\\mathscr{P}(S \\\\times MR) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathscr{P}(S \\\\times MR \\\\cup S \\\\times \\\\text{Act}) \\\\tag{6}\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nIn intended applications of $FP$, $S$ is the subject, $MR$ is a set of mental representations, Act is a set of actions, Prop is a set of propositions, Intrp is the interpretation relation for a subject\\'s mental representations and actions, and $C$ is the causation relation from a subject\\'s mental representations to other representations or actions. $S$, $MR$, and Act are the empirical base sets of possible models of $FP$, Prop is an auxiliary base set, and Intrp and $C$ are the fundamental theoretical relations typified over the base sets. Actual models of $FP$ will additionally require $C$ to mimic or reflect various logical relations in accordance with some appropriate propositional logic holding for $F(C)$. For example, the following might constitute the fundamental law for folk psychology:\\n\\nFor all $m_{1}, \\\\ldots, m_{n} \\\\in MR, a \\\\in MR \\\\cup \\\\text{Act}, s \\\\in S$, if $C\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle s, m_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\ldots,\\\\left\\\\langle s, m_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right)=\\\\langle s, a\\\\rangle$, then $\\\\operatorname{Intrp}\\\\left\\\\langle s, m_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\& \\\\ldots \\\\& \\\\operatorname{Intrp}\\\\left\\\\langle s, m_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle$ stands in $L$ to $\\\\operatorname{Intrp}\\\\langle s, a\\\\rangle$ where $L$ is some logical relation sanctioned by the propositional logic appropriate for the particular application in question.\\n\\nTo illustrate this axiomatization, consider a simple folk psychological explanation: Why is Alfred ringing Alonzo\\'s doorbell? Because he desires to be in Alonzo\\'s presence, believes that ringing the doorbell will bring him into Alonzo\\'s presence, and believes that his action will ring the doorbell. This episode is a possible model for $FP$: $S = \\\\{\\\\text{Alfred}\\\\}$; $MR = \\\\{\\\\text{desires, believes}_1, \\\\text{believes}_2\\\\}$; Act = \\\\{is bringing about this movement\\\\}; Prop = \\\\{that Alfred comes to be in Alonzo\\'s presence, that if Alfred rings Alonzo\\'s doorbell, then he comes to be in Alonzo\\'s presence, that (by this movement) Alfred rings Alonzo\\'s doorbell\\\\}; Intrp $\\\\langle$Alfred, desires$\\\\rangle$ = that Alfred comes to be in Alonzo\\'s presence, Intrp $\\\\langle$Alfred, believes$_1\\\\rangle$ = that if Alfred rings Alonzo\\'s doorbell, then he comes to be in Alonzo\\'s presence, Intrp $\\\\langle$Alfred, believes$_2\\\\rangle$ = that (by this movement) Alfred rings Alonzo\\'s doorbell; and $C\\\\{\\\\langle$Alfred, believes$_1\\\\rangle, \\\\langle$Alfred, believes$_2\\\\rangle\\\\} = \\\\langle$Alfred, is bringing about this movement$\\\\rangle$ in fulfillment of $\\\\langle$Alfred, desires$\\\\rangle$. This possible model is also an actual model of $FP$ because Intrp $\\\\langle$Alfred, believes$_1\\\\rangle$ \\\\& Intrp $\\\\langle$Alfred, believes$_2\\\\rangle$ stands in the appropriate logical relation (in this case, implication) to Intrp (Alfred, is bringing about this movement) in fulfillment of Intrp $\\\\langle$Alfred, desires$\\\\rangle$.\\n\\nNext, for a set-theoretic axiomatization of (distributed) connectionist systems, the minimal features to be captured are:\\n\\nDistributed representational connectionist systems consist of:\\n\\ni. A set of processing units.\\nii. A state of activation.\\niii. For each unit, an output function.\\niv. A pattern of connectivity among the units.\\nv. An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current activation state of that unit to produce a new level of activation for that unit.\\n(See, e.g., Rumelhart et al. 1986, pp. 46-54).\\n\\nRepresentations within connectionist models are usually characterized in one of two ways: as patterns of activation values (vectors of nonnegative real numbers representing the activation level produced in some or all of the nodes) or as patterns of connection weight values that regulate activation values in all but the input nodes of the network.\\n\\nA set-theoretic axiomatization of the connectionist account of representations is:\\n\\n$x$ is a possible model of distributed representational connectionist systems ($x \\\\in M_{p}(\\\\text{DRCS})$) if and only if:\\n\\n1. $x = \\\\langle N, \\\\text{Act}, T, \\\\mathfrak{R}, AV, O, I, CW, C \\\\rangle$.\\n2. $N$ is a finite, nonempty, nonsingleton, well-ordered set.\\n3. Act is a finite, possibly empty set.\\n4. $T$ is a finite, nonempty, nonsingleton, well-ordered set.\\n5. $AV: N \\\\times T \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{R}^{+}$.\\n6. $O: N \\\\rightarrow \\\\Re$ and $\\\\forall n \\\\in N(O(n) = A(AV(n)))$.\\n7. $I: N \\\\rightarrow \\\\Re$.\\n8. $CW: N \\\\times N \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{R}$ and $\\\\forall n \\\\in N(CW(n, n) = 0)$.\\n9. $C: AV^{*} \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Act}$ where $AV^{*} \\\\subseteq AV$.\\n\\nIn empirical applications of DRCS, $N$ is a set of processing units or nodes, Act is a set of actions, $T$ is a set of time instances, $AV$ is the activation value relation, $O$ is the output relation (determined by some mathematical function $A$ on each unit\\'s activation value), $I$ is the input to units (if any) from outside the system, $CW$ is the connection weight relation (with the added restriction that no unit is actively connected with itself), and $C$ is the causation relation from a subset of activation values (typically a proper subset, being limited to those of the output layer of units) onto actions. Actual models of DRCS must also meet the following condition on $AV$:\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n& \\\\forall n_{1}, n_{2} \\\\in N\\\\left\\\\{AV\\\\left(n_{1}, t\\\\right) = F\\\\left(CW\\\\left(n_{2}, n_{1}\\\\right) O\\\\left(n_{2}\\\\right) \\\\times I\\\\left(n_{1}\\\\right) \\\\times AV\\\\left(n_{1}, t-1\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\} \\\\tag{10}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nInformally, (10) states that the activation value of each unit $n$ at time $t$ is the result of some arithmetical function $F$ (typically a differentiable quasi-linear function) on connection weights multiplied by output values of all units actively connected with $n$, inputs to $n$ from outside of the network (if any), and the activation value of $n$ at the time instant prior to $t$.\\n\\nWith these two axiomatizations before us, I now offer the following conjecture:\\n\\n$C$: There is no barrier in principle to the claim that $FP$ will someday stand in relation $\\\\rho$ to DRCS.\\n\\nThat $FP$ will be reduced in the sense of $\\\\rho$ to DRCS is an empirical hypothesis, entirely dependent upon the ultimate explanatory power of connectionist cognitive science. Given the features of $\\\\rho$ sketched above, conjecture $C$ amounts to the claim that DRCS might eventually provide a nonempty subclass $I_{0}^{\\\\prime}$ of confirmed empirical applications such that the entire class $I$ of confirmed empirical applications of $FP$ is included in the range of $\\\\rho$ when its domain is restricted to this $I_{0}^{\\\\prime}$. Whether this condition actually gets met depends on whether DRCS turns out to match $FP$ in explanatory power. Conjecture $C$ simply says that there is no conceptual barrier to this outcome at present.\\n\\nIt should be noted in further defense of $C$ that many connectionists are bolder in their conjectures about the explanatory potential of connectionism as a general theory of cognition. Paul Churchland (1989) claims, in reference to connectionist AI, that \"a new kinematics for cognitive activity is already here\" (p. xvi, my emphases). Paul Smolensky (1988) goes so far as to speculate that, beyond it being \"very likely\" that connectionism will surpass the contributions toward modeling human cognitive performance offered by \"traditional symbolic models,\" connectionist models \"may possibly even challenge the strong construal of Church\\'s Thesis that the class of well-defined computations is exhausted by those of Turing machines\" (p. 3). Set against these sorts of conjectures, $C$ is a relatively modest prediction about connectionism\\'s potential.\\n\\nIf $C$ is plausible, we can next speculate about the ORLs that will link empirical base sets of $FP$ to elements of the reduction ($\\\\rho$)-related possible models of DRCS. First, the set $S$ (the subject set) of any possible model of $FP$ will be linked to the entire set $N$ (the processing nodes) in $\\\\rho$-related possible models of DRCS, since these are the respective seats of cognitive activity on the two theories. Set inclusion will not obtain here ($S \\\\subseteq \\\\subseteq N$); so this ORL is heterogeneous and, in keeping with the lesson of the previous section, the hypothesized theory change will be eliminative for the folk psychological subject. Second, the set $MR$ will be linked by an ORL to either $AV$ (typically a proper subset of $AV$) or to $CW$ in the $\\\\rho$-related possible models of DRCS, since the latter constitute the two possible accounts of representation in connectionist systems. But again, set inclusion will not obtain here, since $MR$ is a set of unstructured elements while both $AV$ and $CW$ are sets of ordered pairs. This ORL is heterogeneous, and so the hypothesized theory change is eliminative for the mental representations of folk psychology. Finally, the set Act of $FP$ will be linked via an ORL to the set Act in the $\\\\rho$-related possible models of $FP$ and DRCS, since these constitute the principal causal outcomes of both theories. This ORL will often be homogeneous, so the conjectured theory change will often be retentive for the actions of folk psychology. Should connectionists succeed in their scientific quest, they will not thereby show that the actions explained by folk psychology do not exist.',\n"," '\\\\section*{4. TWO FINAL CONSIDERATIONS}\\n\\nI conclude this investigation by addressing two additional concerns. Firstly, it is noteworthy that Stephen Stich, a key figure in establishing the connectionism-eliminativism alliance, has recently rejected even the \"judgment call\" version of the position (Stich, 1991, 1992). According to Stich, the core thesis of eliminativism is that the terms of the replaced theory fail to refer following a theory change. Therefore, to distinguish between retentive and eliminative theory changes, Stich now asserts that \"the real issue here is the question of what determines the reference of the terms used in a theory\" (1992, p. 255). From this standpoint, he critiques eliminativism on two fronts: it lacks determinate truth conditions and is ontologically uninteresting. On the first front, if indeterminate cases are the norm—instances of theory change where most people have no clear intuitions about whether the terms of the replaced theory still refer—then eliminativism lacks determinate truth conditions. Stich argues that this is evident when imagining a theory undergoing a series of significant revisions due to new empirical discoveries (1991, p. 240). After a short period, most participants in this thought experiment report no clear intuitions about whether the terms of the original theory still refer, and this uncertainty persists until extremely large-scale revisions are considered. In other words, the size of the grey area between clear affirmative and negative responses to the question of reference of the old theory\\'s terms indicates that our intuitions about this aspect of theory change are highly indeterminate. This is precisely what we would expect if our commonsense theory of reference is indeed indeterminate here. If this is correct, then questions like \"Does \\'believes that $p$\\' refer to anything at all?\" will have no answer (1991, p. 241). The eliminativist\\'s central thesis, however, is that the correct answer to such questions is no. Ironically, then, \"if the eliminativist is right about the shortcomings of folk psychology, then the central thesis of eliminativism has no determinate truth conditions\" (1991, p. 241).\\n\\nSecondly, Stich now argues that any attempt to distinguish retentive from eliminative theory changes is ontologically uninteresting. This argument also begins with the claim that questions of reference across theory changes are the only grounds for such a distinction. However, in his latest account of reference (Stich, 1989, Chap. 5), a theory of reference is merely one of a potentially infinite number of mappings from brain states onto states of affairs in the world. So why believe that the particular mapping that aligns with commonsense intuitions about reference tells us anything about what exists? Why is that single mapping privileged in any ontologically significant sense? Consequently, why would any further distinction that relies essentially on intuitions about reference, like a retentive-eliminative theory change distinction, be of any ontological interest?\\n\\nThese arguments are controversial. However, from the account of retentive versus eliminative theory changes developed in this essay, their fundamental flaw traces back to the claim on which they are based: that intuitions about the reference of terms following theory change are the only basis for a principled distinction between retentive and replacement theory changes. By replacing the statement view of theories with a semantic account, the temptation to accept this assumption disappears. Using the resources outlined above, a principled distinction between retentive and replacement theory changes can be constructed entirely upon set inclusions between the base sets and relations constituting the two theories. While Stich might be correct about \"orthodox\" eliminativism—its proponents might tacitly assume the correctness and ontological significance of a \"descriptive\" theory of reference and build their case for eliminativism on this mistaken assumption—one important consequence of this essay is that they certainly don\\'t have to do so. In fact, a better foundation for eliminativism is available.\\n\\nFinally, an important caveat concerning these new eliminativist arguments must be noted. So far, I\\'ve treated every occurrence of a heterogeneous ORL as evidence for an eliminative ontological conclusion. Intuitively, this seems justified for entities like phlogiston and Absolute Space and Time. However, some posits of less \"radically false\" replaced theories will receive identical formal treatment (linkage to base sets or relations of the possible models of the replacing theory via heterogeneous ORLs) and will seemingly also face the eliminativist fate. Two good examples are Mendelian genes (vis-a-vis molecular genetics) and the macroscopic bodies of equilibrium thermodynamics (vis-a-vis the kinetic/corpuscular account). My intuitions, however, resist treating these posits exactly on an ontological par with phlogiston and Absolute Space and Time. These were not so much replaced as revised, supplemented, enriched, and elaborated upon by the theory change. The resources developed in this essay, however, do not distinguish revisionary from eliminativist theory changes.\\n\\nMoulines has a nice way of phrasing what occurs in these revisionary cases: \"The amorphous basic entities of the reduced theory become structured through reduction\" (1984, p. 67; my emphasis). This type of theory change implies significant conceptual change but not wholesale elimination of the posits of the reduced theory.\\n\\nThe fact that the resources developed here do not permit a principled distinction between revisionistic and eliminative theory change is a genuine shortcoming, as the real ontological question about connectionism is whether it is revisionistic or eliminative for the propositional attitudes. My own sympathies lie with the revisionist prediction; the \"structuring\" metaphor seems absolutely appropriate for describing the implications for propositional attitudes from much of recent cognitive neuroscience (Bickle, 1992). An additional resource developed within the structuralist program, the concept of approximative reduction (Balzer et al., 1987, Chap. 7), is suggestive for developing this additional distinction. However, at this stage of the inquiry, formal methods might not be the best strategy for distinguishing ontological revisions from eliminations. This further distinction, already within a \"principled\" ontological replacement class, might be more \"pragmatic\" than \"principled.\" The issues surrounding revisionism are complex and require more sustained treatment than I can provide here.',\n"," '\\\\section*{II. The Model}\\n\\nForster and Saidel have accurately captured the central theme of our original essay. In that essay, we argued that: (1) folk psychology is committed to propositional modularity, meaning that beliefs and desires are semantically evaluable, functionally discrete states that play a causal role in inference and behavior; and (2) certain types of connectionist models—specifically those that encode information in a widely distributed manner—do not involve states or structures with these properties. Therefore, if such models are proven correct, belief-desire accounts of mental processes would be flawed. In response, Forster and Saidel have developed an innovative network that they claim incorporates states with both distributed encoding and the necessary propositional modularity. Consequently, they argue that our original assertion about these models must be incorrect.\\n\\nTo address these claims, I propose two reasons why I disagree with their conclusion that our position is mistaken. The first reason pertains to their assertions about this specific model. Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the model is, in some respects, distributed and, in others, causally modular. However, the causally modular aspects are not truly distributed, and the distributed aspects are not genuinely modular. The second reason involves my skepticism regarding the generalizability of their claims about this model to other types of distributed models. I suggest that certain features of their network make it somewhat atypical and potentially disqualify it as a genuinely distributed network.',\n"," '\\\\section*{II.a. The Short-Term Beliefs}\\n\\nIs it true that this network possesses distributed representations that are also functionally discrete? To address this question, we must examine the structures and states purported to be representations. According to Forster and Saidel, the network has two possible short-term beliefs and two enduring beliefs that interact during different cognitive episodes. Let\\'s begin with the short-term beliefs. Unfortunately, it is unclear which structures or states Forster and Saidel consider as the relevant encodings of these transient beliefs. However, a natural interpretation would be to consider the activation value of input unit $x_{1}$ as representing the steepness of the first slope, and the activation of input unit $x_{2}$ as representing the steepness of the second slope. This interpretation seems plausible because the activation of these two units directly corresponds to the steepness of the two slopes. However, notice that under this interpretation, the short-term beliefs about the angles of the slopes are given a completely localist encoding, as distinct units represent distinct, individual propositions. Consequently, any functional discreteness or causal modularity these beliefs possess is irrelevant to our argument, as we are concerned with non-localist encodings. We have never denied that non-distributed, localist representations can be functionally discrete. Naturally, if specific structures are used to encode specific beliefs, there will be no issue in determining whether the belief was present or causally implicated while other such structures were inactive.\\n\\nThe same point applies if we include the activation of the hidden units in our encoding, as Forster and Saidel clearly wish to do (p. 441). While it is unclear how the semantic evaluation of these units is supposed to proceed, once you fix their representational content so that the particular activation level of a given unit—or, if you prefer, a given set of units—corresponds with a particular short-term belief, it becomes relatively straightforward to trace the causal role of these structures or states in any given run of the system. However, this is because these are localist encodings [1], not because our argument is unsound. On the other hand, one could deny that there is any straightforward semantic evaluation of particular states or structures of the system, as I am inclined to think about the hidden units and their activation levels in this model. But then, of course, it becomes difficult to see what could motivate calling these states and structures \\'beliefs.\\'\\n\\nA puzzling feature of Forster and Saidel\\'s discussion of short-term beliefs is that the model actually involves structures that are causally discrete in a way that, oddly enough, Forster and Saidel seem to want to deny. For instance, they insist that in certain weight configurations (where $\\\\alpha_{1}=\\\\beta_{1}=\\\\alpha_{2}=-\\\\beta_{2}$ and $\\\\gamma_{1}=\\\\gamma_{2}$), the activation of $y_{1}$ \\'will not depend on $x_{2}$ even though $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ depend on both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ and $y_{1}$ depends on $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$\\' (p. 441). But this seems false. Consider Fig. 1, where an example of the weight configuration ratio specified by Forster and Saidel is implemented. If we assume that the hidden units behave as they do in standard connectionist models, where they are either on to some degree or off (but do not take a negative activation value), then it seems quite clear that $y_{2}$ can indeed depend upon the activation of $x_{2}$. If $x_{2}$ becomes active while $x_{1}$ remains off, then $x_{2}$ will activate $y_{1}$ via the $\\\\beta_{1} \\\\rightarrow z_{1} \\\\rightarrow \\\\gamma_{1}$ pathway (though $z_{2}$ will remain inert). Why deny the relevance of $x_{2}$ to $y_{1}$?\\n\\nForster and Saidel\\'s reasoning seems to be that the only way $x_{2}$ can affect $y_{1}$ is either via the $\\\\beta_{1} / \\\\gamma_{1}$ channel or via the $\\\\beta_{2} / \\\\gamma_{2}$ channel. Moreover, they feel that the pathway of $\\\\beta_{2}$ and $\\\\gamma_{2}$ will cancel out the effects of pathway $\\\\beta_{1}$ and $\\\\gamma_{1}$. For example, they state that \"the condition that $y_{1}$ does not depend on information about the [second] slope is: $\\\\beta_{1} \\\\gamma_{1}+\\\\beta_{2} \\\\gamma_{2}=0\" (p. 441). But why interpret the model this way? Firstly, it makes the role of the hidden units extremely problematic. If the overall output of the system is simply a matter of summing the products of the second layer connections with the interlinked first layer connections, as suggested here, then it is difficult to see what exactly the hidden units are doing. Secondly, consider a scenario where both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are fully activated. In this situation, it seems perfectly natural to say that it is $\\\\alpha_{2}$ and $\\\\beta_{2}$ that cancel each other out, since they both terminate in the same unit. That is, instead of supposing that the negative weight of $\\\\beta_{2}$ neutralizes the $\\\\beta_{1} / \\\\gamma_{1}$ pathway, it seems more reasonable to interpret it as neutralizing the effect of $x_{1}$ on hidden unit $z_{2}$—thereby leaving the hidden unit unactivated but allowing $x_{2}$ to contribute to $y_{1}$ via the $\\\\beta_{1} / \\\\gamma_{1}$ link. If the $\\\\alpha_{1}$ connection should break down, why suppose it is the $\\\\alpha_{2} / \\\\gamma_{2}$ pathway that is activating $y_{1}$ instead of the $\\\\beta_{1} / \\\\gamma_{1}$ pathway? As far as I can see, there is no reason to interpret the causal channels of this network in the way suggested by Forster and Saidel.\\n\\nBut even if their interpretation of the causal pathways were correct—and I confess that I do not have a firm grasp of the \\'wiggle\\' theory of causation—the crucial point regarding short-term beliefs remains. These cases do not challenge our original claim because they all involve non-distributed representations. This point also applies to Forster and Saidel\\'s discussion of overdetermination in their elaborated robot example. In all these cases of causal modularity—where it is possible to designate certain structures or states as specific representations—our claim remains unaffected because our argument was concerned only with distributed representations.',\n"," '**II.b. The Long-Term Beliefs**\\n\\nWhat about the two enduring beliefs in Forster and Saidel\\'s innovative network? This is where things get intriguing, as the causal modularity of these long-term beliefs was the main focus of our original paper. If Forster and Saidel can demonstrate that there are semantically evaluable states that are functionally distinct in the way folk psychology suggests beliefs are, yet encoded in a distributed manner, they would indeed pose a significant challenge to our argument. According to Forster and Saidel, the first enduring belief encoded is \"the object on the first slope will slide off if, and only if, it is steeper than 45°\" (p. 442), and the second is \"the object on the second slope will slide off if, and only if, it is steeper than 45°\" (p. 442). What justifies assigning these beliefs to the internal structures of the model? Forster and Saidel assert, \"... the proposition is successfully represented just in case output is connected to input so that y₁=1 if and only if A, at least approximately.\" In other words, the network is interpreted as having enduring beliefs about objects rolling off slopes based on their behavior under certain conditions.\\n\\nI have strong reservations about preserving folk psychology through these semantic evaluations. The main concern is that these content assignments rely on a behaviorist criterion of belief ascription. Given behaviorism\\'s troubled history and its well-documented clash with common sense, it seems doubtful that this strategy would succeed. For instance, it seems plausible that an important role for beliefs in folk psychology is to explain behavior. However, if a necessary and sufficient condition for having a belief is merely a particular behavior in certain conditions, then the explanatory power of the belief regarding that behavior becomes problematic. Additionally, given the content of the beliefs, it\\'s unclear how the model could have false beliefs under this criterion of ascription.\\n\\nFor the sake of argument, I am willing to accept these belief ascriptions and move on to the question of distributed but functionally discrete encodings. Does the network possess these? To answer this, we must examine the structures and states used for the encodings, as we did for the short-term beliefs. What structures encode the first belief, that the object will slide off the first slope if and only if it is steeper than 45°? According to Forster and Saidel, two conditions relevant to this belief involve two subnetworks (x₂ → y₁) and (x₁ → y₁). By combining these two subnetworks, we obtain all the relevant structures for encoding the first enduring belief, as shown in Fig. 2. We can do the same for the second enduring belief, combining the relevant subnetworks to illustrate the structures used to encode this belief, as seen in Fig. 3. Excluding the input and output units, Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the parts of the network used to encode the first and second enduring beliefs, respectively. These structures must be functionally discrete for their argument to hold.\\n\\nGiven that the representations are structured this way, it\\'s clear that the encodings of the long-term beliefs do not entirely overlap—the connections γ₁ and γ₂ help encode the first belief but not the second, while connections δ₁ and δ₂ help encode the second but not the first. Consequently, regarding these \\'second layer\\' connections, the encodings are entirely non-distributed and localist. Moreover, changes in these connections would affect one condition without influencing the other, thus entailing a form of causal modularity. However, this modularity does not undermine our argument because, as noted, these are completely localist encodings. So, which parts of the network employ truly distributed encodings? Clearly, the parts that represent both beliefs; namely, the connections α₁ and α₂, β₁ and β₂, and the two hidden nodes and biases. These structures must possess functional discreteness (in a way that assigns different causal roles to the two beliefs) for our argument to be challenged. Is this possible? It seems clear that it would be impossible to change one condition without also changing the other. For example, if we alter condition 2\\' such that α₁ and α₂ both take very strong negative values (while δ₁ and δ₂ remain positive), this modification would profoundly affect the first condition encoding the first belief. Thus, regarding the parts of the network that truly involve distributed representations, changing one encoding condition does indeed influence the causal role of the other. Consequently, Forster and Saidel\\'s model fails to undermine our claim that distributed representations are not functionally discrete.\\n\\nAnother way to see this point is to consider how Forster and Saidel specify the conditions for functional discreteness. According to them, the test for functional discreteness is roughly: does changing the structures (or conditions) relevant to encoding one belief alter the effects of structures relevant to encoding the other belief when the second set of structures (or conditions) are held constant? If the answer is \\'no\\', then they are functionally discrete; if \\'yes\\', they are not.\\n\\nAs it stands, this criterion for functional discreteness seems inadequate, as it cannot accommodate many intuitive cases of causal interdependency. For example, it cannot handle cases where interdependency arises because it is impossible to change structures responsible for one representation without simultaneously changing the structures responsible for the other representation (i.e., cases where it is impossible to alter one set of structures and hold the other set constant). A better test for functional discreteness would be: does changing one encoding have any influence at all on the causal role of the other? If we take this as our test of causal modularity, it becomes clear that regarding those structures encoding the long-term beliefs in a truly distributed manner—i.e., the connection weights in the first layer of the model, α₁ and α₂ and β₁ and β₂—there is no causal modularity. The only way that conditions (1\\') and (1\\'\\') can be adjusted without influencing conditions (2\\') and (2\\'\\') is by modifying those structures (the second-layer connection weights) that encode the beliefs in a non-distributed fashion. Consequently, the parts of the model that encode truly distributed representations are not functionally discrete, and the parts of the model that are functionally discrete do not encode truly distributed representations.',\n"," '\\\\section*{II.c. The Generality of the Model}\\n\\nAnother reason I am skeptical about the challenge this model poses to our argument is that it does not seem to represent the class of connectionist networks our original argument addressed. As Forster and Saidel note, my concern is that for this simple task, the model includes an atypical number of unnecessary connections and nodes. In distributed networks trained using back-propagation, it is generally the case that the same units and connection weights are compelled to encode several representations. However, because the task is so simple here, this is not necessary. For instance, a model as simple as the one illustrated in Fig. 4 would suffice for the prediction task. Forster and Saidel counter this by stating that it is common and desirable for networks to have extra connections and nodes:\\n\\n\"Some degree of redundancy of weights and hidden units in connectionist models of human cognition is meant to be part of what makes them biologically plausible—allowing for the graceful degradation of cognitive capacities and relative insensitivity to brain damage (clearly, distributiveness alone does not guarantee these properties).\" (p. 447)\\n\\nBut is this correct? While it is true that graceful degradation is a beneficial feature of connectionist models, it does not arise in distributed models by employing more connections and nodes than are needed for a localist solution. Indeed, this contradicts the entire spirit of efficient distributed and conjunctive encoding. Typically, the goal is to train a network that possesses far fewer nodes and connections than would be required for localist information storage. Distributed networks of this kind use what can be called superpositional encodings (Van Gelder, 1991) because there are not enough connections and nodes for a localist solution, and the same structures must perform multiple functions. In describing connectionist memory, this is what McClelland and Rumelhart have in mind when they state that each memory trace is distributed over many different connections, and each connection participates in many different memory traces. The traces of different mental states are therefore superimposed in the same set of weights (1986).\\n\\nIt is this property of connectionism that gives rise to graceful degradation. However, it is also this property that makes causal modularity of distributed representations impossible. Consequently, since Forster and Saidel\\'s network does not require superpositional encodings for the prediction task, there is still reason to doubt that their conclusions generalize to the more conventional forms of distributed networks.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{III. Projectibility}\\n\\nIn contrast to their other criticisms, I find myself in agreement with the general sentiment of Forster and Saidel's critique regarding our discussion on projectibility, allowing me to be concise. Although I cannot speak for my co-authors, I now recognize (thanks to Forster and Saidel's insightful discussion) that it was an error to associate questions about the ontological status of a property with questions about its projectibility. There are numerous non-projectible predicates, such as 'grue', which denote instantiated properties, and many perfectly projectible predicates, such as 'winged horse', that do not refer to anything. Furthermore, merely demonstrating that something is 'chaotically disjunctive' from a particular perspective is insufficient to dismiss its existence. Consider how disjunctive the concept of 'chair' appears from the standpoint of atomic physics; yet, few would deny the existence of chairs. Therefore, the reason certain connectionist models challenge the predicates of folk psychology is not due to each network denoting something different. They challenge the predicates because there is nothing within any of the networks that can reasonably be considered the predicate's extension. What we should have stated is not that a family of such networks provides a chaotically disjunctive instantiation of folk psychology posits; rather, the issue is that in such networks, no candidates for the disjuncts can be found at any level of analysis. Consequently, these models are incompatible with the posits of folk psychology and would imply eliminativism if proven correct.\",\n"," '### The Serial-Digital Computer as a Model for the Brain\\n\\nSkinner\\'s reluctance to address the issue of novel sentence formation was not the only reason linguists moved away from behaviorism. Equally significant was his unwillingness to explore the brain mechanisms involved in language processing. This stance distanced him from the burgeoning fields of cognitive science and artificial intelligence, which were gaining momentum through the adoption of the serial-digital (S-D) computer as a model for understanding how the brain controls behavior.\\n\\nIn contrast, Chomsky and his followers embraced these new ideas. While there is no direct evidence that Chomsky was initially influenced by the S-D computer model when developing his theories, the parallels between the two are striking. The S-D computer operates by manipulating symbols according to a set of predefined rules or instructions, known as a program, which is stored in its memory and accessed as needed. Although some programs can adapt based on experiences of success and failure, they are generally fixed at the time of creation and externally loaded into the machine. Additionally, every digital computer requires an operating program that is hardwired from its inception. This concept closely mirrors Chomsky\\'s idea of novel sentences being generated by an innate set of syntactic rules, or \"deep structure.\"',\n"," '\\\\section*{Fodor and the Language of Thought Hypothesis}\\n\\nThe parallel between Chomskyan theory and the serial-digital (S-D) computer model has its limitations, prompting Jerry Fodor, initially a devoted follower of Chomsky, to diverge and explore the computer analogy to its logical end. In \"The Language of Thought\" (1975), Fodor argues that a computer program\\'s set of rules or instructions must be expressed in a language or code—a system of symbols or \"words\" organized into strings or \"sentences\" according to specific syntactic rules. An S-D computer processes sentences written in a \"programming language\" either because it has been programmed to do so or, in the case of \"machine language\" or \"machine code,\" because the ability to respond to digital pulse sequences has been hardwired into the device during its construction. Fodor\\'s \"language of thought\" is akin to the brain\\'s machine language.\\n\\nThe idea that the brain, as a device, constructs and interprets novel sentences in natural language through an innate pre-programmed set of rules in the language of thought seems initially similar to Chomsky\\'s hypothesis. Chomsky suggests that sentence construction and interpretation are generated by syntactic and semantic rules with an innately pre-programmed \"deep structure.\"\\n\\nAs a result, linguists could integrate this new concept without altering the \"surface structure\" of the theory concerning the rule-governed generation of well-formed sentences in natural language.\\n\\nHowever, at a deeper level, the language-of-thought hypothesis significantly alters our understanding of language. If the brain is indeed an S-D computer with its own hardwired machine language in the form of the language of thought, then language is not merely a tool evolved by humans for communication. Instead, language is an intrinsic component of the thought (computation) process that operates not only in the human brain but potentially in the brains of most, if not all, multicellular, free-moving organisms.',\n"," '# The Parallel Distributed Processor\\n\\nFor much of the past two decades, it has been argued, notably by Fodor (1975; 1987), that there was no viable alternative to the serial-digital (S-D) computer as a model for brain function. This perspective has shifted with the emergence—or more accurately, the resurgence—of the neural network or parallel distributed processor (Rumelhart, McClelland, and the PDP Research Group, 1986) as a credible model for brain activity, presenting a formidable challenge to the S-D computer.\\n\\nA parallel distributed processor consists of neuron-like semiconductor units, commonly referred to as \"nodes,\" interconnected in a network similar to the neuronal connections in the \"grey matter\" of the central nervous system. Like the S-D computer, a parallel distributed processor processes information to generate an output based on the current input. However, unlike the S-D device, where the output is computed through a sequence of steps dictated by a predetermined set of symbolically formulated instructions, the output in a parallel distributed processor is shaped by how the input pattern is transformed as it traverses a network of synaptically connected nodes. This transformation is influenced by the network\\'s size and complexity and the \"weights\" of the synaptic connections between nodes. The weight of a synaptic connection is a dispositional property that determines whether the firing of the input-side node excites or inhibits the firing of the output-side node.\\n\\nBy assigning specific weights to the synaptic connections within the network, the processor can be predisposed to respond in particular ways to specific types of inputs. Unlike the S-D computer, whose responses are governed by rules and instructions encoded in machine language, these predispositions in a parallel distributed processor can be modified through changes in synaptic weights resulting from learning experiences.',\n"," '# Eliminative Connectionism\\n\\nThe process by which weights are adjusted—either increased or decreased—each time a specific connection is activated or inhibited, endows neural networks with their unique ability to function as pattern discrimination learning devices. For this property to manifest, the changes must adhere to certain consistent patterns or \"rules.\" According to McClelland and Rumelhart (1988), two primary rules facilitate learning in networks: the Hebbian or correlational learning rule and the error-correcting or \"delta\" learning rule (McClelland and Rumelhart, 1988, p. 83).\\n\\nThese learning rules differ significantly from those that govern the operation of traditional sequential-digital (S-D) computers. In S-D computers, rules dictate specific actions at each computational step, requiring decisions between two alternatives. In contrast, the learning rules of a parallel distributed processor describe a uniform change in the weights of all synaptic connections within a network, resulting from their prior activation. This distinction is often blurred because most parallel distributed processors in use today are S-D computers programmed to function as parallel distributed processors. In such cases, the learning rules become prescriptive, embedded within the program that configures the device as a parallel distributed processor. However, when considering a parallel distributed processor built from scratch using electronic memory units linked in a network, or more clearly, its biological counterpart—the central nervous system—the descriptive nature of the rules governing synaptic excitation becomes evident.\\n\\nGiven their descriptive nature, it is unsurprising that the learning rules adopted by connectionists to enable network learning closely align with principles from traditional associationist and behaviorist learning theories. McClelland and Rumelhart (1988) trace their correlational learning rule back to Hebb (1949) and James (1890). Hebb\\'s principle is linked to Thorndike\\'s (1911) \"Law of Exercise,\" while James\\' formulation connects it to classical Pavlovian conditioning principles, as interpreted by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), and the principle of association by contiguity, which can be traced back through Aristotle\\'s \"De Memoria et Reminiscentia\" to Plato\\'s \"Phaedo.\"\\n\\nIn the case of the error-correcting or \"delta\" rule, the connection to traditional learning theory is less apparent due to concepts like \\'back-propagation,\\' \\'gradient descent,\\' and defining \\'error\\' as the difference between actual and target outputs. Nonetheless, the application of this principle to generate learning through trial and error correction, first described by Thorndike (1898) in his study of cats learning to escape a puzzle box, links the delta rule to Thorndike\\'s (1911) \"Law of Effect\" and Skinner\\'s (1981) \"Selection by Consequences.\" Thorndike\\'s formulation of the Law of Effect in terms of \\'satisfaction\\' and \\'dissatisfaction\\' connects it to the principle of psychological hedonism (Freud\\'s, 1900/1913, \"pleasure principle\"), with roots tracing back to Epicurus.\\n\\nIt is widely accepted that a parallel distributed processor more closely resembles the brain, both structurally and functionally, than a conventionally constructed S-D computer. However, according to Pinker and Prince (1988), connectionism—the movement advocating this model of brain function—exists in two forms:\\n1. **Implementational Connectionism**: This approach retains the S-D computer as a model for brain operation, suggesting that the \\'classical architecture\\' of the S-D device is implemented by a naturally occurring parallel distributed processor, similar to how most artificial parallel distributed processors are implemented on S-D computers.\\n2. **Eliminative Connectionism**: This approach proposes completely replacing the S-D computer model with the parallel distributed processor as a guide for understanding all brain functions across all levels of complexity.\\n\\nWhile it remains uncertain which version of connectionism will ultimately prevail, two points are clear:\\n1. As long as eliminative connectionism remains viable, the assertion that there is no alternative to the S-D computer model is unsustainable.\\n2. If connectionism follows the implementational path, linguistic theory will remain unaffected. However, if eliminative connectionism prevails, it could lead to a revolution as significant as the one initiated by Chomsky over thirty years ago.',\n"," '# The Implications of Eliminative Connectionism\\n\\nThe prediction that adopting the eliminative version of connectionism could lead to a scientific revolution in linguistic theory is based on two main factors: the features that disappear when the symbolic-digital (S-D) computer model is abandoned, and the positive attributes of the alternative neural network model. If the S-D computer is replaced by a parallel distributed processor, we can confidently predict the disappearance of four major doctrines within contemporary linguistic theory:\\n\\n1. Fodor\\'s idea that linguistically formulated thought precedes and enables interpersonal linguistic communication.\\n2. The shared belief of Chomsky and Fodor that sentences are generated by formal semantic and syntactic rules, represented by symbolic formulas inscribed in the brain, akin to a magnetic tape.\\n3. The notion that linguistic competence and the semantic and syntactic regularities essential for intelligible communication primarily depend on an innate capacity, whether it be Chomsky\\'s concept of \"deep structure\" or Fodor\\'s \"language of thought.\"\\n4. The idea that learning involves storing \"information\" in a localized memory within the brain, from which it can be \"retrieved\" as needed. In the case of word meanings, Katz and Fodor (1963) identify this memory store as the brain\\'s \"lexicon.\"\\n\\nWith the adoption of eliminative connectionism, we can expect these four doctrines to be replaced by:\\n\\n1. The traditional common-sense and behaviorist view that interpersonal linguistic communication precedes and enables linguistically formulated thought.\\n2. The notion that sentences are generated by irrational associations, which are shaped to conform to linguistic \\'rules\\' (more accurately described as \\'norms\\' or \\'conventions\\') through the error-correcting practices of the linguistic community, as reflected in the \\'back-channels\\' or \\'response tokens\\' provided by listeners during ordinary conversation.\\n3. The idea that linguistic competence and the semantic and syntactic regularities essential for intelligible communication are acquired and maintained through the process of correction and confirmation provided by listener responses.\\n4. The concept that learning occurs through the development of relatively permanent changes in the weights of numerous synaptic connections between the nodes or neurons that comprise the network.',\n"," '**The Argument for Revisiting Empiricist/Behaviorist Linguistics**\\n\\nGiven the current trends, it seems likely that if eliminative connectionism becomes the dominant paradigm and parallel distributed processing replaces the traditional S-D computer model for understanding how the brain interprets and generates language, linguistic theory may need to return to the empiricist and behaviorist approaches that were set aside following the Chomskyan revolution. However, convincing linguistic theorists to embrace this shift is uncertain. The growing popularity of eliminative connectionism in contemporary artificial intelligence alone is unlikely to sway linguists from the nativist/rationalist theories that have long been entrenched in the field. The decisive factor will be demonstrating that a network, when exposed to the same first language learning experiences as a typical child, can learn to construct and understand novel sentences in the same way. Achieving this remains a distant goal, even for the most ardent supporters of eliminative connectionism.\\n\\nProgress is hindered by the current limitations of connectionist models. Additionally, a significant obstacle is the skepticism among linguists towards approaches that resemble empiricist or behaviorist views of linguistic competence.',\n"," '# The Problem of Novel Sentence Construction and Interpretation\\n\\nTo convince linguists, it is essential to support two key propositions:\\n\\n1. A viable empiricist/behaviorist theory exists for understanding and constructing novel sentences.\\n2. There are compelling reasons to believe that such a theory is more likely to succeed in the long term compared to existing alternatives.\\n\\nSince Chomsky first highlighted the absence of such a theory in Skinner\\'s book \"Verbal Behavior,\" there have been, to my knowledge, two significant attempts to develop an empiricist/behaviorist theory for the construction and interpretation of novel sentences. One attempt is George Robinson\\'s chapter titled \"Procedures for the Acquisition of Syntax,\" included in the Honig and Staddon \"Handbook of Operant Behavior\" (1977). The other is my own work (Place 1983; 1990; 1992; forthcoming), which seeks to explain how novel sentences influence listener behavior through a version of Wittgenstein\\'s \"Picture Theory\" of sentence meaning, as developed in the \"Tractatus\" (Wittgenstein 1921/1971). According to this theory, novel sentences function as signs or \"discriminative stimuli,\" as Skinner (1938) describes them, for \"contingencies\" (i.e., antecedent-behavior-consequence relations) that the listener may not have previously encountered. Novel sentences achieve this through an isomorphism between the sentence\\'s structure and content and the structure and content of the contingency to which the listener is alerted.\\n\\nThese two accounts complement each other. Robinson\\'s work demonstrates how operant reinforcement (or \"error-correction,\" as a connectionist might term it) can explain how a child learns to construct syntactically well-formed sentences. My theory, which I call \"Contingency Semantics,\" aims to elucidate how these sentences can effectively control the listener\\'s behavior.',\n"," \"# Explaining the Evolution of Linguistic Communication\\n\\nTo date, neither of these theories has garnered significant attention from linguists. This is unlikely to change unless compelling reasons are presented to suggest that these theories can explain language acquisition and use more effectively and economically than existing alternatives. Are there such reasons? I believe there are.\\n\\nOne reason is that the empiricist/behaviorist theory offers a more plausible explanation for why only humans can learn to communicate through language. A major criticism of Chomsky's theory is its lack of explanation for how such a complex genetic endowment could have evolved. Fodor's theory circumvents this issue by attributing the language of thought to both animals and humans; however, it fails to explain why animals cannot utilize this innate linguistic ability for interpersonal communication.\\n\\nThe empiricist/behaviorist theory posits that acquiring linguistic competence relies on the same fundamental learning capacities available to other mammals. The evolution of language for interpersonal communication and symbolic thinking is linked to the development of vocal cords and the configuration of the mouth and palate necessary for vocal speech, alongside enhanced manipulative abilities associated with tool use and construction. This combination allows the phonemes and phoneme combinations of natural language to gain meaning through the evocation of specific patterns of manipulative behavior. This contrasts with parrots, which can produce sounds but lack the manipulative ability, rendering their sounds meaningless. This close connection between speech and manipulation explains the consistent use of gestures alongside speech and the use of sign language by the deaf as an alternative to vocal speech.\",\n"," '\\\\section*{The Role of Listener Reinforcement in the Acquisition of Linguistic Competence}\\n\\nA compelling reason to anticipate that the empiricist/behaviorist/eliminative connectionist theory of language will ultimately prevail is found in E. L. Moerk\\'s (1983) reinterpretation of Roger Brown\\'s (1973) study on how a mother acts as a first language teacher to her child. Brown\\'s study is often cited as evidence supporting the view that mothers do not correct their children\\'s syntax, suggesting that a child\\'s adherence to syntactic conventions is not learned through maternal instruction. However, Moerk\\'s re-analysis of Brown\\'s data indicates that Brown\\'s main conclusion—that a child\\'s linguistic competence develops independently of the learning experiences provided by the mother\\'s responses, whether intentional or unconscious—does not hold up.\\n\\nWhile it is true that mothers often refrain from correcting their children for using syntactically incorrect forms, opting instead to model the correct form after an initial \"Good girl!\", and are generous in interpreting their children\\'s attempts at communication, reinforcement theory would predict that children would acquire more deviant forms of speech than are typically observed. This assumption, however, overlooks the fact that a child\\'s acquisition of linguistic competence is not solely dependent on interactions with the mother. Although the mother-child interaction provides a crucial foundation, evidence suggests that a child\\'s interactions with peers play a more significant role in shaping the speech patterns ultimately acquired. While peer groups may not reinforce speech patterns that align with grammatical rules, they are less forgiving than mothers in interpreting what the child is trying to say. Deviations from the syntactic conventions recognized by the group often result in strong \"error messages,\" ranging from confusion and incomprehension to ridicule.',\n"," '\\\\section*{PLACE}\\n\\nIn this analysis, points where the current speaker completes a sentence are marked by an upward arrow. Notably, with only four exceptions, each sentence completion prompts an appropriate response or \"response token\" from the listener, a term favored by conversation analysts. The four exceptions are as follows:\\n\\n1. On line 11, Penny does not respond when Rose finishes the sentence \"they\\'re all on that list,\" which mirrors Penny\\'s previous sentence \"they\\'re on that list.\" This can be seen as a response to Penny\\'s sentence rather than a standalone sentence.\\n   \\n2. On lines 12 and 13, Penny\\'s \"yes\" anticipates the end of Rose\\'s sentence, as the completion is already evident.\\n\\n3 & 4. On lines 13-15, Penny engages in a complex self-directed reasoning process, which Rose ignores, likely because she is interested only in the conclusion, not the intricate thought process leading to it.\\n\\nAs observed in this excerpt, most response tokens are \"correct\" messages or reinforcers, such as expressions of agreement, comprehension, surprise, or sympathy. These serve to maintain the speaker\\'s verbal flow from sentence to sentence. Occasionally, this flow is interrupted by \"error\" messages or \"disinforcers,\" a term suggested by Harzem and Miles (1978). These take the form of disagreement, incomprehension, or disbelief, prompting the speaker to repeat, elaborate, or justify their statement. In this excerpt, the closest we come to an error message are the two requests for clarification and confirmation made by Rose on lines 08 and 11.\\n\\nFrom this evidence, three conclusions can be drawn:\\n\\n1. Response tokens play a crucial role in facilitating effective interpersonal linguistic communication.\\n\\n2. They function as \"correct messages\" or reinforcers when communication is smooth, and as \"error messages\" or disinforcers when communication falters.\\n\\n3. By ensuring the speaker adheres to the semantic and syntactic conventions of the language, they help maintain effective linguistic communication within the community of competent speakers.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Conclusion}\\n\\nIn a lecture delivered and published in 1987, Chomsky presented his perspective on language acquisition, stating:\\n\\n\\\\begin{quotation}\\nThe mind/brain is viewed as an information processing system that forms abstract representations and performs computations to use and modify them. This approach sharply contrasts with the study of behavior shaping and control, which systematically avoided considering the mental states involved in behavior and sought to establish direct relations between stimuli, contingencies, and behavior. In my view, this behaviorist approach has proven largely unproductive, which is unsurprising since it fundamentally refuses to consider the essential component of all behavior: the states of the mind/brain.\\n\\\\end{quotation}\\n\\nIronically, at the time these words were spoken, a new perspective on how the mind/brain functions was beginning to challenge Chomsky\\'s confident dismissal of the behaviorist approach to language acquisition. Why, nearly thirty years after his critique of \"Verbal Behavior,\" does Chomsky still feel the need to emphasize the shortcomings of behaviorism, which he and his colleagues have long declared obsolete? Could there be a lingering suspicion that the theory might yet resurface and challenge its critics?\\n\\nI share some of Chomsky\\'s criticism of Skinner\\'s reluctance to engage with the brain\\'s workings. Skinner was correct in asserting that we can and should study the relationship between behavior and environmental contingencies without preconceived notions about how the brain manages this relationship. However, to claim, as Skinner occasionally did, that behavioral psychologists should not concern themselves with such matters is clearly unreasonable. Nonetheless, Skinner\\'s resistance to neurophysiological speculation has had a positive outcome. It has prevented behavior analysts from following the trend of using the serial-digital computer as a model for brain function. Behavior analysts should recognize the advantage this gives them in understanding the implications of the connectionist revolution in artificial intelligence. If they do, they will be well ahead of those whose thinking has been dominated by the \"classical cognitive architecture.\" These individuals are now facing the challenging task of unlearning the thought patterns of a generation, if not a lifetime.',\n"," '\\\\section{2. Two Families of Cognitive Models}\\n\\nClassical computational architectures conceptualize cognitive processes as rule-based manipulations of internal symbols or data structures. In contrast, connectionist models do not rely on fixed representations for their operations. Instead, they consist of activated units (nodes) that influence the activation levels of other connected units until the system reaches a stable state. Semantic interpretations, if present, are assigned either to individual units (in localist networks) or to patterns of activation across multiple units (in distributed networks).\\n\\nAdvocates of the classically-inspired language of thought thesis (LOT; see Fodor 1987) argue that propositional attitudes can be understood as computational relationships to symbols in an internal code. According to this perspective, believing that Clinton is a Democrat involves a computational relationship characteristic of belief to an internal sentence that signifies \"Clinton is a Democrat.\" If the LOT is accurate, it would scientifically validate folk psychology by positing states that are not only type-correlated with propositional attitudes but also individuated, like propositional attitudes, by a relation type and a content sentence. Indeed, the LOT offers the potential for reducing commonsense psychology, as LOT-based explanations of mental processes would mirror the explanations provided by common sense.\\n\\nCurrent connectionist models generally do not have a clear relationship with folk psychology. This is partly because connectionism avoids the process/data structure distinction central to the classical approach and does not view mental processes as operations on (or relations to) data structures. As a result, connectionist states are not categorized along the two dimensions by which we classify propositional attitudes. Activated nodes in a network (or patterns of activation across multiple nodes) do not naturally interpret as relations to meaningful structures. (This is not to say that connectionist states could not be interpreted this way, but rather that they do not inherently suggest such interpretations.) Consequently, envisioning a connectionist-based validation of folk psychology is more challenging.\\n\\nHowever, skepticism about connectionism\\'s potential to provide a long-sought validation of commonsense psychology does not justify the claim that connectionism implies the falsity of folk psychology. This is similar to how quantum physics\\' inability to validate our commonsense ontology of medium-sized objects does not imply the nonexistence of tables or chairs. Let us now consider the most widely debated argument from connectionism to eliminativism.',\n"," '\\\\section{3. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s Argument}\\n\\nEliminativism arguments assume that folk psychology functions as a theory, making it a candidate for elimination or replacement. In this view, beliefs, desires, and other propositional attitudes are seen as elements of a commonsense theory. Central to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s (RSG) argument is the assertion that folk psychology is committed to a concept called propositional modularity. This concept suggests that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in generating other propositional attitudes and, ultimately, behavior (1991, 204).\\n\\nThe idea that beliefs and desires, as defined by folk psychology, are causally effective is supported by the fact that folk psychological explanations of behavior often cite a specific desire (along with relevant beliefs) as the cause. For instance, Alice\\'s decision to go to her office might be explained by her desire to send emails, even though she also wants to speak to her research assistant. If she didn\\'t want to send emails, her desire to speak to her assistant might have driven her behavior. The notion that beliefs and desires are functionally discrete states implies that it is reasonable to discuss acquiring or losing them individually. For example, it makes sense to say that after waking from a nap, Henry forgot he had unplugged the phone, while forgetting nothing else.\\n\\nRSG\\'s claim that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete states requires qualification due to the often-noted holism (or anatomism) of belief. If Henry has forgotten that he unplugged the phone, he has also forgotten (and thus does not currently believe) that he unplugged something, that he cannot be contacted by phone, etc. The individuation of belief in commonsense practice is detailed enough that these count as distinct beliefs. Therefore, it is doubtful that individual beliefs can be acquired or lost one at a time. However, setting this qualification aside, I will accept RSG\\'s claim that folk psychology is committed to something akin to propositional modularity. The question then becomes whether connectionism challenges the propositional modularity of beliefs and desires.\\n\\nThe Language of Thought (LOT) is clearly compatible with propositional modularity, as it posits states that are functionally discrete, semantically evaluable, and causally effective in behavior production, with which propositional attitudes are type-correlated. According to Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988, 57), \"conventional [computational] architecture requires distinct symbolic expressions for each state of affairs it can represent.\" Thus, if true, the LOT would explain the propositional modularity of beliefs and desires.\\n\\nSome connectionist networks are also compatible with propositional modularity. In \"localist\" connectionist models, individual units or small clusters of units are given a semantic interpretation. For example, if a unit representing \"fur\" is always activated when a unit representing \"dog\" is activated, the ensemble of these two units and their connection might be seen as the system\\'s representation of the proposition \"all dogs have fur.\"\\n\\nHowever, not all connectionist networks exhibit this type of functional localization. In all but the simplest networks, the connections between the input units (which encode the system\\'s input) and the output units (which encode the system\\'s computed output) are mediated by hidden units, which represent neither the input nor the output. RSG describe a class of connectionist cognitive models with the following properties: (1) individual hidden units (and weights and biases) in the network lack plausible symbolic interpretation; and (2) information encoding in these networks is not local but distributed across many nodes and connection strengths. These networks may be seen as holistically encoding a set of propositions, using what Smolensky (1988) calls \\'subsymbolic\\' representation, as none of the hidden units, weights, or biases can comfortably be construed as symbols.\\n\\nIn the connectionist models under consideration, no distinct state or part of the network represents any particular proposition. Large portions of the network (many units, connection strengths, and biases) are involved in each computation, with individual units, weights, and biases encoding information relevant to many propositions. The representation of any given proposition is widely distributed throughout the network. Such models do not posit distinct states that could be identified with the functionally discrete, semantically evaluable, causally effective states characterized by folk psychology, leading RSG to conclude:\\n\\nIf these models offer the best accounts of human belief and memory, we face an ontologically radical theory change—the kind that supports the conclusion that propositional attitudes, like caloric fluid and phlogiston, do not exist (1991, 218).\\n\\nRSG\\'s argument can be explicitly formulated as follows:\\n1. The network lacks functionally discrete, identifiable substructures that are semantically interpretable as representations of individual propositions.\\n2. Therefore, the representation of a particular proposition cannot plausibly be said to play a causal role in the network\\'s computation.\\n3. However, folk psychology is committed to the propositional modularity thesis, which implies that particular beliefs play causal roles in specific cognitive episodes.\\n4. Therefore, if the best models of human cognitive processes are distributed connectionist networks of the described sort, then folk psychology is false.\\n\\nWhile this argument may seem compelling, it fails to establish its conclusion. Point (1) is true for many connectionist models, known as \"distributed\" networks. However, point (2) follows from point (1) only if the representation of a particular proposition must be realized as a discrete, identifiable substructure to be causally effective. RSG do not provide an argument for this claim. To establish its truth, and thus claim (2) of their argument, RSG need to argue that distributed representations are epiphenomenal—that they play no causal roles in the network\\'s behavior—something they do not attempt. The growing literature on distributed representations does not view them as epiphenomenal (see, for example, Hinton, McClelland, and Rumelhart 1986, and Van Gelder 1991). If distributed connectionist models are taken at face value, and in the absence of an argument to the contrary, claim (2) of RSG\\'s argument appears to be false.\\n\\nThe argument from connectionism to eliminativism collapses with the apparent falsity of step (2). But suppose (2) were true. It might turn out that distributed representations are epiphenomenal—that the complex states assigned semantic interpretations in the best connectionist models play no causal roles in the networks\\' computations. The causal generalizations describing the networks\\' behavior, let us suppose, do not refer to these particular complex states. The semantic interpretation of these states in the envisioned models would play a purely heuristic role, allowing us to track what the network is doing. Would the eliminativist conclusion follow? It follows only if propositional attitudes, to be causally effective, must be realized as structures explicitly involved in the causal generalizations of a lower-level cognitive theory. However, assuming they must presupposes an unsubstantiated and very strong constraint on inter-theoretic compatibility. It is not generally true that the causal generalizations of a lower-level theory will refer to the complex structures that realize a causally effective state posited at a higher level of theory. Often, the complex will be arbitrary from the perspective of the lower-level theory. (This will be true even if the higher-level states are not multiply realized by lower-level structures.) For example, there is currently no biochemical characterization of the gene responsible for sickle cell anemia, but it is unlikely that the complex biochemical structure realizing the gene is theoretically significant from the perspective of biochemistry. Nonetheless, the likelihood that the causal generalizations of biochemistry do not refer to this particular structure does not undermine the molecular geneticist\\'s claim that the gene causes the sickle cell condition. (This example was suggested to me by Robert McCauley.) Similarly, the possibility that the complex structures precisely realizing beliefs and desires do not figure in the causal laws of cognitive-level science does not threaten the causal efficacy of propositional attitudes.\\n\\nNor is there any reason to assume that beliefs and desires must be realized as functionally discrete cognitive structures to satisfy the functional discreteness component of propositional modularity. It is not generally true that functionally discrete items posited at one level of theory must be realized by structures treated as functionally discrete at lower levels. The sickle cell gene, as characterized by molecular genetics, is functionally discrete—it plays a distinct role in phenotype development—yet the complex of chemical structures realizing it may have no discrete biochemical role.\\n\\nThe point here is that beliefs and desires need not be realized in structures that are causally effective, functionally discrete, and semantically evaluable as characterized by a lower-level theory to satisfy the demands of propositional modularity. This cluster of commitments describes how folk psychology itself characterizes such states. Thus, even if the representations of particular propositions were to turn out to be epiphenomenal from the standpoint of connectionist theory (because they play no characterizable causal roles in connectionist models), the eliminativist conclusion that RSG want would not follow.\\n\\nHowever, while RSG have failed to meet the eliminativist burden, the following concern may remain: if one\\'s entire psychological state underlies a particular belief, as seems to be the case in the connectionist models under consideration, does it not follow that propositional attitudes emerge from underlying psychological processes, and that there is no explanation of how beliefs are realized psychologically? Not necessarily. It remains true that the device has a particular belief because of the information represented in the system. Standing beliefs may well be explainable in terms of the learning history and connection strengths of the system, and occurrent beliefs (those causally effective in a particular behavioral episode) may be explainable in terms of the current pattern of activation of hidden nodes of the system. It is no mere accident that the network behaves as it does.\\n\\nConsider, once again, the functional discreteness component of propositional modularity. Recall that RSG (1991, 205) gloss it as the claim that \"it typically makes perfectly good sense to claim that a person has acquired (or lost) a single memory or belief,\" as, for example, it makes sense to say that after awakening from a nap, Henry forgot that he had unplugged the phone. By adjusting the input to a network, the activation levels of individual units, and the connection weights and biases of the ensemble, one can change the representations in a distributed connectionist network. It may not be transparent how this is to be accomplished for a particular proposition, as it is in classical models or localist connectionist networks, where one simply changes the local state (in classical models, by adding or deleting the appropriate data structure); however, inter-theoretic realization relations in science are rarely so tidy. (Forster and Saidel (forthcoming) describe a very simple distributed network where a single representation, realized in a distributed fashion, can be added to or deleted from the network\\'s representational repertoire, indicating that functional discreteness is not incompatible with non-discrete realization.)\\n\\nI have argued that propositional attitudes need not be realized by discrete computational-level structures to be causally effective and functionally discrete. RSG\\'s conclusion could be salvaged if the claim that propositional attitudes are realized by discrete computational structures is a fundamental commitment of folk psychology itself, entirely independent of its commitment to propositional modularity. If folk psychology did make such a claim, then it would rightly be viewed as, in part, a theory of psychological processes, and consequently a competitor to some forms of connectionism. In the next section, I shall argue that folk psychology makes no commitment regarding how propositional attitudes are realized and imposes no substantive constraints on cognitive architecture. If I am correct, then folk psychology is not incompatible with any form of connectionism.',\n"," '# 4. A Minimalist Interpretation of Folk Psychology\\n\\nMy critique of RSG does not assert that distributed connectionist networks inherently propose structured states that could be equated with propositional attitude tokenings. Nor does it rely on a neo-Rylean interpretation of folk psychology, which views beliefs and desires not as causally effective internal states but as abstract constructs derived from behavioral patterns (see Dennett 1991, Van Gelder, forthcoming), thus making them immune to eliminativist challenges.\\n\\nThe interpretation of folk psychology I advocate here, which suggests that our commonsense theory does not make substantial claims about the computational or physical realization of the internal causes of behavior, is termed the minimalist interpretation, or simply, minimalism. This minimalist interpretation can be seen as a specific instance of Mark Johnston\\'s broader Minimalist thesis, which posits that \"metaphysical pictures of the justificatory underpinnings of our practices do not represent the crucial conditions of justification of those practices\" (Johnston 1992, 590). Jackson and Pettit (1990) and Horgan and Graham (1991) have also supported versions of minimalism.\\n\\nMinimalism views folk psychology as aligned with the propositional modularity thesis: propositional attitudes are semantically evaluable internal states of agents, characterized by their roles in producing behavior and other mental states. These roles are defined by generalizations, such as:\\n- (S) (p) (A) [If S wants p, and S believes that doing A is the only way to achieve p, then (ceteris paribus) S will do A]\\n- (S) (p) (q) [If S believes p, and S comes to believe that if p then q, then (ceteris paribus) S will come to believe q]\\n- (S) (p) [If S fears p, then (ceteris paribus) S does not want p].\\n\\nThese generalizations, which collectively form a theory tacitly understood and used by people to explain mental phenomena and behavior, define propositional attitudes by their typical causes and effects, described intentionally. They do not address the physical or computational realization of these states.\\n\\nAs an interpretation of folk psychology, minimalism occupies a middle ground between neo-Rylean and behaviorist positions, which deny that propositional attitudes are causally effective internal states, and more extravagant interpretations of folk psychology. Defending the minimalist position requires arguments against both extremes.\\n\\nNeo-Ryleans typically view folk psychological explanations of behavior as rationalizing rather than causal. They argue that the purpose is to \"situate a piece of behavior in the space of reasons,\" showing it as rational (and thus predictable) in the circumstances, rather than citing actual causes. A non-causal interpretation of folk psychology shields it from seemingly adverse developments in empirical science. If the argument in the previous section is correct, such insulation is unnecessary. Moreover, a non-causal interpretation is not supported by actual practice.\\n\\nNeo-Ryleanism revises our shared explanatory practices. It seems we consider beliefs as effects of perception and inference and causes (along with desires) of action. We often say things like \"He believed he was about to be fired because he saw a confidential memo criticizing his job performance\" and \"She quit smoking because she believed it was affecting her health.\" There is no reason to assume that \"because\" functions differently here than in clearly causal statements like \"The fire started because the electrical system was overloaded.\" Claiming that commonsense explanations of belief fixation and action are not causal, despite appearances, places a significant burden of proof on the neo-Rylean.\\n\\nThe case for a causal interpretation of belief-desire attributions is not based solely on linguistic intuitions. Attribution theory, a branch of social psychology studying perceived causes of behavior, supports this view (see Heider 1958 for the classic statement of attribution theory; see Kelley and Michela 1980 and Weiner 1990 for more recent surveys). Attribution theory\\'s applications extend beyond folk psychology. For instance, attribution theorists argue that an agent\\'s self-esteem and susceptibility to depression depend on whether the primary determining factor (\"locus of causality\") of a behavioral event\\'s success or failure is an external condition beyond the agent\\'s control (e.g., luck) or an internal condition, such as an enduring character trait (see Peterson and Seligman 1984). A significant body of research in empirical psychology is based on the claim that beliefs, desires, and more permanent conditions like character traits are involved in causal explanations of behavior. For example, an agent\\'s failure to exert the effort required to achieve a goal may be attributed to the fear of failure, or a world-class athlete\\'s extraordinary efforts in adversity may be partly attributed to her belief in being the best in her sport. According to attribution theory, the propositional attitudes ascribed in such explanations are viewed (by people) as causes.\\n\\nWhile it is clear that folk psychology views beliefs and desires as internal causes, the evidence supports nothing stronger than minimalism. Minimalism contrasts sharply with extravagant interpretations of folk psychology, some of which claim that propositional attitudes, as explained by folk psychology, have a language-like structure (e.g., LOT) and must be realized by discrete computational states. Extravagant interpretations often underpin eliminativist arguments, although proponents of folk psychology, especially those anticipating that computational psychology will validate folk categories, have typically assumed extravagant interpretations as well. (Lycan 1991 and Rey 1991 assume that folk psychology views propositional attitudes as relations to mental representations; i.e., both assume a version of the LOT.) Folk psychology is better off without such allies. Tying folk psychology to specific processing-level proposals that claim to explain why the folk theory is true (or how it works) invites eliminativism. More importantly, extravagant interpretations are unsupported by folk psychological practice.\\n\\nIt has been noted that some form of intentional explanation is universal among adult humans (Forguson and Gopnik 1988, Fodor 1987). Notably, there is a significant degree of interpersonal agreement on belief and desire ascription, despite widely divergent opinions (or more accurately, ignorance) about what beliefs and desires truly are (i.e., what they are made of and how they perform their causal work). For predicting and explaining others\\' behavior—folk psychology\\'s special forte—it does not matter to its practitioners whether propositional attitudes are realized by discrete computational states, large-scale neural structures, or some mysterious soulstuff, where the global vs. local/discrete distinction has no clear application.\\n\\nThis point is undeniable when considering young children. Compelling evidence from developmental psychology shows that children have acquired the concepts of belief, desire, and intention by age six or seven (Astington, Harris, and Olsen 1988, Wellman 1990). By this time, the basic elements of our folk psychological understanding of ourselves are in place. Of course, young children often struggle to predict (and explain) others\\' behavior, and there is considerable disagreement among developmental psychologists regarding the correct explanation for their deficiencies (see Wimmer and Perner 1983 and Forguson and Gopnik 1988 for competing accounts). However, there is no evidence to suggest that young children\\'s problems with belief ascription stem from ignorance of our cognitive architecture, nor is there evidence that six-year-olds have a more sophisticated understanding of our cognitive architecture than younger children. Furthermore, developmental psychologists agree that by age six, children are proficient folk psychologists, although there is no evidence that by this age they have acquired a general belief that causally effective states must be realized by functionally discrete structures. (It is sometimes suggested that children have a crude \"billiard ball\" model of causation, but a mechanistic model of causation provides no support for claims about how beliefs and desires are internally realized.) The evidence supports a minimalist interpretation of folk psychology: young children are fully capable of attributing beliefs and desires to others; what they are attributing are simply semantically evaluable internal states that are causally effective in producing behavior (and other propositional attitudes). There is no evidence suggesting they have any beliefs about how these causally effective states are realized.\\n\\nWhat about adults? Attribution theory is again relevant, indicating that adults\\' conception of propositional attitudes is continuous with children\\'s. While people posit enduring, stable states that play causal roles in producing behavior, there is no evidence they share any particular views on underlying psychological or neural processes or mechanisms.\\n\\nThus, the available empirical evidence supports the minimalist interpretation of folk psychology over alternatives. Under this interpretation, folk psychology is not susceptible to eliminativist arguments that have been proposed, although it is conceivable that folk psychology could be false. Since propositional attitudes are internal causes, being behaviorally indistinguishable from a believer is not sufficient for being a believer. The behavior must be caused by internal states that play the causal roles characterized by folk psychological generalizations. The fact that a system\\'s behavior is predictable using folk psychological generalizations is compelling evidence that the system has such states and is a true believer. But this evidence is defeasible. I have argued that it would not be defeated by the failure of scientific psychology or neuroscience to find independently characterizable states or structures with which propositional attitude tokenings can be identified.\\n\\nHowever, it is not difficult to imagine a scenario where the behavioral evidence would be defeated. Consider a robot, behaviorally indistinguishable from a typical human (right down to behavioral dispositions), whose \"actions\" are produced by Martian scientists manipulating its motor and speech organs by remote control (cf. Peacocke\\'s 1983 story). Although folk psychological generalizations would be useful for predicting the robot\\'s behavior, the robot is not a model of folk psychology because its behavior is not caused by internal states of the sort characterized, in terms of their causal roles, by folk psychological generalizations. The robot\\'s behavior is not caused by its own beliefs and desires. It may have no internal states with the appropriate causal roles (i.e., no beliefs and desires). It seems to be merely a conduit for the intentions of others.\\n\\nIt is possible, therefore, to imagine circumstances where folk psychology would be false. If most of the \"human\" population were remote-controlled robots, then all \"output-side\" folk psychological generalizations—those purporting to explain behavior—would be false. Behavior would not be caused by the beliefs and desires of the behaving subject.\\n\\nLet us call the extrabehavioral condition on being a folk psychological subject the autonomy condition. I shall not attempt to give the autonomy condition a positive characterization—suffice it to say that it requires simply that the subject\\'s behavior is not the result of manipulation of its motor and speech organs by an external agent. There is indirect evidence to support the claim that the autonomy condition is an essential commitment of the folk psychological understanding of ourselves. Courts of law are often asked to rule on issues of intentional agency. In doing so, they consider not only the subject\\'s behavior but also whether the behavior was caused by the subject\\'s intentional states. Imagine a case where a person kills someone while under the control of a hypnotist. Assuming it could be determined that the killing was indeed the result of hypnotic suggestion, it would not be considered an intentional action of the hypnotized subject, and (provided he had not paid the hypnotist to make the fatal suggestion) the person would not be convicted of murder. The hypnotist is more likely to be regarded as the murderer, as the intentional action resulting in the death is attributable to him. The hypnotized subject\\'s behavior was not caused by the subject\\'s own beliefs and desires. It does not fall under a folk psychological generalization, precisely because the subject\\'s bodily movements were under the direct control of an external agent. We can generalize to get the autonomy condition—if all of a subject\\'s behavior were under the direct control of an external agent (e.g., a hypnotist), then since none of folk psychology\\'s output-side generalizations would be true of the subject, it would not be a model of folk psychology. Indeed, if the etiology of its behavior were understood, it is unlikely that such a subject would be considered a person.\\n\\nTo summarize the argument in this section: empirical evidence on the folk understanding of belief supports what I have called minimalism, the thesis that propositional attitudes are construed as causally effective internal states but denies that there are widespread views about how such states are realized. Since folk psychology imposes a minimal extrabehavioral condition on being a folk psychological subject (viz. autonomy), it is not compatible with every conceivable cognitive architecture. If most \"humans\" had the architecture of remote-controlled robots, then folk psychology would be false. But nothing short of fantastical scenarios of this sort would clearly falsify it. It is not threatened by discoveries about our cognitive architecture of the sort that connectionists are hoping for.',\n"," '### Section 5: Lingering Doubts: Another Eliminativist Argument\\n\\nConcerns may persist that distributed connectionism and folk psychology, while not inherently contradictory, do not naturally complement each other. To address these lingering doubts about their compatibility, I will conclude by examining a different argument linking connectionism to eliminativism. Martin Davies (1991), inspired by Gareth Evans, suggests a tension between connectionism and our commonsense understanding of ourselves as thinkers. According to Davies:\\n\\nA thinker who believes that \"a is F\" understands that it implies \"a is H,\" and similarly, from \"b is F,\" it follows that \"b is H.\" However, this is not merely about input-output patterns in the inferences a thinker is inclined to make. These inferences reflect a shared underlying capacity: mastery of the concept of being F (1991, 243).\\n\\nFor instance, someone who knows Oscar is a bachelor and Elmer is a bachelor understands that both are unmarried, due to their mastery of the concept of being a bachelor. Davies refers to this as the neo-Fregean conception of thought, claiming it is part of our commonsense understanding of what it means to be a thinker. He further explains:\\n\\nThe idea of a common capacity manifested in two inferences should be explained through a common state. In essence, there is causal systematicity relative to the input-output pattern in a thinker\\'s inferential practice (1991, 243-44).\\n\\nDavies provides an informal definition of causal systematicity: a process is causally systematic if it follows a discernible pattern in its input-output behavior. Suppose a generalization G describes such a pattern. Then, the requirement for causal systematicity relative to G is that there should be a mechanism explaining all input-output transitions conforming to G. This common mechanism must mediate between inputs and outputs according to G. Causal systematicity requires a real commonality of process (ibid., pp. 235-36).\\n\\nDavies\\' interpretation of the neo-Fregean conception of thought in terms of causal systematicity imposes a constraint on internal architecture, which can be formulated as follows:\\n\\nA has a concept \\\\( p \\\\) only if there is a computational state (structure) of type \\\\( m \\\\) such that (i) \\\\( m \\\\) realizes the concept \\\\( p \\\\) in A, and (ii) \\\\( m \\\\) is uniformly deployed in all cognitive processes involving the concept \\\\( p \\\\).\\n\\nI will call this the uniform realization constraint. According to Davies, our commonsense understanding of ourselves as thinkers commits us to this constraint on cognitive architecture.\\n\\nHe further notes that distributed connectionist models typically lack the syntactically structured representations seemingly required by causal systematicity. Specifically, they do not satisfy the uniform realization constraint. In distributed connectionist networks, a proposition is represented as a pattern of activation over many units. As Smolensky (1988) acknowledges, the subpatterns of activation representing coffee in various contexts—coffee in a cup, coffee in a jar, coffee with sugar—are \"activity vectors that are not identical but possess a rich structure of commonalities and differences\" (p. 17). Strictly speaking, in such networks, there is no common subpattern of activity that can be identified as a realization of the concept of coffee. Hence, there is no component or state of the network uniformly deployed in all coffee transitions. These networks, therefore, fail to satisfy the uniform realization constraint on concepts.\\n\\nThe similarity between Davies\\' argument and Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s (1988) systematicity argument is evident. Fodor and Pylyshyn conclude that because no common constituent is uniformly deployed in all transitions involving a concept, connectionist networks cannot explain a pervasive feature of thought that classical models readily explain, rendering them inadequate as theories of cognition. However, Davies draws an eliminativist conclusion: since our commonsense understanding of ourselves as thinkers is committed to causal systematicity (via the neo-Fregean conception of thought), and thus to the uniform realization constraint, connectionism is incompatible with this commonsense conception. According to Davies, a being whose cognitive architecture is accurately described as a distributed connectionist network will fail to meet a necessary condition for being a believer. If distributed connectionist models provide the best accounts of our internal architecture, we are not believers.\\n\\nIn response to those who assert that our status as believers is unquestionable, Davies argues that the only refuge from the eliminativist threat is behaviorism:\\n\\nIf it is non-negotiably true that we who produce interpretable behavior are thinkers, then the concept of a thinker must impose no necessary conditions beyond behavior. In particular, it must impose no necessary conditions on internal cognitive architecture. But this implies a form of behaviorism. . . .\\n\\nThis form of behaviorism is arguably incompatible with the commonsense scheme. . . . If the choice is between behaviorism and facing eliminativism, many of us know which way we are voting (1991, 255).\\n\\nDavies presumably intends to vote for eliminativism. However, if I am correct that folk psychology is best understood in minimalist terms, then he presents a false dilemma. Our commonsense scheme imposes minimal conditions beyond behavior, yet it is not vulnerable to eliminativist arguments like those Davies offers.\\n\\nFolk psychology, in its minimalist interpretation, is compatible with the neo-Fregean conception of thought. According to this conception, the inferences a thinker is inclined to make are manifestations of a common underlying capacity, namely, the mastery of a particular concept. The minimalist can endorse this claim, although it is unclear what, if anything, follows from it. Folk psychology has little to say about concepts beyond that they are constituents of thoughts, in the sense of propositions or senses (i.e., in Frege\\'s sense of \"thought\"). Mastery of a concept, for all folk psychology suggests, might involve mentally grasping objects in Platonic heaven. On the other hand, a behaviorist analysis of concepts, treating them as unanalyzed dispositions to draw certain inferences, is compatible with a realist interpretation of propositional attitudes (where beliefs and desires are causally efficacious internal states of agents). Folk psychology makes no commitments regarding what mastery of a concept involves (i.e., how concepts are realized computationally or deployed in psychological processes). Specifying the psychological mechanisms underlying concept mastery is of no interest to the folk—it is a task for cognitive scientists. In \"unpacking\" the neo-Fregean conception of thought in terms of causal systematicity (with its commitment to the uniform realization constraint), Davies introduces substantive commitments about cognitive architecture that folk psychology does not address.\\n\\nLet us say, then, that folk psychology is committed, at most, to a simplified version of the neo-Fregean conception of thought, which claims that the inferences a thinker is inclined to make are manifestations of a common underlying capacity, namely, mastery of a concept, but makes no claims about how this capacity is exercised or what mastery of a concept involves. (Frege himself would likely prefer this simplified version, given his famous opposition to the psychologizing of thought.) The question, then, is whether distributed connectionist models of psychological processing are compatible with this simplified neo-Fregean conception of thought. There is no reason to think they are not. Nothing prevents us from describing the network\\'s F-involving inferences as manifestations of a mastery of the concept of being F, provided that mastery of a concept does not require a common computational state or structure mediating all F-involving inferences, which, according to the simplified neo-Fregean conception of thought, it does not.\\n\\nThe problem with Davies\\' argument is that the account of concept mastery at play (in the \"overdressed\" version of the neo-Fregean conception) is itself an integral part of the classical computational picture of thought. It is unsurprising, therefore, that distributed connectionist models appear incompatible with it. The account of concept mastery implicit in the causal systematicity assumption and the uniform realization constraint does not by itself entail the LOT thesis (because the computational states or structures involved in the relevant inferences do not necessarily constitute a language). Nonetheless, it involves substantive commitments about psychological processing that go well beyond the folk psychological conception of thought. The failure of connectionist cognitive models to align with such an account, therefore, has no eliminativist implications.\\n\\nThe lingering concern that distributed forms of connectionism do not align well with folk psychology may stem from a similar source. In the twenty years since the publication of Fodor\\'s seminal book (1975), the classical computational model of the mind has become the dominant view in the philosophy of mind. It is unsurprising that integral components of this conception, such as the account of concept mastery underlying Davies\\' argument, have permeated the collective philosophical consciousness to the point where it may be difficult for philosophers to separate these components from the body of theory they share with ordinary folk. But they should be separated. The perceived tension indicates the extent to which distributed connectionism diverges from its more entrenched computational rival; it does not reflect any incompatibility with the folk conception of the mind.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{2. From Connectionism to Eliminativism}\\n\\nIntentional eliminativists aim to deny the existence of intentional entities, suggesting that a mature theory of mind will not include entities with properties similar to beliefs and desires. This leads to a general eliminativist strategy: to extract the essential properties of intentional entities from commonsense psychology and demonstrate that these properties are incompatible with the framework intended to underpin our advanced cognitive psychology.\\n\\nIt is unsurprising, then, that this strategy is employed in the reasoning that links connectionism with eliminativism. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, for instance, pursue this strategy by identifying several essential properties that commonsense psychology attributes to intentional entities:\\n\\nCommonsense psychology is rich with insights about beliefs, memories, desires, hopes, fears, and other propositional attitudes. The key folk psychological claims connecting connectionism and eliminativism are that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in producing other propositional attitudes and, ultimately, behavior. (forthcoming, Section 3)\\n\\nThey argue that entities with these properties cannot be instantiated in connectionist models:\\n\\nThe information encoded in a connectionist network is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network. When information is extracted by providing an input string, many connection weights, biases, and hidden units contribute to the computation.\\n\\nDue to this highly distributed manner of encoding information, where each connection weight and bias embodies information relevant to many stored representations, and information about any given representation is scattered throughout the network, the system lacks functionally distinct, identifiable substructures that can be semantically interpreted as representations of individual propositions. (forthcoming, Section 5)\\n\\nThis leads them to conclude:\\n\\nIn connectionist models, there is nothing that can be plausibly identified with the propositional attitudes of commonsense psychology. If these models prove to be the best explanations of human belief and memory, we will face an ontologically radical theory change—a change that supports the conclusion that propositional attitudes, like caloric and phlogiston, do not exist. (forthcoming, Section 7)\\n\\nAccording to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, connectionism leads to eliminativism because connectionist models use a distributed form of representation. This distributed system results in the absence of functionally discrete, semantically interpretable substructures that can be identified with the intentional entities of commonsense psychology.\\n\\nHowever, the situation is not as straightforward as it seems. While it is true that connectionist models employ a distributed form of representation, this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that there are no functionally discrete, semantically interpretable substructures in these systems. Let's explore this further in the next section.\",\n"," \"\\\\section*{3. The Role of Activation Patterns in Connectionist Models}\\n\\nThe reasoning presented in the previous section is flawed due to its incomplete characterization of the processing activities within connectionist models. This incompleteness arises from neglecting what we might call the 'network properties' of these models. These properties are not found at the level of individual processing units and connection weights that make up a connectionist network, but rather at the level of the entire network itself. By shifting our perspective to consider the activity of connectionist models at the network level, we uncover a significant amount of information processing structure that Ramsey, Stich, and Garon did not address.\\n\\nAmong these network-level properties, the most crucial for our current discussion are the activation patterns generated across connectionist networks during their processing activities. Contrary to the reasoning in the previous section, these activation patterns represent functionally discrete sub-structures of connectionist systems.\\n\\nAn activation pattern is generated in a connectionist network whenever it is exposed to an input through its input units. This pattern consists of the individual activation values of all, or more commonly, a large subset of the processing units within the network. As such, the activation pattern exists as a physically structured, isolable state of the network. Moreover, activation patterns are not merely passive features of connectionist models; they have distinct causal effects on the information-processing activities of these systems. This causal involvement is significant because the activation pattern represents the network's 'solution' to the 'problem' posed by the input array. In other words, it represents the computation that the network as a whole performs (as opposed to the computations performed locally by individual units) in response to its input. The resultant activation pattern is then used to initiate further causal activity, either serving as input to another network in the system or as an instruction to a motor response mechanism connected to the network.\\n\\nThus, activation patterns not only represent functionally discrete sub-structures of connectionist systems but also serve as a central causal mechanism for information processing in these systems. Because these sub-structures play such a significant causal role in the information processing activities of connectionist models, they are precisely the kinds of entities that might support discrete semantic interpretations. Indeed, they typically do sustain such interpretations in existing connectionist models, as even a brief exploration of the relevant literature will confirm. For example, consider the connectionist model of human learning and memory by McClelland and Rumelhart (1986a) and the model of past tense acquisition by Rumelhart and McClelland (1986a), both of which have been extensively discussed in the literature.\\n\\nConsequently, it seems reasonable to suggest that the activation patterns of connectionist models might be the appropriate sub-structures to instantiate the intentional entities of commonsense psychology. In fact, this thesis naturally presents itself. If this thesis can be sustained, the eliminativist reasoning we encountered in the previous section fails to hold: connectionism and commonsense psychology are indeed compatible.\",\n"," '**4. Transient Activation Patterns and Enduring Beliefs**\\n\\nAn apparent objection arises against the current thesis. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon articulate it as follows:\\n\\nThe proposal suggests identifying the system\\'s activation pattern with the belief that \\\\( p \\\\). However, this seems implausible. In commonsense psychology, beliefs and propositional memories typically endure and are numerous, even when not actively used. An activation pattern, however, is not a lasting state of a network; it only exists when the network receives the relevant input. Moreover, individuals hold numerous beliefs over long periods, but it is unreasonable to assume a network could maintain many activation patterns simultaneously over time. At any moment, a network can exhibit only one activation pattern. Thus, activation patterns cannot plausibly be equated with beliefs or their representations (forthcoming, Section 6).\\n\\nRamsey, Stich, and Garon correctly note that activation patterns lack endurance. Each pattern is a transient state within a connectionist network, likely to be replaced with new input. They also accurately observe that a network generates only one activation pattern at a time, reflecting the network\\'s current unique activation state. Their analysis of commonsense psychology is also accurate: beliefs typically endure and are numerous. Therefore, the thesis proposed earlier—that intentional entities are instantiated by activation patterns in connectionist networks—appears untenable from this perspective.\\n\\nHowever, rather than dismissing the thesis as a non-starter, I argue that it requires supplementation. This supplementation is not difficult to find; it involves revisiting the network-level properties of connectionist networks. While the activation pattern lacks endurance, there is another network-level feature associated with it that does not: the network\\'s disposition to generate this activation pattern.\\n\\nThese dispositions are stored in the network\\'s \\'connectivity matrix,\\' which includes the pattern of unit connectivity and the specific weights on the connections between units. The connectivity matrix determines the network\\'s response to a given input, dictating which activation pattern will be generated. Thus, each transient activation pattern is associated with a specific configuration of the network\\'s connectivity matrix, which determines its generation in response to a specific input. This configuration represents the network\\'s disposition to generate the activation pattern, and unlike the activation pattern, this disposition endures indefinitely within the connectivity matrix.\\n\\nIn connectionist models, we must distinguish between two intimately related network-level properties: network activation patterns and connectivity matrix dispositions to generate these patterns. With a discrete semantic interpretation of activation patterns, we can say that connectionist models differentiate between the explicit representation of information by activation patterns and the implicit representation by connectivity matrix dispositions.\\n\\nThe terms \\'explicit\\' and \\'implicit\\' are used cautiously, as they have different meanings in the classical computational framework. In the classical framework, information is explicitly represented if a symbol structure correlated with it is explicitly tokened in the system. Daniel Dennett defines it as follows:\\n\\nInformation is explicitly represented in a system if there exists a physically structured object, a formula, or a tokening of elements for which there is a semantics or interpretation, and a mechanism for reading or parsing the formula (1982, p. 216).\\n\\nIn the connectionist framework, explicit representation is similar: information is correlated with a physically structured object, an activation pattern, which can have a discrete semantic interpretation. The key difference is that in connectionism, there is no executive system to parse this pattern; activation patterns are \\'self-motivating,\\' initiating causal activity by their presence.\\n\\nThe real divergence in terminology between the two frameworks occurs with \\'implicit representation.\\' In classicism, information is implicitly represented when it is entailed by explicitly represented information. Dennett states: \"Information is implicitly represented if it is logically implied by something stored explicitly\" (1982, p. 216). However, in connectionism, implicit representation by connectivity matrix dispositions means that information is physically encoded by the system, not merely entailed by explicit representations.\\n\\nThis physical encoding is peculiar. Implicit representations are encoded by specific configurations of a network\\'s connectivity matrix but not in a physically discrete manner. One cannot pinpoint the \\'bit\\' representing a disposition to generate a specific activation pattern. Instead, implicit representations are encoded holistically, as a single connectivity matrix stores multiple dispositions to generate distinct activation patterns, implicitly encoding various information items. The matrix manifests these dispositions through activation patterns, while at other times, the dispositions are indistinguishable.\\n\\nThis connectionist distinction between explicit and implicit representation has no parallel in classicism and is a significant feature distinguishing connectionism. It also highlights why connectionism represents an advancement over classicism.\\n\\nWith this distinction, the necessary modification to our original thesis becomes clear. Instead of claiming that intentional entities of commonsense psychology are instantiated solely by activation patterns, we extend this to include the associated connectivity matrix dispositions. This resolves the endurance issue, as the transient nature of activation patterns is complemented by the persistent connectivity matrix dispositions. This also addresses how a connectionist model can represent multiple beliefs and desires simultaneously, as a single connectivity matrix can implicitly encode various information items in a superpositional manner.',\n"," '\\\\section*{5. The Causal Dynamics of Beliefs and Desires}\\n\\nFor some readers, extending the original thesis might seem like jumping from the frying pan into the fire. While it may address the problem of endurance, it could be perceived as damaging our commonsense understanding of the causal dynamics of beliefs and desires. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, for instance, express this concern:\\n\\n\"While dispositions to produce activation patterns are indeed enduring states of the system, they are not the right sort of enduring states—they are not the discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires.\" (forthcoming, Section 6)\\n\\nThere are two distinct claims here. The first is that commonsense psychology is fundamentally committed to the discrete causal activity of the intentional entities it postulates. The second is that connectivity matrix dispositions do not exhibit causal activity in this discrete manner.\\n\\nIn defense of their first claim, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon analyze the causal dynamics of the commonsense framework. They elaborate:\\n\\n\"On the commonsense view, it may sometimes happen that a person has a number of belief clusters, any one of which might lead him to infer some further belief. When he actually does draw the inference, folk psychology assumes that it is an empirical question what he inferred it from, and that this question typically has a determinate answer. Suppose, for example, that Inspector Clouseau believes the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel, and that he said he arrived back on the morning train. Suppose Clouseau also believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, and that the morning train has been taken out of service. Given these beliefs, along with some widely shared background beliefs, Clouseau might well infer that the butler is lying. If he does, folk psychology presumes that the inference might be based either on his beliefs about the hotel, or on his beliefs about the train, or both. It is entirely possible, from the perspective of commonsense psychology, that although Clouseau has long known that the hotel is closed for the season, this belief played no role in his inference on this particular occasion. [And so here] we see commonsense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert.\" (forthcoming, Section 3)\\n\\nThe moral of this story, according to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, is that commonsense psychology views intentional entities as causally active in an isolable, discrete fashion. They always interact causally as individuals.\\n\\nIn defense of their second claim, that connectivity matrix dispositions do not interact causally in this isolable, discrete fashion, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon write:\\n\\n\"In a distributed connectionist system... the dispositional state which produces one activation pattern is functionally inseparable from the dispositional state which produces another. Thus it is impossible to isolate some [items of information] as causally active in certain episodes, while others are not.\" (forthcoming, Section 6)\\n\\nThe point here is that connectivity matrix dispositions are not isolable features of connectionist networks. This means, according to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, that it is impossible to isolate the causal activity of any individual disposition, and thus any individual item of information implicitly stored in the network. Instead, due to the holistic nature of information encoding, all the information encoded in the network\\'s connectivity matrix is causally implicated in any processing the network undertakes.\\n\\nTogether, these two claims challenge the modified version of our thesis. They suggest that we cannot equate connectivity matrix dispositions with beliefs and desires because the former cannot replicate the causal properties of the latter. Consequently, if we are to continue supporting our thesis, we must demonstrate that at least one of these claims is untenable.\\n\\nThe second claim seems difficult to refute. While Ramsey, Stich, and Garon are not entirely correct in arguing that connectivity matrix dispositions are functionally inseparable (as they are functionally separable when they are causally implicated in generating their associated activation patterns in a network), it is clear that these dispositions do not always interact causally in a functionally discrete manner. This leaves us with the first claim, that commonsense psychology is committed to the universal causal discreteness of the intentional entities it quantifies over.\\n\\nWith this first claim in mind, it is worth remembering that the explicit representations of connectionist networks do indeed have isolable causal consequences. So connectionism is actually committed to a certain amount of causal discreteness. However, if we were to argue that whenever commonsense required the causal activity of a belief or a desire, then this belief or desire would have to be explicitly represented in a connectionist model, we would encounter insurmountable difficulties. As we have seen, information in connectionist systems need not be explicitly represented to be causally efficacious. Implicit beliefs and desires will exert influence regardless. Thus, if commonsense is committed to universal causal discreteness, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon are correct: commonsense psychology would not survive a connectionist revolution.\\n\\nHowever, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon are mistaken about commonsense psychology\\'s commitment to universal causal discreteness. In truth, commonsense is actually committed to a significant degree of what we might call causal holism. The best way to see this is to reconsider the causal dynamics of the commonsense framework.\\n\\nConsider again Inspector Clouseau\\'s inference that the butler is lying. From the commonsense perspective, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon inform us, this inference was based either on Clouseau\\'s beliefs about the hotel (i.e., his belief that the butler said he stayed the night at the village hotel, and his belief that the village hotel is closed for the season) or on Clouseau\\'s beliefs about the train (i.e., his belief that the butler said he had arrived back on the morning train, and his belief that the morning train has been taken out of service) or on both. Moreover, they continue, whichever beliefs were responsible were causally active in a functionally discrete fashion—it is entirely possible, for example, that either of these sets of beliefs was inert in this particular cognitive episode.\\n\\nPerhaps. But what else does the commonsense framework say about the causal processes behind this inference? For a start, it would seem that Clouseau\\'s inference was also based on his (clearly longstanding) belief that to lie, one must say something untruthful. So this belief must have been causally involved as well. Then there is Clouseau\\'s (again longstanding) belief that a hotel is a place where one can stay overnight, as well as his belief that if a hotel is closed for the season, one cannot stay there overnight. These beliefs, too, it would seem, were causally implicated to some degree. Similarly, there is Clouseau\\'s belief that a train is something that can transport people from one place to another, and his belief that if a particular train has been taken out of service, it can\\'t transport people.\\n\\nSince we have started down this track, we might as well continue. If we examine Clouseau\\'s inference with our commonsense framework, we can uncover more longstanding beliefs that were causally implicated somewhere along the line. There is, for instance, Clouseau\\'s belief that \\'night\\' denotes a particular period during which it is normal for people to sleep, and his belief that people usually prefer to sleep in comfortable surroundings, as well as his belief that hotels generally provide such comfortable surroundings. Similarly, there is Clouseau\\'s belief that \\'morning\\' denotes a period following night, and his further belief that it is normal in the morning for people to stop sleeping and resume activity.\\n\\nI could continue extracting further relevant beliefs, but the moral is already clear. This is the well-appreciated (and for researchers in artificial intelligence, frustrating) fact that even relatively simple inferences require the causal involvement of a large amount of background detail. While commonsense psychology provides economical explanations of these cognitive episodes, these explanations hinge on numerous longstanding beliefs that must be considered in any thorough account of the causal processing involved. Given that our commonsense framework acknowledges these longstanding beliefs as causally active behind the scenes, what does it say about how they make their presence felt? Or, put another way, does commonsense require that all these background beliefs are causally implicated in a functionally discrete fashion?\\n\\nI think it is clear that it doesn\\'t. Insofar as our commonsense understanding provides any elucidation of the causal machinery here, the tendency is to say that these background beliefs are only \\'implicitly\\' involved. In Clouseau\\'s case, for example, we would say that in making his inference about the butler\\'s deception, he simply \\'took for granted\\' a wealth of background detail about hotels, trains, and so forth. This suggests that commonsense psychology requires a causal framework in which large numbers of relevant longstanding beliefs are simultaneously brought to bear on a cognitive task, allowing Clouseau, for example, to take a lot of information for granted while making what is, for him, a relatively straightforward inference.\\n\\nThis conception of the causal dynamics of intentional entities differs from that proposed by Ramsey, Stich, and Garon. They may be right in thinking that, from the commonsense perspective, certain of Clouseau\\'s beliefs are causally efficacious in a functionally discrete fashion (we might say this about those beliefs that consciously occur to him during his inference), but they are wrong to think that all relevant beliefs in this cognitive episode are causally efficacious in such a manner. Instead, as we have seen, commonsense seems to require a good deal of causal holism. It seems to require a computational framework in which large numbers of relevant beliefs can be causally efficacious without being individually processed.\\n\\nAt this point, we can reverse the line of reasoning that leads from connectionism to eliminativism. But before doing so, it is instructive to consider why Ramsey, Stich, and Garon feel so strongly inclined to argue that commonsense is committed to universal causal discreteness. The explanation is not difficult to find and, once revealed, can be turned to our advantage.\\n\\nThe explanation lies in the work of Jerry Fodor, a prominent contemporary intentional realist. Fodor is renowned for his attempt to provide commonsense psychology with a principled basis. He has combined the ontology of commonsense with the causal dynamics of classical computation to develop what he calls the representational theory of mind (RTM) (1976, 1987). One central feature of Fodor\\'s RTM is particularly relevant to our discussion. As Fodor explains:\\n\\n\"According to [RTM], mental processes are causal sequences of transformations of mental representations. It follows that tokenings of attitudes must correspond to tokenings of mental representations when they—the attitude tokenings—are episodes in mental processes. If the intentional objects of such causally efficacious attitude tokenings are not explicitly represented, then RTM is simply false. I repeat for emphasis: If the occurrence of a thought is an episode in a mental process, then RTM is committed to the explicit representation of its content. The motto is therefore No Intentional Causation without Explicit Representation.\" (1987, pp. 24-25)\\n\\nThis should sound familiar. Here is Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s doctrine of universal causal discreteness: intentional entities, according to Fodor\\'s RTM, cannot be causally active unless they are identifiable with explicit, and therefore functionally discrete, representations in the language of thought. The point is that Ramsey, Stich, and Garon have not derived this doctrine from commonsense psychology; they have distilled it from Fodor\\'s RTM.\\n\\nRTM is committed to this doctrine because of its commitment to the causal dynamics of the classical computational framework, which requires representational entities to be causally efficacious in a functionally discrete manner. Moreover, it is precisely because RTM is committed to the universal causal discreteness entailed by its classical framework that it encounters difficulties. The initial enthusiasm for the classical computational framework in the 1960s and 1970s has, in recent years, been replaced by sobriety and disillusionment as cognitive scientists have found that vast increases in processing speed and memory capacity have not led to the promised computational solutions to even basic cognitive tasks. The conclusion many have drawn is that it is implausible to suppose that our brains explicitly retrieve and manipulate a colossal number of discrete symbol structures every time we perform the simplest inferences. What is required, as our analysis of commonsense psychology attests, is a computational framework in which large numbers of representational states, specifically longstanding beliefs, can causally influence a cognitive decision without being individually processed. What is required, in short, is a computational framework that, unlike classicism, can incorporate a significant degree of causal holism.',\n"," '\\\\section*{2 The Problem}\\n\\nRamsey, Stich, and Garon begin with the premise that folk psychology functions as a theory, positing states such as beliefs and desires. They argue that this theory is ripe for replacement because it cannot possibly encompass all there is to know about psychology. Central to the folk psychologist\\'s framework, they assert, is the concept of propositional modularity (1991, p. 204). Propositional modularity suggests that propositional attitudes are:\\n\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item Functionally discrete,\\n\\\\item Semantically interpretable, and\\n\\\\item Causally influential in mental and behavioral outcomes.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\nIn traditional folk psychological models, it is evident when a functionally distinct representation, like a belief, plays a causal role. However, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon highlight that certain connectionist models challenge the notion of propositional modularity. These connectionist models are potential candidates to replace their folk psychological counterparts.\\n\\nThey present two examples of their own design: Network A and Network B. Both networks encode simple propositions, such as \"Cats have fur\" and \"Dogs have legs,\" using binary strings of length 16. These binary strings serve as input to the network\\'s 16 input nodes. The hidden layer consists of four units, and there is a single output node that, after training, registers a \"1\" (or very close to it) for a true proposition and a \"0\" (or very close to it) for a false proposition. Network A was trained on 16 propositions using backpropagation until it could accurately distinguish true from false within the training set. It demonstrated \"generalization\" by affirmatively responding to the new proposition \"Cats have legs\" and negatively to \"Cats have scales,\" both of which were not in its training set. Network B, similar in architecture to Network A, included one additional proposition, \"Fish have eggs,\" in its training set, totaling 17 propositions. After training, Network B performed similarly to Network A in terms of accuracy and generalization.\\n\\nRamsey, Stich, and Garon argue that, unlike classical models, connectionist networks like Networks A and B lack distinct states or parts that represent specific propositional contents. Information storage is distributed across the network and is holistic. Following Smolensky (1988), this type of representation is termed subsymbolic. Consequently, any particular unit or weight value can encode information about multiple contents.\\n\\nThey claim that connectionist models of this nature possess three properties (Ramsey et al. 1991, p. 207):\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item Information encoding in the weights is widely distributed, not localized.\\n\\\\item Individual units lack symbolic interpretation—they are subsymbolic.\\n\\\\item These models are not intended as mere implementations but as genuine (and ontologically radical) cognitive theories that compete with traditional cognitive theories.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nGiven the stark contrast between propositional modularity and connectionist models, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon observe:\\n\\n\"It simply makes no sense to ask whether or not the representation of a particular proposition plays a causal role in the network\\'s computation. It is in just this respect that our connectionist model of memory seems radically incongruent with the propositional modularity of common sense psychology. For ... common sense psychology seems to presuppose that there is generally some answer to the question of whether a particular belief or memory played a causal role in a specific cognitive episode. But if belief and memory are subserved by a connectionist network like ours, such questions seem to have no clear meaning.\" (Ramsey et al. 1991, p. 212).\\n\\nSince connectionist networks lack modular propositional states, they do not possess the discrete features necessary to fall under psychological generalizations. Traditionally, seeing an F generally leads to the belief B, that F. A law connects the object F with the belief B. However, according to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s analysis, there are no discrete, functionally distinct belief states or structures like B implemented by all networks that appear to exemplify such beliefs. Thus, Network A\\'s belief that F will differ from Network B\\'s belief that F, as the individual weights and unit activations, and hence their internal representations, are necessarily different. They further claim that \"these networks have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of connectionist theory\" (Ramsey et al. 1991, p. 213).\\n\\nIn the following sections, I will argue against Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, demonstrating that neural networks do possess states that satisfy the claims of Propositional Modularity. These states can include a conjunction of input, hidden unit, and weight states, as will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4. In Section 5, I will show how a proper interpretation of these states relates to the existing literature on Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s paper and avoids eliminativism concerning belief.',\n"," '\\\\section*{3 Neural Correlates of Belief}\\n\\nI find much to agree with in the account provided by Ramsey, Stich, and Garon. I concur that encoding in connectionist networks is distributed and that individual units seldom have a symbolic interpretation. However, I do not believe that accepting these points implies that such networks do not represent anything at all. I contend that there are connectionist—and ultimately neural—correlates of belief.\\n\\nLet me begin by dispelling a common myth: the notion that neural networks lack distinct states or components that represent specific contents. Consider Networks A and B, previously claimed to lack distinct states representing particular propositional contents. We seem to have conveniently overlooked the input units. These units represent propositional contents in a distinct and straightforward manner and are integral parts of the network. Thus, it appears that the network does indeed represent propositions. It is a distributed representation, much like the English sentence \"Cats have fur,\" which is distributed across letters to represent the proposition that cats have fur.\\n\\nThis might seem like a sleight of hand, but it is not. Presumably, connectionist models are valuable for explaining human (and other animal) cognitive phenomena. Humans have their analogs of input units: the senses and their neural pathways to the brain. These inputs vary systematically with external conditions. When an infant and an adult observe a flower, they both experience nearly identical retinal, optical tract, optical chiasm, and cortical (V1-V4, for example) stimulations. Their retinas and sensory delivery systems carry the same information, which is distributed: the entire retina may be stimulated, and similarly for the bundles of neurons transmitting signals further downstream in a parallel (and distributed) fashion. The sensory systems for both the infant and adult vary in lawlike and very similar ways with the external environment. It is what happens after this information is processed—a story involving learning—that determines what content is available for behavioral output. The adult believes the object is a flower and can act accordingly. The infant, however, lacks the appropriate beliefs, as she has not yet learned about flowers. Similarly, in a neural network, the information at the input level resembles sensory information. Only after learning can the network distinguish categories in the training set.\\n\\nIt is crucial to understand the difference between two types of physical properties in a neural network. The first type occurs when the units are activated, such as by the presentation of an $\\\\mathbf{F}$. This property occurs at a specific time, as electrical signals pass through the network upon such a presentation. Consider a network that has learned to recognize F\\'s. The input units will exhibit a characteristic activation pattern, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{I}$, corresponding to an $\\\\mathbf{F}$ when presented with one. Similarly, the output units exhibit a characteristic output pattern, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{O}$, upon such a presentation. Additionally, the hidden units exhibit an activation pattern after learning, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{H}$. The property $\\\\mathbf{H}$ exemplified by the hidden units differs from the (learned) final weight configuration, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{W}$. The former property $\\\\mathbf{H}$ is transient, occurring at a specific time, while the latter property is stable, persisting beyond the moment when electrical signals activate the network.\\n\\nAfter learning, the network\\'s hidden units may exhibit two types of properties, $\\\\mathbf{H}$ and $\\\\mathbf{W}$. These are analogous to the properties of real neurons in biological systems. A collection of neurons may fire in a particular manner, exhibiting a property analogous to an activation pattern $\\\\mathbf{H}$ in a neural network. A collection of neurons also possesses the relatively stable property of intersynaptic connections, analogous to the property $\\\\mathbf{W}$ in neural networks.\\n\\nWe know that after learning, the weight structure $\\\\mathbf{W}$ becomes a stable, permanent feature of a neural network. Since it is stable, it does not change with different incoming signals. It is not a property that is exemplified only when an input arrives; it persists over long periods, regardless of whether signals are incoming. As such, this is not the type of property we would typically associate with regularity, such as the regularity between the input units and external conditions $\\\\mathbf{F}$: When an $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is presented under the right conditions, a pattern $\\\\mathbf{I}$ will occur on the input units. As noted earlier, this is the type of regularity we usually associate with the transmission of information.\\n\\nAccording to Ramsey et al. (1991, pp. 215-217), neither the states $\\\\mathbf{H}$ nor $\\\\mathbf{W}$ in networks can be considered beliefs or memories. The activation pattern $\\\\mathbf{H}$ is unsuitable because it is transient, whereas beliefs are supposed to be enduring. For instance, John believes that kangaroos are marsupials even when he is not thinking about them. The weight structure $\\\\mathbf{W}$ is unsuitable because it is implausible that weights encode content in functionally discrete ways. It is unlikely that $\\\\mathbf{W}$ has discrete encoding properties corresponding to properties in the environment (or a training set). However, they acknowledge that there might be some system of encoding in the weights with which they are unfamiliar. They concede, \"Moreover, we concede that if such a covert system were discovered, then our argument would be seriously undermined\" (Ramsey et al. 1991, p. 215). We will return to this point later.\\n\\nSince neither activation patterns nor weight states meet Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s criteria for representational states such as beliefs or memories, there are no representational states in neural networks. They have been eliminated in the brave new world of connectionism. As I have mentioned before, while I am sympathetic, I remain unconvinced. In what follows, I propose how we should interpret belief in networks.',\n"," '\\\\section*{4 Belief in Networks}\\n\\nThe narrative of belief presented thus far is incomplete, as it overlooks the fact that beliefs can also be causes of output, manifesting as actions in agents or output patterns in networks. This is essential for establishing the third claim of propositional modularity regarding the causal role of beliefs. A belief must be a physical occurrence of an internal state at a specific time, capable of causing appropriate action at that moment. For instance, if I see a tree in front of me while running through the park, I swerve to avoid it because I believe the tree is there. However, this does not imply that I must maintain a constant belief in the tree\\'s presence. Such a notion seems implausible for perceptual beliefs. Instead, what is necessary are cognitive capacities for recognizing trees. A tree-recognition neural event—the actual occurrence at a given time—constitutes a belief. If this type of belief were constrained to fit the mold of \"enduring\" beliefs, I would perpetually swerve, which is not the case. Consider a neural network trained to recognize trees. Equipped with a digital camera front-end that feeds an input layer and an output layer connected to a speech synthesizer, it responds to trees only when one is presented, saying \"tree.\" Once trained, it does not continuously say \"tree\"—only when a tree is detected.\\n\\nI do not subscribe to the concept of belief-boxes or grandmother cells, which are hypothetical brain locations where specific propositional contents are stored. Such constructs are unnecessary for accommodating belief. With a causal notion of belief, believing $\\\\mathbf{F}$ involves encountering or perceiving $\\\\mathbf{F}$ under appropriate circumstances. In neural networks, these circumstances are presented with great simplicity, offering a powerful, mechanistic, and simplified model of brain activity under certain conditions.\\n\\nLearning provides the internal circumstances. In Skokowski (2004), I demonstrated how learning, involving actual physical interactions with the environment (or training set), establishes a weight state $\\\\mathbf{W}$ and determines its contents. These implicit contents are acquired naturally and play a genuine causal role in the network\\'s behavior.\\n\\nWithout learning, achieving the regularities associated with belief is impossible (beyond the information-carrying capacity of the input units). Without learning, one cannot produce outputs appropriate to the training task: yielding a \"1\" when given the proposition \"Cats have Fur,\" saying \"tree\" when presented with a tree, or swerving when encountering a tree on a run. Learning, by establishing an enduring weight state $\\\\mathbf{W}$, provides the necessary background conditions for an informational state, such as a perceptual or input state, to gain executive capacity and cause output (Skokowski 2004, pp. 367-368).\\n\\nBefore learning, an infant or a neural network may carry information about its surroundings, but neither possesses a belief that can guide behavioral output. The infant \"sees\" trees but does not recognize them or hold beliefs about them. The network \"sees\" trees in its input units but does not produce the sound \"tree\" in its output. Learning addresses this deficit, not by altering the input level. The input, or sensory, states continue to carry informational content in the same manner, covarying nomically with external conditions. What changes is the internal weight state or neural structure of the system. The causal work for an occurrent belief or memory is performed by the electrical signals in a neural network or the electro-chemical signals in the brain. This is the transient activation state. However, the background weight state $\\\\mathbf{W}$ modifies or guides the signal to produce output appropriate to the input. In this way, weights encode the latent ability to construct states corresponding to occurrent beliefs.\\n\\nBeliefs should cause output when they occur in an agent and should be caused by appropriate external conditions. Beliefs should carry representational content. In networks, belief should be seen as the activation pattern occurring in the input and hidden units after learning. This includes what I previously referred to as I, along with the hidden unit activation pattern $\\\\mathbf{H}$. Let us call this combined state $\\\\mathbf{B}$. It is crucial that $\\\\mathbf{B}$ is not present until after learning. Like the infant or the neural network, we lack cognitive abilities until we have learned them. Being presented with a tree before learning would not evoke a response appropriate to a belief about trees. However, after learning, $\\\\mathbf{B}$ causes appropriate output and is also caused by suitable external conditions. When presented with the proposition \"Cats have Fur,\" Network A registers input 1111000011110000 on its input layer, which in turn triggers further activation in the network. When perceiving a tree on a run, the adult swerves. $\\\\mathbf{B}$ also carries representational content, ensured by including the input activation $\\\\mathbf{I}$ as part of $\\\\mathbf{B}$. Through sensory covariation with environmental properties, $\\\\mathbf{I}$ carries content, and thus $\\\\mathbf{B}$ does by default.',\n"," '\\\\section*{5 Interpreting States}\\n\\nPreviously, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon dismissed the idea that the weights $\\\\mathbf{W}$ of a neural network could encode content, acknowledging that such encoding would significantly undermine their argument. However, clustering techniques like principal components analysis (PCA) have long been used to explore weight space and have successfully identified correlations between weight space properties and the characteristics of the training set or environment being learned. Notably, studies on language tasks by Elman (1990, 1991) and Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1987) demonstrate that weight space is indeed partitioned after learning. For instance, Elman (1990) utilized clustering to reveal a partitioning of state space corresponding to lexical and grammatical categories learned during a word-prediction task. He also employed PCA to identify encodings of distinctions between verbs and nouns, marking the number of main clause subjects, and other \"internal representations\" (Elman 1991, p. 13). Furthermore, Skokowski (2004) provides a philosophical perspective on the content carried in the weights of a trained network. He argues that when a learning history selects a weight state $\\\\mathbf{W}$, it determines a function for that state, thereby meeting the conditions for $\\\\mathbf{W}$ to carry content about its causes and thus implementing an implicit belief: \"As a result ... W becomes a stable, enduring part of an agent, carries content, and acts as a background condition allowing behavior to be caused under the right external conditions\" (Skokowski 2004, p. 377).\\n\\nThe point I wish to emphasize is that, contrary to the claims of Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, it now seems that trained networks can encode content both within activations, $\\\\mathbf{I}$ and $\\\\mathbf{H}$, and within their weights $\\\\mathbf{W}$. The implication is that in a trained network, we can identify discrete states, which I have termed B, that, in conjunction with the (trained) weight state $\\\\mathbf{W}$, are semantically interpretable and play a causal role in certain cognitive episodes but not others. It appears we have indeed found an excellent candidate for belief in networks. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon might argue that while this model might work for occurrent propositions, it would not apply to general propositions such as \"cats have fur.\" However, this would be premature. Rumelhart and Todd (1993) have demonstrated how general propositions can be encoded by networks through a training history. Their model is similar in spirit to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s Networks A and B. General propositions such as \"a robin is a bird\" were used to train a network so that given \"Robin is a\" as input, the network produced \"bird\" as output. There is no general proposition \"a robin is a bird\" stored anywhere in the network. Instead, it is the connection weights $\\\\mathbf{W}$ that play the causal role in producing the output. As in the case described above, an implicit belief can be attributed to the network, as a learning history has assigned a function to the weights; in this case, the function to produce a general proposition, such as \"a robin is a bird\" or \"kangaroos are marsupials,\" given appropriate inputs. Contrary to the objection, then, this model will also work for general propositions, where, as above, a (trained) weight state $\\\\mathbf{W}$ is semantically interpretable and plays a causal role in some cognitive episodes but not others.',\n"," '\\\\section*{6 Missing the Point: The Requirements of Wetware}\\n\\nWe can now revisit the literature on Ramsey, Stich, and Garon mentioned at the beginning of this article to understand why various approaches fall short. O\\'Brien (1991) advocates for a broad causal holism regarding belief in connectionist networks, a holism that denies what he terms \"causal discreteness.\" According to O\\'Brien, causal discreteness requires that distinct causal roles be identifiable for the various representational elements in a system, which he argues is implausible for connectionist networks. However, the approach presented in this paper provides distinct causal roles for the representational elements $\\\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\\\mathbf{W}$. Furthermore, the contents of these states can be determined: explicit occurrent contents for states like $\\\\mathbf{B}$ and, following Skokowski (2004), implicit enduring contents for states like $\\\\mathbf{W}$. Both types of states are necessary for particular actions of a network to which we attribute \"beliefs.\"\\n\\nStich\\'s (1991) response to O\\'Brien rejects the broad causal holism endorsed by O\\'Brien, arguing that not every belief encoded in a distributed system plays a role in every processing episode. I concur with this view for the reasons previously mentioned: the relevant covariational and encoded contents for particular states $\\\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\\\mathbf{W}$ are crucial for a specific episode, and these contents correspond to folk psychological explanations.\\n\\nForster and Seidel (1994) propose a simple network model that they claim demonstrates propositional modularity for a concrete distributed system for both occurrent and enduring belief states, thereby challenging Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s views on this property concerning networks. Although I sympathize with Forster and Seidel\\'s objectives, I must agree with Ramsey\\'s (1994) critique: the model is too simplistic to be broadly applicable. The encodings offered by this six-node model are localist in nature, making it challenging to generalize this simple model to massively distributed systems, including, most importantly, wetware.\\n\\nClark (1995) offers a different approach from O\\'Brien, Forster, and Seidel by placing the representational burden of networks entirely on the weight matrix: \"Connectionist systems thus encode knowledge as complex patterns of positive and negative weights linking up simple processing units\" (Clark 1995, p. 342). As emphasized in this article, this approach overlooks the direct covariational component of the input states, which carry informational content about external conditions. A robust biological neural model of cognition must include the role of the senses in contributing to occurrent beliefs, something lacking when the entire burden of content storage is placed on enduring weight states.\\n\\nStich and Warfield\\'s response accuses Clark of neo-behaviorism, arguing that any black box would satisfy Clark\\'s dispositional account of enduring belief encoded in a weight matrix $\\\\mathbf{W}$ (Stich and Warfield 1995, p. 403). However, this objection would not apply to an account like the one provided in Skokowski (2004) for the contents of weight states. This account requires an internal, physical state $\\\\mathbf{W}$ installed by learning, meaning a causally efficacious learning history. Such an approach fulfills another requirement of Stich and Warfield: to avoid eliminativism, connectionism must provide a causal/historical account when determining the contents of these states. This is precisely what Skokowski\\'s (2004) model accomplishes. Finally, Stich and Warfield still align with Ramsey, Stich, and Garon in asserting that if connectionist theories are correct, then eliminativism will be correct about propositional attitudes (Stich and Warfield 1995, p. 409). This paper is dedicated to overturning that view.\\n\\nA common issue with all these unsuccessful approaches is their lack of attention to the requirements of wetware. An essential aspect of biological connectionist systems is that most occurrent beliefs are linked with the senses, and learned behavior requires the establishment of neural connections through interactions with the environment. Both types of representational states—occurrent (activations) and connections (weights)—play a role in behavior and can be determined: occurrent states by being activated through covariation with the immediate environment, and connections through their actual and efficacious learning history. By understanding the origins of these states, we can see how individual combinations have a causal role in some episodes but not in others. This understanding gives us confidence in ascribing belief to networks.',\n"," '\\\\section{I}\\n\\nEliminativism regarding folk psychology is often presented in two ways: as the claim that beliefs and desires do not exist, or as the claim that belief-desire ascriptions are not true. Let\\'s refer to the first as \\'ontological eliminativism\\' and the second as \\'truth-theoretic eliminativism\\'. These two forms of eliminativism are not generally equivalent. While truth-theoretic eliminativism implies ontological eliminativism, the reverse is not necessarily true. For instance, many people are ontological eliminativists about holes and shadows, meaning they believe these do not exist as entities, yet they are not truth-theoretic eliminativists, as they accept that many statements about holes and shadows are true. This presents an apparent problem: how can we consider such statements true while denying the existence of holes and shadows? The solution is well-known: we interpret talk about holes and shadows as idiomatic, not as literal claims about the existence of such entities. This allows us to reconcile such talk with ontological eliminativism by reinterpreting it in terms of entities that are uncontroversial.\\n\\nNow, consider someone who favors a dispositionalist view of beliefs and desires. This person might acknowledge the existence of beliefs and desires by identifying them with dispositions, which they argue do exist. However, they might also lean towards ontological eliminativism, asserting that \\'behavioral dispositions\\' should not be considered existing entities. Instead, having a behavioral disposition means that a certain counterfactual conditional is true of you, not that you possess something that merits the label \"disposition.\"\\n\\nDespite this, they might still maintain that belief-desire talk is true. In this view, beliefs and desires would be more akin to shadows than to mythical creatures like mermaids. I am not suggesting that this approach to beliefs and desires is necessarily correct; rather, it serves to illustrate how ontological and truth-theoretic eliminativism about folk psychology can diverge.\\n\\nA dispositionalist of this kind would not satisfy an eliminativist as found in the philosophy of mind literature. This type of eliminativism not only denies the ontological status of beliefs and desires but also suggests that belief-desire ascriptions are not true. Even when eliminativism is described as a view about what exists, it is often the truth-theoretic version that is intended. For example, while Ramsey, Stich, and Garon describe eliminativism as a thesis about existence, they explain its purpose as equating folk psychology with discredited theories like witchcraft and phlogiston. Clearly, only truth-theoretic eliminativism can justify such a comparison.\\n\\nIn summary, truth-theoretic eliminativism poses the real challenge to our discussions about beliefs and desires. If we could preserve the truth of such discussions without considering beliefs and desires as entities, folk psychology would be in a much stronger position than failed scientific theories and myths. Therefore, if eliminativism is to be a significant threat, it should focus on truth-theoretic eliminativism.',\n"," '\\\\section{II}\\n\\nWithout explicitly acknowledging it, and perhaps without realizing it, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s argument regarding the threat of eliminativism employs a theme central to Donald Davidson\\'s work. Davidson famously argued that reasons must be treated as causes to distinguish between reasons that rationalize an action and those that explain it. He pointed out that there are many instances where an individual performs an action and possesses a belief-desire pair that rationalizes the action, yet it would be inappropriate to use that pair to explain the action. In \"Psychology as Philosophy\" (1980), Davidson writes:\\n\\n\"A desire and a belief of the right sort may explain an action, but not necessarily. A man might have good reason for killing his father, and he might do it, and yet the reasons not be his reasons in doing it (think of Oedipus). So when we offer the fact of the desire and the belief in explanation, we imply not only that the agent had the desire and belief, but that they were efficacious in producing the action\" (p. 223).\\n\\nSimilarly, in defending the thesis that beliefs and desires are \\'causally active,\\' Ramsey, Stich, and Garon write:\\n\\n\"In common sense psychology, behavior is often explained by appeal to certain of the agent\\'s beliefs and desires. Thus, to explain why Alice went to her office, we might note that she wanted to send some e-mail messages (and, of course, she believed she could do so from her office). However, in some cases, an agent will have several sets of beliefs and desires, each of which might lead to the same behavior. Thus we may suppose that Alice also wanted to talk to her research assistant, and that she believed he would be at the office. In such cases, common sense psychology assumes that Alice\\'s going to her office might have been caused by either one of the belief-desire pairs, or by both, and that determining which of these options obtains is an empirical matter. So it is entirely possible that on this occasion Alice\\'s desire to send some e-mail played no role in producing her behavior; it was the desire to talk with her research assistant that actually caused her to go to the office. However, had she not wanted to talk with her research assistant, she might have gone to the office anyhow, because the desire to send some e-mail, which was causally inert in her actual decision making, might then have become actively involved. Note that in this case, common sense psychology is prepared to recognize a pair of quite distinct semantically characterized states, one of which may be causally active while the other not\" (p. 505).\\n\\nAs we shall see later, while the thrust of the argument is similar to Davidson\\'s, the case described poses a sterner challenge to those who wish to deny that folk psychology is committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires than the one Davidson had in mind. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon also usefully develop Davidson\\'s idea by extending it to cover cases where we distinguish between a belief that rationalizes another belief and a belief that explains why another belief was formed:\\n\\n\"On the common sense view, it may sometimes happen that a person has a number of belief clusters, any one of which might lead him to infer some further belief. When he actually does draw the inference, folk psychology assumes that it is an empirical question what he inferred it from, and that this question typically has a determinate answer. Suppose, for example, that Inspector Clouseau believes that the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel, and that he said he arrived back on the morning train. Suppose Clouseau also believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, and that the morning train has been taken out of service. Given these beliefs, along with some widely shared background beliefs, Clouseau might well infer that the butler is lying. If he does, folk psychology presumes that the inference might be based either on his beliefs about the hotel, or on his beliefs about the train, or both. It is entirely possible, from the perspective of common sense psychology, that although Clouseau has long known that the hotel is closed for the season, this belief played no role in his inference on this particular occasion. Once again, we see common sense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert\" (p. 506).\\n\\nThey conclude that folk psychology is committed to the thesis that beliefs and desires are causally active. Let us clarify this claim a little on the authors\\' behalf. Folk psychology does not pretend that one\\'s beliefs and desires are always causally active. Indeed, in the last sentence of the quoted passage above, the authors describe one that is causally inert. What is central to their argument, I think, is the idea that insofar as common sense psychology uses a particular attitude to explain another attitude or action, it is committed to the causal efficacy of that attitude. The explanatory role of folk psychology, then, involves, on their account, a commitment to causally active attitudes.\\n\\nRamsey, Stich, and Garon further contend that according to folk psychology, propositional attitudes are functionally discrete; that is, it is always possible for a person to acquire or lose particular propositional attitudes without disturbing the rest. There is no attitude you have that couldn\\'t be lost singly. Moreover, for any attitude that, given your set of attitudes, it is possible for you to acquire, you could acquire it without losing any of the original set. They also add to their list of folk psychological commitments the platitude that beliefs and desires have semantic properties.\\n\\nThe authors then articulate a type of psychological model that is being taken seriously in contemporary cognitive science, which poses a problem for these three folk psychological commitments, considered together. When one looks at the type of psychological architecture these models describe, it doesn\\'t appear as if there are any functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties that correspond to ordinary belief-desire ascriptions. They concede that we might have been too hasty in drawing this conclusion about those models, that there might be \"some covert functionally discrete system of propositional encoding that has yet to be discovered\" (p. 517) in these cognitive architectures, but argue that the burden of argument is on anyone who reckons this likely. For the purposes of this paper, I need not delve into the details of the class of so-called \\'connectionist\\' models that Ramsey, Stich, and Garon describe, since their details are irrelevant to the points I wish to make.\\n\\nIt is clear where they go from here: There is a type of psychological model which may very well be true of us, but which doesn\\'t make room for functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties that correspond to common-sense belief-desire ascriptions. Therefore, it may very well be true that we have no functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties that correspond to belief-desire ascription. Folk psychology is committed to the view that beliefs and desires are functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties. Therefore, it may very well be true of us that we have no beliefs and desires. For the reason discussed earlier, this conclusion is to be read as not merely the ontological conclusion that beliefs and desires don\\'t exist, but as making the stronger claim that belief-desire ascriptions are not true of us.\\n\\nNow for the refinement. There is a fairly obvious problem for the Davidsonian argument from the need to distinguish rationalizers and explainers to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires. The point is simple. We don\\'t need to recognize the causal efficacy of both beliefs and desires to distinguish between explainers and rationalizers. Let me explain. Suppose we concede to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon that beliefs are causally active states but choose to construe desires in a dispositional way. Desires, on this view, would be evidenced by how beliefs cause behavior but would not be realized themselves by some causally active, functionally discrete states.\\n\\nCould such an account distinguish between explainers and mere rationalizers? It could very easily. The prima facie problem here is how to distinguish between desires that explain and desires that rationalize. A moment\\'s reflection here reveals the problem to be no more than prima facie. Thinking back to the case that Ramsey, Stich, and Garon describe, suppose Alice\\'s belief that she could get e-mail messages sent by going to her office was causally responsible for her going to her office, but that her belief that she could talk to her research assistant by going to her office was causally inert. That would license our concluding that it was her desire to send e-mail messages rather than her desire to talk to her research assistant that explains her going to her office, even if there were no isolable, causally active states in her that were identifiable as her desires. In short, one who opts for a dispositionalist account of desires could ground the difference between desires that explain and those that do not in terms of which means/end beliefs are causally active.\\n\\nOf course, we have not yet disarmed the eliminativist in any serious way. The story I have just told requires that there are, at least, some causally active states that deserve the label \\'belief.\\' The thrust of Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s paper is that it may well turn out that none of our causally active states deserve being called either beliefs or desires. So even if folk psychology is only committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs, their argument for the threat of eliminativism might yet go through. So we can restate the first premise of the argument as: According to folk psychology, beliefs are causally efficacious, semantically evaluable states that are functionally discrete, and an agent has desires only if she has beliefs.\\n\\nWhile having my doubts about folk psychology\\'s commitment to functional discreteness, I shall, for the purposes of this paper, concede to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon that it is so committed. Further, I shall concede that the type of psychological model that they describe may well be true of us and further, that if it is true of us, then we have no causally efficacious states that can be plausibly regarded as being beliefs or desires. The strand of their argumentation that I wish to focus on concerns the claim that folk psychology is committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires and its use as a basis for inferring that eliminativism is a serious threat.',\n"," '\\\\section{IV}\\n\\nLet\\'s assume we are well-positioned to justify the first two premises of our original argument. Suppose folk psychology is committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires, and science may eventually discover that none of our causally efficacious states should be considered propositional attitudes. How justified would we be in concluding that all belief-desire ascriptions are false?\\n\\nImagine we determine that folk psychology insists on the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires because it claims we can distinguish between explainers and mere rationalizers, even to the extent of differentiating cases of overdetermination from those of late preemption. Further, suppose science finds no causally efficacious states that qualify as beliefs and desires. Why conclude that belief-desire ascriptions are false? Why not instead conclude that folk psychology is mistaken in insisting on a distinction between beliefs that overdetermine and those that are late preemptors? Generally, when folk psychology claims beliefs are F and science finds nothing that could be both a belief and F, there are two possible conclusions: one might conclude there are no beliefs, or one might conclude folk psychology is wrong to say beliefs are F. Clearly, the argument is not deductively valid. But is the conclusion at least reasonable? In what follows, I will offer a few reasons for thinking it isn\\'t.\\n\\nLike many others, I am drawn to a Moorean approach to belief revision. Some views form the core of common sense and are more obviously true than those that do not. When choosing how to distribute error, Moore (1925) suggests we ascribe error to views that don\\'t form the core of common sense. It seems reasonable to blame less obviously correct views when our theories go astray. Generally, when faced with a choice like the one posed in the last paragraph, the Moorean will be inclined to assign error not to the claim that there are beliefs, but to the constraint folk psychology places on beliefs. After all, the claim that we can intelligibly distinguish cases of late preemption from overdetermination, even if it belongs to common sense psychology, is far less obvious than the claim that there are beliefs. Here\\'s an analogy: Folk physics is, in some respects, incorrect about the constraints governing physical objects. However, we don\\'t conclude that folk physics is wrong to claim there are physical objects. Instead, we conclude it is wrong about the constraints governing them.\\n\\nLycan (1988) has expressed a similar conclusion:\\n\\n\"I am entirely willing to give up fairly large chunks of our commonsensical or platitudinous theory of belief or of desire (or of almost anything else) and decide that we were just wrong about a lot of things, without drawing the inference that we are no longer talking about belief or desire.\" (pp. 31-32)\\n\\nLycan defends this view by employing a general semantic account of theoretical terms that is causal-historical rather than functionalist: \"I incline away from Lewis\\'s Carnapian and/or Rylean cluster theory of the reference of theoretical terms, and towards Putnam\\'s causal-historical theory\" (p. 32). However, it\\'s important to note that the Moorean need not defend his belief that people believe things in this way. The Moorean believes such a belief needs no defense: it is rendered epistemically legitimate by its place in the core of common sense. We don\\'t need a semantic theory to defend it; we merely need to ensure we don\\'t embrace a semantic theory that conflicts with it. One such semantic theory is the one Lycan describes, but it is not the only one. The Moorean might instead embrace a mixed theory, understanding some theoretical terms in a more causal-historical way, others in a more functionalist way. He might embrace other general semantic principles or remain agnostic about whether there are any general semantic principles about what it takes for a term to refer. This is relevant to Stich\\'s recent (1992) criticism of Lycan\\'s view:\\n\\n\"On Lycan\\'s view, it is hard to see how anything could show that the posits of folk psychology are not part of the ontology of a given branch of cognitive science. Indeed, on Lycan\\'s view, it is far from clear why we should not say that phlogiston really does exist. It\\'s the stuff we now call \\'oxygen,\\' and earlier theorists were \\'just wrong about a lot of things.\\'\" (p. 256)\\n\\nThere are a few points of interest raised here, which I will address from a Moorean perspective. First, let\\'s address the point that on Lycan\\'s view, nothing will show that no one believes anything. This is true enough. But is it a problem? The Moorean will insist nothing should persuade us that the claim \\'People believe things\\' is false: the premises of any such argument, he will say, will always be less obvious than the claim that people believe things. Yet he will hardly see this as problematic. The purported virtue of the Moorean approach is precisely that it recognizes that nothing could show the core of common sense to be false. (Unlike Stich, I have framed the issue here in terms of truth rather than what exists, for reasons given earlier.) Second, Stich points out that Lycan will have trouble explaining why phlogiston doesn\\'t exist. But this is a consequence of the causal-historical theory he embraces, which, as we have seen, is not a theory the Moorean need be committed to as a general account of theoretical terms. As it stands, the Moorean view hardly encourages us to say that nothing could show that phlogiston doesn\\'t exist. For a belief in phlogiston isn\\'t part of the core of common sense. There is thus nothing to stop a Moorean from thinking it more likely that phlogiston doesn\\'t exist than that phlogiston is identical to oxygen.\\n\\nI now turn to a different problem with the inference from (1) and (2) to (C). Stich is right that for the argument for eliminativism to gain traction, we need a strong attachment to the idea that theoretical terms such as \\'belief\\' are (at least in part) functionally defined. That is to say, the truth conditions for \\'There are beliefs\\' are given by the constraints on beliefs found in folk psychology. In the remainder of this paper, I want to indicate why, even if we are attracted to that sort of view, we may yet have good reason to consider the threat of eliminativism to be very slim.\\n\\nTo begin, it is worth reminding ourselves of what the leading contemporary proponent of functionalist definitions of theoretical terms actually says about cases where the functional constraints fail to be satisfied. I want to turn here to Lewis\\' \\'How to Define Theoretical Terms\\' (1983b). The Ramsey sentence of a theory, he explains, is what you get when you conjoin the sentences of a theory, turn the theoretical terms of a theory into names, replace the theoretical terms by variables, using a different variable for each different theoretical term, and prefix the result with a string of existential quantifiers, one for each variable. He considers a case where nothing in the world satisfies the variables of the Ramsey sentence, that is, cases where the Ramsey sentence is false. Do we then want to conclude that the theoretical terms of the theory from which the Ramsey sentence is derived fail to pick out any entities or properties? Concerning this suggestion, Lewis writes:\\n\\n\"That will do very well, at least in the case of a theory like phlogiston theory which comes nowhere near being realized. It will not do so well in the case of unrealized theory with a (unique) near realization: that is, an n-tuple that does not realize the original theory, but does realize some theory obtained from it by a slight weakening or a slight correction.\" (p. 83)\\n\\nLewis wishes to concede, then, that when some slightly weakened or corrected version of a theory is realized, in that the Ramsey sentence of the weakened or corrected theory is true, then the theoretical terms of the original theory ought to be taken as referring. If that is right, then even if one is drawn to Lewis\\' approach to theoretical terms, one should be wary of inferring that a theoretical term \\'t\\' fails to refer just because the theory places a constraint on t\\'s that nothing in the world can satisfy. What one will have to do, further, is to show that there is not even a near-realization of that theory. In the case of folk psychology, then, to show that belief-desire ascriptions weren\\'t true, one would have to show not only that folk psychology says something about beliefs and desires that nothing in the world satisfied, but moreover, that there is no near-realization of folk psychology. If we could modify folk psychology in a way that preserves most of its original theoretical content but in a way that the Ramsey sentence of the revised theory was true, then, on Lewis\\' account, we should take the theoretical terms of folk psychology, as originally stated, as referring.\\n\\nThis all provides us with an interesting way of viewing so-called behavioristic analyses of folk psychology. It may be that the opponents of philosophical behaviorism are right to claim that no behavioristic account can provide an adequate analysis of folk psychology, that there are some strands of folk psychology that can find no home in a behavioristic construal of that theory. Nevertheless, I suggest that the bulk of folk psychological theory may well be understandable in a behavioristic way.\\n\\nI hope that my reflections in section III went some way towards convincing the reader of this. (Remember here that behavioristic approaches to folk psychology include not only supervenient behaviorism but also offshoots of the sort described earlier.) These so-called \\'analyses\\' may then be able to provide a bulwark against eliminativism without really being analyses at all. Instead of construing our best behavioristic account of folk psychology as an analysis, we may do well to view it as describing a near-realization of folk psychology. We could then reason as follows: Perhaps folk psychology is not realized. Still, we can rest assured that there is a near-realization of folk psychology. All it takes for the theoretical terms of folk psychology to express some genuine properties and relations is for there to be a near-realization. Hence we can rest assured that the theoretical terms of folk psychology are not denotationless.\\n\\nIf what I have said above is correct, then we can conclude that, in general, discoveries about the intrinsic architecture of the brain are not going to threaten the legitimacy of belief-desire ascriptions. For it is well known that behavioristic psychologies are virtually immune to discoveries about internal architecture. If a psychology of that sort can provide a near-realization of folk psychology, then folk psychology will turn out to be immune to such discoveries too.\\n\\nTo sum up, we have seen that Ramsey, Stich, and Garon (and, indeed, Davidson) fail to argue successfully for the claim that folk psychology is committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires. We have seen, moreover, that their attempt to use that claim to secure the threat of eliminativism is altogether illegitimate. It seems, then, that the threat of eliminativism is a good deal less serious than their paper would have us believe.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Horses of a Different Color?}\\n\\nOne of the iconic scenes in the film \"The Wizard of Oz\" features a horse whose coat changes from green to pink, then to blue, and finally to yellow. When Dorothy expresses her surprise, the Wizard explains, \"That\\'s a horse of a different color!\" However, his explanation is misleading. Much like the magical activities in the Palace, this horse in the Emerald City is a bit of a trick. In the real world, \"a horse of a different color\" is a phrase used to distinguish one thing from another entirely different thing, like chalk and cheese. Yet, the horse in the film is visibly the same, merely changing color as it moves along. The transformation is not one of substance but rather an effect of the lighting.\\n\\nStaying within the realm of Hollywood, imagine a film allegory depicting \"The Story of AI.\" The narrative must capture the evolution of AI theories over the years. Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI; Haugeland, 1985) and connectionism must certainly be represented. But should they be portrayed as two distinct characters, or as a single character shown in different lights? Perhaps neither: a casting director with a keen understanding of AI literature might hire several actors to play contrasting \"connectionist\" roles, including a current pop star as parallel distributed processing (PDP). If cast as two characters, should they share the camaraderie of Newman and Redford, or endure unrelenting antagonism? And if antagonism is the theme, which is the hero and which is the anti-hero? Which is Tom, and which is Jerry?\\n\\nIn essence, what is the relationship between GOFAI and connectionism? Are they, as some claim, two distinct paradigms? Are they \"False Starts and Real Foundations,\" as suggested by the subtitle of a recent collection of essays on AI (Graubard, 1988)? Or are they complementary partners in a shared intellectual endeavor? If cooperation is the focus, are they strange bedfellows who will never find true harmony? Or are they siblings with common intellectual roots, separated in childhood but destined for a reunion? (Prepare your tissues for the happy ending.)',\n"," '**Differences Between GOFAI and Connectionism**\\n\\nThe debate between GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and connectionism often centers around their distinct approaches, commonly referred to as the symbolic paradigm and the subsymbolic paradigm. These terms highlight two primary differences: what is computed and how it is computed.\\n\\nPaul Smolensky (1987, 1988) noted that many connectionist systems compute \"meanings\" that do not directly correspond to everyday concepts. These systems do not encode features as single words or familiar phrases, nor do they represent the \"thoughts\" of folk psychology. Instead, each unit represents a microfeature, which, when combined, may correspond to a recognizable idea, though individually, they may be difficult to interpret. For example, in a system modeling stereopsis, no single unit computes the depth of an object. Instead, each unit compares light falling on corresponding points on the two retinas. In contrast, many GOFAI models, such as \"expert systems,\" compute inferential relations between recognizable concepts or entire propositions (e.g., \"patient has red spots\" implies \"patient has measles\").\\n\\nThe method of computing depth in connectionist models differs from GOFAI models. Features like depth, symbolized by ordinary language and contributing to everyday thoughts, are represented by the overall activity pattern of the network. As the network performs its computations in parallel, this pattern evolves until the system reaches a stable state that represents the concept or judgment in question. In a stereoptic system, the distance of the viewed object is represented by the equilibrium activity pattern of all point comparisons. This process is described by differential equations, unlike the symbol-manipulating instructions used in GOFAI.\\n\\nThe subsymbolic paradigm is exemplified by the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) approach, which has garnered significant attention and curiosity due to its distinct nature from GOFAI (Clark, 1989, 1990). However, PDP is just one of many connectionist approaches.\\n\\nConnectionist models are broadly inspired by neural networks in the brain, involving parallel-processing systems with cooperative computations based on local interactions between units. Despite this general description, there are many variations in connectionist models.\\n\\nEach computation in connectionist systems is relatively simple compared to a LISP instruction in a von Neumann machine. Connectionist units and computations vary in semantic interpretation and function. Some units represent truth values of complex propositional expressions, others encode familiar concepts, and some stand for microfeatures at a more detailed level than everyday concepts. Only the latter can be termed subsymbolic.\\n\\nPDP models vary in learning rules and basic functioning. For instance, unit activity may be binary or continuous, deterministic or stochastic, and based on a wide or narrow range of evidence. These distinctions are mirrored in the nervous system. It was discovered in the 1950s that neurons sometimes fire spontaneously, contrary to the Sherringtonian view (Burns, 1968). This unpredictable behavior may be advantageous, rather than a flaw in evolutionary design.\\n\\nIn summary, all connectionist systems compute differently from von Neumann machines, and some, like PDP systems, involve basic units that compute in ways unfamiliar to folk psychology.\\n\\nWhether GOFAI and connectionism are entirely distinct paradigms or rivals in understanding the mind remains an open question.',\n"," '# The Origins of Connectionism\\n\\nWhile GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) was largely inspired by the belief that mental processes might be akin to the information processes occurring in von Neumann computers, connectionism took a different path. Donald Norman (1986) noted that PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing) models cannot be interpreted as stemming from our metaphor of the modern computer. He stated, \"Here, we are talking about a new form of computation, one clearly based upon principles that have heretofore not had any counterpart in computers\" (p. 534).\\n\\nNorman described these computations as \"neurologically inspired,\" citing Frank Rosenblatt\\'s (1962) perceptrons and Stephen Grossberg\\'s (1982) mathematical analyses of brain function as significant precursors. Indeed, they were, but equally important was the seminal work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943). Their paper, \"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity,\" demonstrated that networks of simple computational units could, in principle, perform highly complex computations.\\n\\nMcCulloch and Pitts proved that every function of propositional logic is realizable by some (fairly simple) network of all-or-none threshold units, and that every Turing-computable function can be computed by such a network. They also suggested that learning and other psychological phenomena could be achieved by neural networks. They claimed that the entirety of psychology—\"all that could be achieved in that field\"—boils down to specifying networks capable of various computations. As they put it, \"If our nets are undefined, our facts are undefined.\" They believed that action, perception, reasoning, introspection, motivation, and value judgment could one day be understood, as mental processes are theoretically tractable because they are physically realizable in intelligible ways. Even in psychiatry, \"\\'Mind\\' no longer goes \\'more ghostly than a ghost.\\'\"\\n\\nMcCulloch and Pitts\\' conviction that the mind can be understood in computational terms was comparable to the insight that biology can be based on chemistry. This insight, not the discovery of the genetic code (which led to the \"new\" science of molecular biology), was the truly revolutionary moment in biology. Similarly, McCulloch and Pitts made it possible to explore how mental processes can be understood as computations of various kinds.\\n\\nTheir equation of thinking with computation inspired early work in connectionist modeling. Some of this pioneering research was also influenced by their later work (Pitts & McCulloch, 1947), where they argued that a neurophysiologically realistic theory must qualify their earlier claim (from 1943) that \"the fundamental relations [in psychology] are those of two-valued logic\" (p. 38).\\n\\nIn principle, this claim remained true: Anything computable can be computed by some network of the type they defined. (Even in practice, it holds some weight: Most connectionist models, so far, are simulated on von Neumann machines.) However, an anatomically plausible theory of mental processes (as opposed to an \"existence proof\" of its physical realizability) cannot assume such neat and tidy connections, nor such consistently reliable thresholds, as posited in their earlier paper. Cerebral networks, unlike logic circuits, cannot be tailor-made or rigid in every detail. As they put it:\\n\\n\"It is wise to construct these nets so that their principal function is little perturbed by small perturbations in excitation, threshold, or details of connection within the same neighborhood. Genes can only predetermine statistical order, and original chaos must reign over nets that learn, for learning builds new order according to a law of use\" (p. 46).\\n\\nIn light of present-day concerns, it is interesting to note that Pitts and McCulloch\\'s 1947 paper developed a processing theory (of the visual reflex that controls the direction of gaze) in statistical terms. The theory focused on identifying \"weighted centers of gravity\" of neural activity. They located this activity in anatomically specified groups of cells in the superior colliculus, arguing that these cells functioned as spatial maps of the visual input. In rebutting both Gestalt theories of brain-world isomorphism and what would now be called \"grandmother-cell\" neurological theories, they insisted: \"That language in which information is communicated to the homunculus who sits always beyond any incomplete analysis of sensory mechanisms and before any analysis of motor ones neither needs to be nor is apt to be built on the plan of those languages men use toward one another\" (p. 56).\\n\\nMcCulloch and Pitts were not the first to claim that \"learning builds new order [in the brain] according to a law of use\" (p. 46). This was a common tenet of late British empiricism; in the mid-18th century, David Hartley explained sensory and motor learning in terms of the association of \"medullary particles\" and \"vibratiuncles\" in the brain. Over a century later, William James suggested that the activation of one brain cell by another increases the probability of such activation in the future due to some physiological change at the synapse. However, McCulloch and Pitts\\' logical proof that computations of indefinite complexity could be realized in nervous networks, and their mathematical definitions of neural functioning, inspired Donald Hebb to cast James\\' suggestion in more precise terms (Hebb, 1949).\\n\\nHebb\\'s account of synaptic modification (which he described as \"a form of connectionism\") is the basis of most learning rules used in today\\'s connectionist systems. Anyone who had a penny for every reference in the current literature to \"Hebbian\" rules would be wealthy indeed. At the outset of \"The Organization of Behavior,\" Hebb commended McCulloch and Pitts\\' application of mathematics to the interaction of populations of neurons (and he also drew on McCulloch\\'s neurophysiological work, arguing for the empirical plausibility of his learning rule). In short, behind Hebb, McCulloch and Pitts are ever-present.\\n\\nSo what? Surely, Norman\\'s attempt to dissociate connectionism from GOFAI still stands? Identifying another historical precursor, even earlier than those he mentioned, does not argue against him. Even McCulloch and Pitts theorized in a connectionist fashion when they had real brains in mind.\\n\\nGranted. But the crucial point is that the McCulloch and Pitts paper of 1943 was just as much a precursor of GOFAI as it was of connectionism.',\n"," '# The Dual Role of McCulloch and Pitts\\n\\nThe preceding statement should not be surprising. McCulloch and Pitts\\' paper on the logical activity inherent in neural networks is often seen as more closely associated with GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) than with connectionism.\\n\\nFor example, Rosenblatt (1958) criticized the paper 15 years later for inspiring \"a profusion of brain models which amount simply to logical contrivances for performing particular algorithms... in response to sequences of stimuli.\" He acknowledged that McCulloch and Pitts were \"chiefly concerned with the question of how [psychological functions] might be achieved by a deterministic physical system of any sort, rather than how this is actually done by the brain.\" However, he rejected their implicit assumption that understanding a more realistic nervous system would require \"only a refinement or modification of existing [logical] principles.\" A fundamentally different approach was needed. Ignoring McCulloch and Pitts\\' 1947 paper, Rosenblatt stated:\\n\\nA relatively small number of theorists, like Ashby and von Neumann, have focused on how an imperfect neural network, with many random connections, can reliably perform functions represented by idealized wiring diagrams. Unfortunately, the language of symbolic logic and Boolean algebra is less suited [than a statistical theory] for such investigations.\\n\\nEarly computer research concentrated on number crunching, without considering the logical functions that might be instantiated in the brain. The use of computers during the war effort was more relevant at the time. However, the potential relevance of McCulloch and Pitts\\' work for modeling thinking in general was soon recognized.\\n\\nNorbert Wiener, for instance, recounted a conversation with Pitts in 1943:\\nAt that time, Mr. Pitts was already well-versed in mathematical logic and neurophysiology but had limited engineering contacts. He was unfamiliar with Dr. Shannon\\'s work and had little experience with electronics. He was very interested when I showed him examples of modern vacuum tubes and explained that these were ideal for realizing his neuronic circuits and systems in metal. From that point, it became clear to us that the ultrarapid computing machine, relying on consecutive switching devices, must represent an almost ideal model of the problems arising in the nervous system. The all-or-none nature of neuron discharge is precisely analogous to the binary choice in determining a digit, which several of us had already considered the most satisfactory basis for computing machine design. (Wiener, 1948, p. 14)\\n\\nRegarding \"computing-machine design,\" the architecture of the electronic digital computer itself was influenced by McCulloch and Pitts\\' ideas. Their neural-net specifications of logical functions (such as AND, OR, and NOT) were embodied in electronic circuitry as and-gates, or-gates, and the like. This embodiment effectively transformed computers from mere number crunchers into general-purpose symbol-manipulating machines.\\n\\nJohn von Neumann (1945) referred to them several times in an early report on computer design, commending their idea that neurons—or basic computational units—could be thought of as digital elements. He stated:\\n\\nEvery digital computing device contains certain relay-like elements, with discrete equilibria. Such an element has two or more distinct states in which it can exist indefinitely. In existing digital computing devices, various mechanical or electrical devices have been used as elements: [wheels, telegraph relays]... and finally, there exists the plausible and tempting possibility of using vacuum tubes. It is worth mentioning that the neurons of higher animals are definitely elements in the above sense. Following Pitts and McCulloch [1943], we ignore the more complicated aspects of neuron functioning. It is easily seen that these simplified neuron functions can be imitated by telegraph relays or vacuum tubes.\\n\\nA few paragraphs later, he noted that vacuum tubes used as current valves, or gates, are all-or-none devices, and continued:\\n\\nSince these tube arrangements handle numbers by means of their digits, it is natural to use a system of arithmetic in which the digits are also two-valued. This suggests the use of the binary system. The analogs of human neurons, discussed [above], are equally all-or-none elements. It will appear that they are quite useful for all preliminary, orienting considerations on vacuum tube systems. It is therefore satisfactory that here too, the natural arithmetical system to handle is the binary one. (von Neumann, 1945, pp. 359-362)\\n\\nLike McCulloch and Pitts themselves, von Neumann (1958, 1960) did not believe that \"the logic of the brain\" could be the same as the formal logic of the computer. He suggested statistical thermodynamics as a better analogy for cerebral processing.\\n\\nAs for the intended use of the newly designed digital computer, this too was strongly influenced by McCulloch and Pitts\\' 1943 paper. On one hand, it was seen as an invitation to model psychological processes in physical mechanisms. On the other, the eponymous \"logical activity\" and the authors\\' remark that \"the fundamental relations are those of two-valued logic\" suggested how this could be achieved.\\n\\nInitially, many researchers attempted to work at the level of elementary logic circuits like those defined by McCulloch and Pitts. However, it soon became apparent that the thought processes most interesting to psychologists could not be easily conceived at the level of AND, OR, and NOT. Consequently, higher-level descriptions (programming languages) were developed, although these were ultimately defined in logical terms. For instance, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and Clifford Shaw developed the first list-processing languages (the IPL family) to represent symbolic manipulations more directly. IPL functioned as a virtual machine, an information-processing system conceptualized at a level above that of the logic circuits in which it was ultimately implemented. Where IPL led, LISP (and others) soon followed.',\n"," '\\\\section*{The Pendulum in Connectionist Research}\\n\\nFor a period, the two streams of computational modeling—statistical and logical—progressed side by side. However, the early successes of the logical approach, notably Arthur Samuel\\'s checkers player and the Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver by Newell, Simon, and Shaw (Feigenbaum & Feldman, 1963), were not matched by equally impressive achievements on the statistical side. In the late 1960s, Marvin Minsky, perhaps the first to build a connectionist learning device, and Seymour Papert demonstrated that simple networks had unexpected limitations. They suggested—without formal proof—that more complex, multi-layered networks would also prove \"sterile\" (Minsky & Papert, 1969).\\n\\nDespite Minsky and Papert\\'s explicit statement that verifying their intuitive judgment was \"an important research problem,\" the result was a significant decline in opportunities and funding for connectionist research in AI. A few persistent individuals continued to pursue this approach to computational modeling. Additionally, some scientists—neurophysiologists and physicists not connected with the AI community—developed mathematical theories of neural functioning or information processing that were connectionist in nature, if not in name. Rosenblatt and Grossberg, the precursors mentioned by Norman, fall into the first and second groups, respectively. Within mainstream AI, however, logic—not statistics—dominated. The two streams of computational modeling that originated from McCulloch and Pitts\\' work had long since diverged. As far as the AI community was concerned, one had gone deep underground.\\n\\nOnly recently has connectionism resurfaced in AI. According to some, this revival has brought about a reversal: it seems the tables have turned. Many people today claim that GOFAI is utterly discredited.\\n\\nHubert Dreyfus, for instance, described connectionism as a \"devastating\" challenge to traditional AI, stating that \"the rationalist tradition had finally been put to an empirical test, and it had failed\" (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, in press, 1988). The most succinct expression of this view was mentioned in the opening section: False Starts, Real Foundations. Appended as a subtitle to the book title \"The AI Debate,\" this encapsulates the argument for \"reversal\" in a nutshell. GOFAI was a waste of time; only connectionist theories can explain the mind—or so we are told. But is this judgment fair?',\n"," '# The Contribution of GOFAI\\n\\nThe outright dismissal of GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) in favor of connectionism is both hasty and simplistic. These two computational approaches share a common lineage, both tracing their roots back to McCulloch and Pitts. Although their relationship has been strained over the years, they have not been completely alienated from one another. There is reason to anticipate further reconciliation in the future, as we will explore later. In fact, a productive exchange has been quietly occurring for some time, with connectionism already benefiting significantly from GOFAI.\\n\\nThe most fervent advocates of connectionism, such as Dreyfus, argue that any contribution from GOFAI is only valid in a Popperian sense. The pioneers of AI made a bold conjecture, which faced an equally uncompromising refutation. Historically minded individuals might exempt McCulloch and Pitts (and von Neumann) from blame, despite their role in the initial conjecture, as they recommended statistical theories for explaining brain-embodied thought over 40 years ago. However, the AI community as a whole is accused of delaying the progress of psychology for many years, leading to an expensive dead end. The only solace from nearly 40 years of AI research is that it has been shown to be a dead end, prompting the exploration of alternative computational approaches.\\n\\nThis negative assessment of GOFAI has some merit. Undoubtedly, GOFAI\\'s failure to model common sense reasoning, flexible pattern matching, and its inability to achieve graceful degradation has recently fueled interest in connectionist systems.\\n\\nHowever, GOFAI can also be evaluated in more positive terms. In some cases, the computations involved in current connectionist models are essentially comparable to those used in GOFAI models addressing similar problems. Contrary to the widespread belief that graceful degradation is exclusive to connectionist systems, relevant GOFAI programs were often able to handle various types of \"noise.\" Even when the computations differ, they may be of a kind whose relevance was first recognized due to work in the GOFAI tradition.\\n\\nThis does not mean that their absence from GOFAI models caused deficiencies that had to be addressed by different conjectures. Instead, GOFAI took the initial positive steps in identifying their theoretical importance. Many computational constraints or heuristics initially identified by GOFAI are now implemented in connectionist systems, which add the advantages of parallelism and greater noise tolerance.\\n\\nFor example, consider Marrian models of visual processing. These models address issues such as stereopsis, the preliminary identification of line segments (in building the Primal Sketch), and the construction of the 2.5-D Sketch. David Marr\\'s (1982) theoretical approach owes much to insights gained from over a decade of GOFAI work in scene analysis. It recognized that a successful visual system requires systematic knowledge about how 2-D images can be projected within a 3-D world. It also benefited from specific insights from prior GOFAI vision research, such as the concept of gradient space—a formal account of how surface orientation can be represented given certain general constraints on image formation (Mackworth, 1973, 1983).\\n\\nThis should not surprise anyone who takes Marr\\'s emphasis on abstract task analysis seriously. This fundamental question is distinct from the processing-level question of how vision is done and the hardware-level puzzle of what does it. Because the concept of gradient space was developed with abstract constraints in mind, it was a theory that could be used by processing models of any type. Although originally developed for sequential scene-analysis models, there was no reason it could not be used in parallel-processing models as well. Indeed, it must feature in any successful processing model of vision, as it identifies basic constraints on 2-D to 3-D mapping.\\n\\nMarr\\'s theoretical approach—and indirectly, his seminal treatment of stereopsis—was specifically influenced by Minsky, highlighting Minsky\\'s ambivalent role in the history of connectionist research.\\n\\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Marr used ideas about parallel processing to explore how the cerebellum, considered as biological hardware, controls skilled movement (Blomfield & Marr, 1970). He defined a connectionist algorithm whereby neural \"contexts\" (originating in cortical impulses and mediated by the mossy and parallel fibers of the cerebellum) could be learned and reproduced by the Purkinje cells. Although this algorithm was later found to be faulty (eventually leading to a state where all weights are at a maximum value; Sejnowski, 1977), it was a precursor to some current connectionist processes.\\n\\nThis work was an exercise in mathematical neurophysiology and, although influenced by McCulloch and Pitts, owed nothing to AI. Marr did not need Minsky to become a connectionist. However, his shift to theorizing at the \"computational\" level occurred after a seminar on his cerebellum ideas at MIT, where Minsky remarked that we must consider the \"abstract problem of motor control\" before asking the right questions about cerebellar hardware. This interchange led Marr to Minsky\\'s laboratory at MIT, where he decided to focus on \"the problem of vision\" instead (Poggio, personal communication, August 1988).\\n\\nDuring his time at MIT, Marr accepted the prevailing view that the abstract problem of 2-D to 3-D mapping was theoretically fundamental to understanding vision. This view had developed over a decade of AI work in scene analysis, with Berthold Horn elucidating the physics of image formation. Marr\\'s initial research reports criticized GOFAI models of vision, many developed at MIT under Minsky\\'s direction. However, he later incorporated some of their theoretical ideas, including gradient space, top-down processing, and object models. From the start, he accepted the insight, hard-won by scene analysis work, that a general account of image projection must underlie a computational theory of vision.\\n\\nVision is not the only area where connectionist work has benefited from its GOFAI predecessors. GOFAI modeling also pioneered the computation of \"subsymbolic\" functions, previously unimagined in folk psychology. Natural language processing, for instance, involves syntactic and semantic distinctions that are typically inaccessible to consciousness and expressible only in highly technical language.\\n\\nThus, labeling GOFAI as \"False Starts\" is an ungenerous judgment. To a significant extent, the current achievements of connectionism rest on substantive insights gleaned from traditional AI research.',\n"," '## Continuing Influence of GOFAI\\n\\nThe future achievements of connectionism are likely to benefit from the principles of GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence). Sequential processing may be crucial for certain human cognitive processes, such as ordered problem-solving, logical reasoning, generalized thinking involving variable binding, and possibly some structural aspects of language.\\n\\nAt first glance, these phenomena present a challenge to connectionism. While the equilibration of multiple constraints is powerful for pattern matching, it may not be well-suited for modeling conscious planning or arithmetic. For tasks like perceiving similarity or analogy, \"soft\" constraints—which suggest without enforcing—are ideal. However, for logical deduction or ordered contingency planning, they fall short. The virtual machine that performs such thinking seems more akin to a digital computer than a connectionist system; the brain sometimes appears to simulate a von Neumann machine. As Norman (1986) noted, \"people do seem to have at least two modes of operation, one rapid, efficient, subconscious, the other slow, serial, and conscious\" (p. 534), suggesting that the latter might involve computations similar to those used in GOFAI.\\n\\nSome theorists argue that this is not merely a possibility. Proponents of a logicist approach to computational psychology assert that sequential processes and compositional semantics must underpin not only conscious deliberations but also language understanding (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; Pinker & Prince, 1988, in press). If true, then GOFAI\\'s work is potentially relevant to psychology and must be integrated with connectionist foundations.\\n\\nSeveral leading connectionists acknowledged this possibility years ago. They suggested that the theoretical challenge for connectionism is to demonstrate that \"we succeed in solving logical problems not so much through the use of logic, but by making the problems we wish to solve conform to problems we are good at solving\" (Rumelhart, Smolensky, McClelland, & Hinton, 1986, p. 44). In other words, connectionists must show that logical thought can be based on pattern recognition.\\n\\nOne proposed method is that connectionist systems could use multi-level networks that leverage our natural ability to perceive and manipulate the external environment (Rumelhart et al., 1986). The idea is that environmental patterns can be internalized and function in succession, so that a pattern in one network level influences the next equilibrium state in another level, which in turn partially constrains the subsequent equilibration of the first network.\\n\\nFor example, a connectionist computer model has been developed using two mutually influential networks to produce the sequential moves of a game of tic-tac-toe. The constraints within both networks embody the rules and strategy of the game, with one network representing the \"player\\'s move\" and the other the \"opponent\\'s move.\" The opponent\\'s moves might be represented only by a perceptual network reflecting actual events (the opponent\\'s moves) in the outside world. In this case, the player could play the game by repeatedly settling into an equilibrium state in response to the opponent\\'s moves but would be unable to \"think\" about it or plan ahead. However, if these perceptual patterns can be internalized, they can be used in the mind to \"drive\" the equilibration of successive patterns representing the player\\'s own carefully thought-out moves.\\n\\nCurrently, an active research area in computer modeling involves \"hybrid\" computational systems that combine GOFAI and connectionist processes. An early example was a connectionist system that simulated GOFAI production rules, including general rule schemas requiring variable binding (Touretzky & Hinton, 1985). However, the technical challenges involved remain complex and not fully understood.\\n\\nThe nature of the \"combination\" that occurs in the human mind is also a topic of debate. The extent to which connectionism provides \"real foundations\" is contested.\\n\\nConnectionists who argue that logical properties and syntactic structures can emerge from a parallel distributed processing (PDP) base (Smolensky, 1988) face opposition from logicists who view a compositional \"language of thought\" as an essential aspect of human cognition (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). Some believe that the categories of folk psychology are mere approximations of the underlying psychological reality, similar to how Newtonian laws are broad generalizations of quantum-level phenomena (Smolensky, 1988). Others see them as indispensable components of the virtual machine that is the human mind (Clark, 1989). Some claim that our thinking is entirely connectionist, with even the most rigorous conscious thought being an approximation of the ideal of conceptual thinking (Cussins, 1990). Others argue that, while conceptual thought is grounded in and ultimately derives its semantic content from connectionist (perceptuo-motor) processes, it may depend on internal representations more suited to GOFAI accounts than connectionist ones (Karmiloff-Smith, in press; Clark, in press). In essence, the basic architecture may be connectionist, but the relevant virtual machine is not.',\n"," '# Understanding Connectionist Systems\\n\\nBeyond the general philosophical debates, there is considerable uncertainty about how to explain the performance of a connectionist system once it has been developed. A connectionist system that achieves something noteworthy may be just that: noteworthy. Its value as an existence proof may be limited if it remains largely unintelligible. It is only truly enlightening if we can understand why it performs as it does. In this respect, traditional symbolic AI (GOFAI) often has an advantage. The program and its specific execution trace are explicitly available, and sometimes the underlying abstract \"computational-level\" theory is also accessible. In contrast, a connectionist system may be much less transparent.\\n\\nFor instance, NETtalk, a system that learns to pronounce written words, improves its pronunciation with each learning cycle (Sejnowski & Rosenberg, 1986). It achieves this by mimicking a set of provided pronunciations using backpropagation: it compares its current output with the correct output and adjusts the connection weights if they differ. To learn a new dialect, NETtalk must be retrained from scratch; it cannot selectively adjust certain weights to modify specific phonetic features. The network consists of 309 units connected by 18,629 connections, with 26 output units, 80 hidden units, and 203 input units that encode the target phoneme along with its immediate predecessor and successor.\\n\\nNETtalk\\'s performance is impressively reminiscent of the gradually improving speech of human infants. However, even its designers are uncertain about the specifics of its operation. They propose three methods to investigate this: network pathology, records of unit activation, and cluster analysis. The latter identifies the associations most frequently used by the system in partitioning its performance \"space.\" Surprisingly, NETtalk develops an implicit hierarchy of nearly 80 distinctions similar to those explicitly defined in phonetics, such as vowels and consonants, voiced and unvoiced consonants, and so on. Network pathology involves systematically \"lesioning\" the network, either before or after it has learned its task. This approach may provide insights not only into artificial networks but also into clinical neurology. For example, when parts of a recent connectionist model of reading are disabled, the system exhibits various \"dyslexias\" similar to those affecting human patients (Hinton & Shallice, 1989).\\n\\nIt is not clear that explanations derived from these post hoc analyses can fit into the three-tier explanatory hierarchy recommended by Marr. Clark (1990) argued that they cannot. A competence theory may be a useful idealization of what a connectionist system is doing and may help the designer choose relevant inputs and outputs. However, it cannot explain what is truly happening, as the network contains neither explicit nor tacit knowledge of competence constraints. Generally, there is no precise mapping between the information processing in connectionist and GOFAI systems performing \"the same\" task. Connectionists build a network loosely specified by abstract task constraints, allow it to learn the task, and only then identify the high-level principles it embodies. According to Clark, the model\\'s explanatory power lies in these principles, not in the task analysis or the set of connection weights.\\n\\nAn important explanatory dimension concerns the computational potential and limits of different types of connectionist systems. For example, at what noise level does a Boltzmann machine become impractical? What classes of problems can be best solved (or solved at all) by backpropagation learning? How can supervised and unsupervised learning be analytically distinguished, and what algorithms are best suited for them? What is the maximum computational power of connectionist systems with a specific number of units and/or layers? Can anything be said about the optimal relative sizes of the \"receptive fields\" of neighboring connectionist units with overlapping fields? To what extent can connectionism benefit from the theoretical results of years of work in statistical pattern matching? Although some mathematical results concerning various types of connectionist systems have been achieved, much work remains to be done.\\n\\nIt is far too early to be confident about either the potential or the limits of the connectionist systems we currently have, let alone those that will be defined in the future. It is also premature to dismiss traditional AI as a dead end.\\n\\nIndeed, not all connectionists are as dismissive of GOFAI as the term \"False Starts\" might suggest. The leading figures in parallel distributed processing (PDP) believe that \"it would be wrong to view distributed representations as an alternative to representational schemes like semantic networks or production systems that have been found useful in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence\" (Hinton, McClelland, & Rumelhart, 1986, p. 78). They see PDP networks as \"one way of implementing these more abstract schemas in parallel networks,\" noting that their emergent properties (pattern matching, content-addressable memory, and graceful degradation) provide powerful operations that can be regarded as primitives by psychologists considering more high-level theories implemented in traditional ways.',\n"," '# Mother Nature Versus the Walking Encyclopedia: A Western Drama\\n\\nIn 1982, Feldman and Ballard published \"Connectionist Models and Their Properties,\" which helped draw attention to a burgeoning research strategy by giving it a name: connectionism. Since then, the connectionist community has expanded to include subfields like \"PDP\" and \"neural net models.\" Critics of connectionism often aim to discredit it by targeting its \"essence,\" but it\\'s important to recognize the diversity not only in the models themselves but also in the goals of the researchers. There\\'s no reason to assume that all connectionists adhere to a single principle that could be proven false or incoherent. Those making progress in their projects have no need to label their own approach as orthodox and others as heretical. Let a thousand flowers bloom, and the weaker ideas will naturally fade away without the need for ideological condemnation.\\n\\nHowever, the urge to engage in ideological battles is hard to suppress. Even the most focused model builder wants to understand where their work fits into the larger picture, and grand schemes often organize into schools, movements, sects, and revolutions. To gain perspective, one must engage with ideology. My own reluctant involvement in the ideological debates around connectionism began when I was invited to speak at a Sloan Foundation conference on the Foundations of Cognitive Science. I was asked to discuss \"computational approaches to psychology.\" The year was 1984, and the location was MIT, so I structured my talk around an Orwellian cartographic proposal: organizing the various approaches into a polar coordinate map centered on the \"East Pole,\" a term coined by Jerry Fodor for MIT. My message was that there were many \"diametrically opposed\" ways of not aligning with the East Pole, echoing Bishop Berkeley\\'s sentiment: \"Westward the course of empire takes its way.\" (How many people know that Berkeley, California, was named after George Berkeley in honor of this remark?)\\n\\nThat talk was published in a shortened form in the Times Literary Supplement (Dennett, 1984a), and when the full version appeared two years later (Dennett, 1986), it came with a warning and an expiry date: \"Written under a deadline to provide a glimpse of the state of the art in mid-1984, it will likely have a short shelf life. So read it now, or if now is later than 1986, read it as a quaint reflection on how some people thought back in 1984\" (p. 75).\\n\\nRe-reading it today, after reviewing numerous introductions, surveys, debates, special issues, and other commentaries on connectionism, I find that I underestimated its shelf life. However, since many of the points I aimed to make in defense of connectionism have been thoroughly explored by others, I won\\'t repeat them here. I am compelled, though, to reiterate a few points that remain true and important but are still not fully appreciated by later commentators.',\n"," '# Noteworthy Aspects of Connectionism\\n\\nConnectionist approaches are often perceived as more biologically aligned than what Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) have termed \"classical\" approaches, or what I refer to as High Church Computationalist (HCC) approaches. However, a significant reason for biological skepticism towards HCC models has not been fully acknowledged or understood.\\n\\nDouglas Hofstadter (1983) has articulated a concern that resonates with me. HCC systems, designed with a \"100% top-down approach,\" are overly efficient in their use of machinery. As we delve into the nested black boxes, decomposing larger tasks into smaller, simpler ones, we eliminate any nonfunctional or redundant elements. This is not how nature operates; designing systems with such efficiency requires foresight and anticipation of future challenges. These systems, by being meticulously designed, have too much intelligence embedded at their foundational levels.\\n\\nNature\\'s approach to flexibility and design involves a different kind of efficiency, one that emerges from seemingly \"wasteful\" and locally uninterpretable activities. These activities are not initially intended for any specific purpose but are later utilized in various roles within a distributed process (Dennett, 1986, pp. 66-67).\\n\\nTo elaborate, I have previously supported the pyramid-of-homunculi model of functional decomposition (Dennett, 1974, 1978) and still see its merits. However, Hofstadter highlighted that there are different ways to organize tasks: one is a rigid, top-down design, and the other is an opportunistic, bottom-up design that adapts to available resources. Natural selection often employs the latter strategy, which is evident in processes like learning and other environmentally sensitive developmental processes. While it is not impossible for natural selection to have designed us with top-down efficiency, this would be an exception. In nature, time is more valuable than material, so designs often include many elements, only some of which play significant roles.\\n\\nThis blend of functional and nonfunctional elements is biologically justified and counters the functionalists\\' tendency to demand more adaptation from system elements than warranted. This feature is evident in connectionist systems, where no distinction is made between symbols and non-symbols at the computational level. All elements are treated equally, and some may take on symbolic roles, but this is not significant at the computational level. This contrasts with HCC systems, where the distinction between symbols and non-symbols is crucial.\\n\\nThis difference is evident when considering hidden units in a connectionist network. Statistical analysis may reveal nodes that activate for specific subjects, like dogs or cats, while others have no clear interpretation. These nodes may seem like symbols, but disabling them does not significantly impact the system\\'s performance, indicating that other \"noisy\" nodes also contribute. If only the \"symbol\" nodes are preserved, the system fails to function.\\n\\nSmolensky (1988) has noted that the \"virtual machine\" in connectionist systems is not a machine in the traditional sense, as its behavior cannot be formally specified as a high-level algorithm. The low computational level does not directly translate to high-level phenomena with external-world semantics. This breaks from traditional computer science, where hardware idiosyncrasies are typically ignored.\\n\\nThe philosophical distinction between rule-following and rule-described behavior is often illustrated by planetary motion, which follows law-like regularities rather than explicit rules. However, there are regularities preserved under selection pressure, dictated by principles of good design. These \"rules of thought\" are not explicitly represented but are discovered by self-designing systems, similar to the principles of aerodynamics in bird wings (Dennett, 1986, pp. 73-74).\\n\\nThese are my reasons for supporting connectionism, which I see as part of a broader exploration of models that may replace classical rule-based systems. The anthology \"Artificial Life\" (Langton, 1989) offers insights into alternatives to HCC. It highlights the limitations of top-down specifications in biological systems, which rely on global rules that are often intractable. Systems must classify global states using a coarse-grained scheme, as providing a rule for every state is impossible.\\n\\nWhile I appreciate the pioneers of connectionism, I have not committed to any specific school. My caution stems from concerns about scaling, eliminating the need for a teacher, and replacing sentential input and output nodes with more plausible alternatives (Dennett, 1987, pp. 231-232; Dennett, in press).\\n\\nI do not have new concerns to add but wish to address the claim that some human cognitive abilities are beyond the reach of connectionist architectures unless they mimic classical systems. Critics argue that connectionist systems can only achieve these feats by being mere implementations of classical symbol-manipulating architectures (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; Pinker & Prince, 1988; Smolensky, 1988).',\n"," '\\\\section*{Integrating Language into the Connectionist Framework}\\n\\nLanguage is a defining feature of human psychology, distinguishing it from the psychology of other animals. Consequently, language-related cognitive processes pose significant challenges for connectionist models. If connectionist models are indeed fundamental for basic, animal-like beliefs, this is expected, as language is a relatively recent development layered onto older cognitive systems. This addition introduces new cognitive phenomena that are both more powerful and more complex than the underlying processes they enhance but do not replace.\\n\\nThe ability to communicate through language introduces new entities into our environment. We encounter sentences—our own and others\\'—which we hear, remember, write, and speak. Each sentence presents a decision: whether to discard it, forget it, or categorize it as true or false. This process creates a specialized cognitive state, which I previously referred to as \"opinions\" in Brainstorms (Dennett, 1978). Unlike beliefs, opinions are linguistically influenced states unique to language users. They are essentially wagers on the truth of sentences in a language one understands. I propose that cognitive psychology must distinguish sharply between beliefs and opinions, as their underlying psychologies differ significantly. The architecture that supports nonlinguistic perceptual beliefs (or animal beliefs) must be substantially enhanced to accommodate opinions.\\n\\nFodor and McLaughlin (in press) seem to disagree, asserting:\\n\\n\"You don\\'t find organisms that can think the thought that the girl loves John but can\\'t think the thought that John loves the girl. You don\\'t find organisms that can infer P from P&Q&R but can\\'t infer P from P&Q. For this paper, we assume without argument:\\ni. Cognitive capacities are generally systematic in this sense, both in humans and many infrahuman organisms;\\nii. It is nomologically necessary (nonaccidental and hence counterfactual supporting) that this is so;\\niii. There must be some psychological mechanism that ensures cognitive capacities are systematic;\\niv. An adequate theory of cognitive architecture should exhibit this mechanism.\" (p. 2)\\n\\nWhile they acknowledge these assumptions may be \"tendentious,\" I find them evidently false. Some organisms, like vervet monkeys, fail inference tests in ways that suggest they may believe (in an animalistic sense) that the girl loves John, but not necessarily that John loves the girl (Cheney & Seyfarth, 1990). Similarly, some animals might think a lion wants to eat them without being able to conceptualize wanting to eat the lion. The systematicity Fodor and McLaughlin highlight is primarily a language-based artifact, not a fundamental aspect of cognitive operations.\\n\\nAcknowledging that some areas of human cognition require a higher-level \"symbolic\" virtual architecture is not ad hoc. Language, arithmetic, logic, writing, and map-making are inventions that significantly enhance our cognitive abilities, invoking design principles absent in other animals\\' cognitive systems. These are, in a positive sense, cognitive tools (Dennett, 1984b).\\n\\nAn objection to this view is that, as Pinker and Prince (1988) and others argue, language acquisition requires pre-existing symbolic architectures. Even if mature human cognitive competence relies on a virtual machine dependent on language, we must explain how linguistic competence is achieved, which connectionism supposedly cannot provide. However, they have not demonstrated this conclusively. At most, they suggest that reaching mature linguistic competence involves using symbolic architecture elements, which might simultaneously be a byproduct of immature linguistic competence and a prerequisite for advancing to maturity. Such bootstrapping has precedents, so there is no compelling reason to believe an HCC architecture is necessary for language acquisition.\\n\\nWe must proceed cautiously, avoiding past mistakes, as recounted by Dawkins (1986):\\n\\nDonald Griffin described how, when he and Robert Galambos first presented their discovery of bat echolocation in 1940, a scientist was so incredulous that he physically shook Galambos, unable to accept that bats could perform feats analogous to advanced military technology like radar and sonar. (p. 35)\\n\\nWhile it is conceivable that bats possess sophisticated sonar and even predicate calculus or modal logic, we must consider the ecological necessity of bat sonar and question what purpose predicate calculus or modal logic would serve for them.\\n\\nThe \"classical\" HCC approach suggests that only such tools can provide the versatile, generative representation necessary for survival, even for bats. This claim is dubious. Even mammals closely related to us, like apes and monkeys, exhibit limitations in cognitive versatility and generativity (Cheney & Seyfarth, 1990; Premack, 1986). It is likely that the complexity and extensibility of our mental states are recent enhancements, resulting from our species\\' discovery of techniques that transform our brains into different virtual machines (Dennett, 1990). In describing this virtual machine\\'s architecture, we should base it on a plausible mammalian cognitive architecture, capable of handling the daily cognitive demands of a hungry chimpanzee, rather than the intricate musings of a spycatcher or a Francophone visitor to London (Kripke, 1979).',\n"," '# Equipotentiality\\n\\nI have emphasized the fundamental distinction between superposed schemes of representation and more traditional localist schemes. However, distribution has sometimes been linked to even more radical possibilities. Consider Lashley\\'s (1950) famous assertion about brain representation: \"It is not possible to demonstrate the isolated localization of a memory trace anywhere within the nervous system. Limited regions may be essential for learning or retention of a particular activity, but within such regions, the parts are functionally equivalent. The engram is represented throughout the area...\" (p. 477). The first sentence seems to clearly state superposition. However, the second sentence claims that all memory traces are contained in all parts of the brain region. This is a much stronger claim, as it is easy to imagine a case of fully superposed representations where parts of the overall representation do not have the same content as the whole. Lashley was aware of the difference between these two properties and generally claimed that the stronger one was true of the brain. In earlier work, he formulated the principle of neural equipotentiality: \"the apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional area to carry out, with or without reduction in efficiency, the functions which are lost by destruction of the whole...\" (Lashley, 1929, p. 25). For our purposes, we should modify this principle and consider a representation as equipotential if each part of that representation has the same semantic significance as the whole. Every part represents exactly what the whole represents.\\n\\nSome have explicitly maintained that equipotentiality is the essence of distributed representation, and this idea is implicit in much other discussion. Thus, insofar as Lashley is regarded as having determined that memories are represented in a distributed fashion in the brain—a very common interpretation—distribution is at least implicitly equated with equipotentiality. The same is true when we regard optical holograms as paradigms of distributed representation, as equipotentiality is one of the most well-known features of certain varieties of holograms. It is therefore worth spending some time clarifying this notion of equipotentiality, especially in its relation to superposition.\\n\\nEquipotentiality requires that the various parts of a representation \\\\( \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\) have the same content as \\\\( R \\\\) itself. There is an obvious symmetry here with the notion of superposition, which required that the various parts of the overall content have the same representation. This suggests a symmetrically opposed definition: \\\\( \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\) is an equipotential representation of \\\\( C \\\\) if every part \\\\( r_i \\\\) of \\\\( R \\\\) is a representation of \\\\( C \\\\). Unfortunately, this form of the definition seems to allow for tedious counterexamples involving the simple duplication or replication of a given self-sufficient representation. An example is Venetian wallpaper, which duplicates hundreds of identical discrete little sketches of the Rialto all across the wall. Every sketch represents the Rialto (or Venice), and the whole wall certainly represents nothing more, so it would seem that the wallpaper is equipotential. Surely equipotentiality is a more interesting phenomenon than this!\\n\\nOne problem with these merely redundant representations is that their equipotentiality, such as it is, stops at a certain fixed level: portions of the overall representation smaller than an individual Rialto sketch do not have the same content as the whole. One way to rule out such cases, then, would be to require that arbitrary portions of \\\\( R \\\\) have the same content as the whole. Thus, \\\\( R \\\\) is equipotential with respect to \\\\( C \\\\) if every portion \\\\( r_i \\\\) of \\\\( R \\\\) is a representation of \\\\( C \\\\) for every division of \\\\( R \\\\) into parts; that is, no matter how you slice it, each part still has the same content as the whole. This suggests an asymmetry between superposition and equipotentiality: while superposition is an interesting phenomenon for any given discrete division of the content into more than one part, equipotentiality only appears to be interesting for arbitrary divisions.\\n\\nIt is doubtful, however, whether equipotentiality in this sense is ever attained. For one thing, if we take fine enough portions of any representation, it is unlikely we will have any content at all, let alone the full original content. Though holograms, for example, are taken to be equipotential, small enough portions fail to encode anything; all we need do is take some portion smaller than the wavelength of the illuminating beam, and we cannot possibly recover anything of the original image. On reflection, it would be truly remarkable for a nontrivial representation to have the same content in any portion, no matter how small, as is conveyed by the whole. Second, even reasonably large portions of the original representation typically are not identical in content with the original. Lashley himself was careful to qualify his principle of neural equipotentiality with a corresponding principle of mass action, which acknowledged that the smaller the chunk of brain remaining, the worse the performance. Each portion, it would seem, could not have had exactly the same content as the whole; for if it had, it would presumably have been able to generate the same performance. Similarly for the hologram: The whole scene is recoverable from each part, but only with proportionately reduced perspective and image quality.\\n\\nRescuing the notion of equipotentiality in the face of these objections requires a two-pronged strategy. On one hand, we need only require that all portions of some sufficient size (an inherently vague notion) represent the same as the whole. Mere redundancy then becomes one trivial way of achieving this effect, practical in some contexts, such as the preservation of medieval wisdom, but manifestly implausible in others, such as encoding memories in the brain. More interesting methods, such as the convolution transformation underlying holography, vary parts of \\\\( R \\\\) smoothly and systematically as a function of the whole content. Second, we need to explain some sense in which these sufficiently large portions represent the same as the whole despite slight variation or degradation. Intuitively, the portions are all still in some important sense representing the same thing, regardless of the degradation in performance. Sustaining this intuition means formulating some kind of distinction between what a representation is of and how good it is as a representation of that content; or, in other words, a kind of semantic character versus quality distinction. A representation would then be equipotential insofar as all sufficiently large portions have, not the same \"content,\" but rather the same semantic character as the whole, even if at lower quality.\\n\\nWhen do two representations have the same semantic character in the relevant sense? We need here some notion of a privileged or important dimension of the content, such that each part can be seen as semantically coextensive along that dimension, although perhaps varying on others. To illustrate: Why do a hologram and its portion have the same semantic character, even if the portion performs significantly worse in generating the whole scene? The answer is that crudely spatial dimensions of the encoded scene are accorded a certain kind of priority, and what the portion does is recreate the whole scene along these dimensions, albeit in a degraded way. In short, two representations have the same character if their performance is essentially equivalent along what happens to be the intuitively important dimension, though it may vary on others. Lashley regarded regions of the rat brain as equipotential because, with only portions of the region remaining, a rat could perform the same tasks, even if more slowly or clumsily. Hence the important dimension here is simply the fact of performance; speed or agility is relegated to lesser importance and so is just a matter of quality, not character.\\n\\nThis description of the character versus quality distinction is a start, but it is by no means complete because it does not give any general guidelines for determining what the important dimension is in a particular case. It is unlikely, however, that there could be any such general guidelines, because the relevant dimension changes from case to case according to interests and purposes that can vary greatly in ways that have little or nothing to do with intrinsic properties of the representations themselves. It is natural to be impressed by the fact that each portion of the hologram reproduces the same spatial extent of the image. Yet consider the case of an aerospace engineer devising a holographic display unit for a jet fighter. Here the primary advantage a holographic display has over a regular screen is that the generated image conveys depth effects at sufficiently high resolution to assist the pilot in operating the plane. Both depth effects and resolution would presumably be lost, however, if only a portion of a hologram were employed; hence, from the engineer\\'s point of view, the hologram is not at all equipotential. Though the hologram itself remains the same, from one naive point of view it counts as equipotential, although from another point of view it does not. Because the general character versus quality distinction depends on the notion of a privileged dimension, that distinction itself is rendered inherently flexible, even vague; and consequently, the very idea of equipotentiality is without any very firm foundation.\\n\\nIt has already been pointed out that superposition does not entail equipotentiality. Given the symmetry between the concepts, it should not be surprising that the converse is also true: Equipotentiality does not, in general, entail superposition. Thus, consider again the trivial case of Venetian wallpaper. If we consider only parts larger than a certain minimum size, then each part has the same content as the whole. Yet there is clearly one scattered portion of the wall where the Rialto is found multiply depicted, and likewise one portion where the gondola is found, and these portions are entirely discrete, as can be seen by the fact that we could paint over all Rialto depictions while leaving all gondola depictions intact. The wallpaper is therefore trivially equipotential with respect to the whole scene, but not superposed with respect to the Rialto and the gondola.\\n\\nThe relation between these concepts is, however, more intimate than these independence claims suggest. Notice, for example, that full equipotentiality (i.e., equipotentiality of arbitrarily fine portions of \\\\( R \\\\)) immediately entails full superposition. If the whole content is encoded in every part of the representation, no matter how fine, it follows that every part of the content must be encoded over the whole representation. Further, it turns out that standard methods for generating real instances of equipotential representation do, in fact, vary every part of the representation as a function of the whole content, thereby guaranteeing superposition. Conversely, common methods for developing superposed representations often produce something akin to equipotentiality as a side effect. In connectionism, for example, it is common to represent transformations from input to output in one set of weights. It is a well-known feature of such representations that they are relatively impervious to localized damage or noise; thus, removing units or connections makes relatively little difference to overall performance (Wood, 1978). Another way to describe this situation is in terms of the equipotentiality of the representation: large enough portions effectively represent the same as the whole.\\n\\nIn general, insofar as there is equipotentiality, any portion of a representation can take over the tasks of the whole; in other words, equipotential representations are robust by their very nature. This brings the discussion of themes associated with distribution around a full circle. Robustness was seen to be a desirable consequence of at least some forms of merely extensive representation, but it dropped out of consideration in the discussion of superposition. Although superposed representations are often relatively robust, nothing in the definition of superposition itself guarantees this: although a series of items are represented over the same resources, it might be that all those resources are required for the effective representing of any one item. However, with equipotentiality, which is intuitively the strongest form of distribution of all, robustness is guaranteed.\\n\\nDistributed systems or representations are often described as holistic. This is an extraordinarily vague term and usually contributes nothing to our understanding of the phenomenon in question; nevertheless, with the above discussion in mind, it is possible to sort out some things that might be intended. For example, describing a distributed representation as holistic might be a reference to the fact that, when a representation \\\\( R \\\\) is superposed, each part of \\\\( R \\\\) is involved in representing a number of items at once, and in that sense reflects the \"whole\" content. Similarly, in superposed schemes, \\\\( R \\\\) functions as a representation of a number of items at once; in that sense, one state represents the whole content, or each item is only represented in the context of the whole content. Alternatively, describing distributed representations as holistic might be a reference to equipotentiality, where each part represents the \"whole\" content. Each of these senses gestures in the direction of some important aspect of distributed representation; however, superimposing them in one (dare I say, holistic) concept results, in this case, in little more than a blur.',\n"," '# What is Distribution?\\n\\nThis discussion outlines the current concept of distribution, highlighting the diverse themes and significant differences in previous characterizations. It also explores how this concept might contribute to developing an alternative to the Classical Theory of Mind (CTM). After this discussion, what can we say distributed representation actually is?\\n\\nGiven the varied nature of typical instances and the wide range of properties associated with distribution, one might be tempted to view distributed representation as a \"family resemblance\" concept. This would loosely group together different styles of representation that share no significant common properties. Such concepts are problematic for theorizing because they prevent making meaningful general claims about all members of that type. If distribution were such a concept, the project of exploring alternatives to CTM based on distributed representation would be halted.\\n\\nHowever, this is not a serious concern. Current usage should not overly influence our understanding. For conceptual clarity and scientific progress, we should redefine the conceptual boundaries, revising the current muddled use of the term. This would involve providing a new, precise account of distribution, based on the old version but replacing it. Fortunately, there is a way to explicate the concept of distribution that aligns with current usage. One theme—the superposition of representations—is common to many standard characterizations and true of most cases considered paradigmatic. This leads to a proposal: distribution is the superposition of representations, and distributed representations belong to schemes defined around a core method of generating superposed representations.\\n\\nSuperposition is central to distribution because other themes and properties are either too weak or too strong. Extensiveness alone cannot define distributed representation, as many representations that are not distributed consume more than a theoretical minimum of resources. A distributed representation must be more than just spread over a large area or a \"pattern\" over an extended area. This notion must be refined, as common approaches like coarse-coding fail to capture the natural class of distributed representations. Equipotentiality cannot be a definitive feature of distribution, as it is not always well-defined and excludes many representations that seem distributed.\\n\\nSuperposition avoids these issues. It is strong enough to exclude many representations but includes nearly all paradigm cases of distribution, whether from the brain, connectionism, psychology, or optics. As a structural feature, superposition opposes standard localist schemes, where each item is mapped to its own point in the representation space. Superposed schemes inherently violate this order, marking a fundamental difference in representation types. Semantic superposition is not an incidental property but defines a distinct genus of representation.\\n\\nMuch work remains to ground this speculation. The notion of semantic superposition must be precisely defined, and it must be shown that distributed representation schemes can be generated in these terms. This includes demonstrating that many intuitive paradigm cases of distribution fall under superposed schemes. It must also be shown that the claims of incompatibility between superposition and localist styles, like symbolic representation, hold up under scrutiny. If successful, this would allow us to explore the possibility of constructing a theory of cognition on a distributed foundation, offering an alternative to CTM.\\n\\nInvestigating this possibility involves determining whether distributed representation, defined by superposition, meets the criteria set earlier. It is unclear whether distributed representations can effectively represent the information underlying human cognitive performance. Much connectionist work in psychological modeling investigates this issue, but it is too early for conclusive results, especially without a well-developed theory of distributed representation.\\n\\nThere are reasons for optimism. Distributed representation is both general and inherently non-symbolic, promising features. It also has a deep connection with neural networks. In distributed representation, each component is involved in representing many items simultaneously. Neural networks\\' interconnectedness provides excellent conditions for this dependence. While neural networks can implement localist or symbolic structures, they naturally support distributed representations. Insisting on non-distributed representations in a neural network framework would miss the benefits of neural machinery, akin to using digital circuitry without general-purpose symbol processing.\\n\\nThis affiliation makes distributed representation an attractive alternative to symbolic representation. Distributed representations likely exist in the brain, as distribution is a well-established feature of the neurological substrate underlying cognitive capabilities. The concept of distributed representation arose from attempts to describe brain representations, making neural representations paradigm instances. This contrasts with the biological remoteness of symbolic representations. CTM demands a language of thought, predicting \"symbols amongst the neurons,\" but neuroscience has not found syntactically structured representations in the brain. This discrepancy challenges CTM and supports biologically motivated alternatives.\\n\\nThis proposal does not conflict with the autonomy of psychology and neuroscience. CTM holds that psychological generalizations are found at a system\\'s level of description, where it is understood as cognizing, involving representation transformation. Symbolic representation is described abstractly, making implementational details irrelevant. Systems with different physical instantiations can fall under the same psychological principles. Theories and models of cognitive functioning are similar only at this abstract level, with symbolic representation and syntactic structure sensitivity as the binding thread.\\n\\nHowever, advances in neuroscience and connectionism suggest cognitive functioning is not independent of its instantiation details. For human cognitive abilities, focus should shift from abstract investigations to neurobiological mechanisms, their evolutionary context, and specific capabilities. The crucial feature uniting opposition to CTM is not representation form but a commitment to neurobiological authenticity.\\n\\nAn articulated concept of distributed representation reconciles these conflicting views. It has neurobiological plausibility without sacrificing the generality of a psychological hypothesis. Distribution should be understood as the superposition of representations, independent of how superposition is achieved. The variety of known distribution instances, describable in terms of superposition, attests to this characterization\\'s breadth. With a well-developed concept of distributed representation, we can determine suitable operations for processing distributed representations and the mechanisms supporting cognitive functions without describing specific hardware implementations. Arguments for or against such theories can be formulated at this abstract psychological level. This understanding applies to connectionist models of cognitive functions, which, despite neural unit networks, are remote from biological details. This approach is seen in psychologists like Metcalfe, who propose distributed mechanisms for memory phenomena, tested through psychological experiments. With high-level descriptions of distributed mechanisms, we can construct specific models detailing how these mechanisms are built from human wetware, testing hypotheses and stimulating future developments.\\n\\nIn summary, the concept of distributed representation allows us to see cognition as more than just a theory of specific mechanisms performing functions. Its connection with connectionism and the brain highlights the importance of studying the machinery underlying cognitive performance. There is no tension between studying cognition and its neurobiological instantiations, as distributed representation serves as the unifying principle. Thus, the central feature uniting neuroscientific and connectionist alternatives to CTM is not just neurobiological plausibility but a deeper similarity at the level of cognitive theories.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Understanding Addition}\\n\\nOrthodox representationalism suggests that cognitive abilities can be explained similarly to how arithmetic skills are typically understood: through representation and computation. The premise is that cognition can be comprehended using these two fundamental concepts, which are already well-established in non-cognitive applications like calculators. To grasp this concept, it\\'s beneficial to first review the traditional (representationalist) explanation of addition in adding machines.\\n\\nFor a system to function as an adder, its input-output behavior must align with the plus function, $+(\\\\langle m, n\\\\rangle)=\\\\mathrm{s}$. However, the plus function involves numbers as its arguments and values, and numbers, by nature, are not states, processes, or events within any physical system. So, how can a physical system be described by the plus function? The solution lies in numerals—representations of numbers—which can exist as states within a physical system, even if the numbers themselves cannot. A physical system performs addition by manipulating numerals, thereby indirectly handling the numbers those numerals represent.\\n\\nThe input to a typical adding machine is a sequence of button presses: $<C$, $A1,+A2,=>$, which translates to $\\\\langle$ clear, first addend, plus, second addend, equals $\\\\rangle$. The output is a display state, $D$, which is a numeral representing the sum of the two addends. We can view the button press sequences as arguments to a function $g$ that results in display states. An adding machine satisfies $g$; thus, the arguments and values of $g$ are actual states of the physical system. As previously mentioned, addition pertains to numbers, not the physical states of a machine, so a physical system cannot literally satisfy the plus function. Instead, an adding machine instantiates the plus function. It does so by satisfying a function $g$ whose arguments and values represent those of the addition function, or, in other words, have those arguments and values as interpretations.\\n\\nIn summary, an adding machine operates because:\\n\\n1. We can interpret button press sequences (or the internal states they cause) as addends.\\n2. We can interpret displays (or the internal states that cause them) as numbers.\\n3. The device causally links sequences of button presses with displays, satisfying a button press-to-display function. Given this setup,\\n4. If a button press sequence interpreted as $\\\\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{m}$ occurs, a display event interpreted as their sum will typically follow. The device instantiates the addition function by satisfying the function mentioned in step three, as that function can be interpreted as the addition function.\\n\\nTo enable a physical device to perform addition, it must satisfy a function interpretable as addition. This requires designing the device so that representing a pair of addends leads to representing their sum.\\n\\nA helpful analogy for this concept of adding machines is the \"Tower Bridge\" picture, reminiscent of London\\'s Tower Bridge.\\n\\nThe top span represents the function instantiated: +, in this case. It maps a pair of numbers to their sum. The bottom span corresponds to the function satisfied (simply called $g$). It maps a sequence of button presses to a display. The vertical arrows represent interpretation: $\\\\mathrm{I}(<\\\\mathrm{C}, \\\\mathrm{A}1,+, \\\\mathrm{A}2,=>)$ is the interpretation of $<\\\\mathrm{C}, \\\\mathrm{A}1,+, \\\\mathrm{A}2,=>$, namely $<\\\\mathrm{a}1, \\\\mathrm{a}2>$, the pair of numbers represented by $A1$ and $A2$. $\\\\mathrm{I}(D)$ is the interpretation of the display, which will be the sum of $n$ and $m$ if the system functions correctly. Under interpretation, the bottom span is revealed as an instantiation of the top span; computation is revealed as addition.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{Cognition}\\n\\nOrthodox representationalism seeks to understand cognitive systems as entities that computationally perform cognitive functions. This concept requires some clarification.\\n\\nOrthodox representationalism adopts a thoroughly rationalist view of cognition. According to this perspective, a system is considered cognitive if it adheres to the epistemological constraints relevant to its task domain—the domain it is said to cognize. In other words, its behavior is logical, justified, or rational in relation to its inputs and internal states (Haugeland, 1978). This is what distinguishes it as cognizing a domain rather than merely reacting to an environment. Consequently, we have no reason to regard a system as cognitive unless we can describe its actions—its capacities—in semantic terms. This is because epistemological constraints are defined only for propositions or entities with propositional content, which have truth values. Thus, we arrive at the notion that possessing a cognitive capacity involves instantiating a function that relates propositional contents, meaning a function that takes propositional contents as arguments and values and connects them as premises to conclusions. In essence, a cognitive system is an inference engine, a system that warrants an inferential characterization (Cummins, 1983). Therefore, explaining cognition involves explaining how a system can warrant an inferential characterization, essentially how it can reason. The challenge of cognition becomes the challenge of explaining how the system is described by a cognitive function or, in the context of AI, constructing a system that is described by a cognitive function.\\n\\nOrthodox representationalism proposes that cognitive systems are computational systems: A cognitive system is described by a cognitive function because it computes representations whose interpretations are the values of that cognitive function, and it computes these from representations of the function's arguments. This approach allows us to explain why the system warrants an inferential characterization, i.e., why it is cognitive: The system warrants an inferential characterization because it computes representations of conclusions from representations of the corresponding premises. To transition systematically from one representation to another—to compute representations—is, when interpreted, to transition systematically from one proposition to another. If we establish the discipline correctly, we achieve inference, and thus cognition. To assert that cognitive engines exist within this framework is to claim that the behavior of certain entities can be described through an interpretation that reveals their activity as epistemologically constrained—as rational. Once the rationality of the activity is unveiled, we are prompted to inquire how such activity is possible. The strategy employed by orthodox representationalism aims to answer this question by providing a program (computation) and interpretation such that: (a) the system executes the program, and (b) under interpretation, the execution of the program is revealed as the very cognizing identified as the explanandum. The fundamental assumption of orthodox representationalism is that, under proper interpretation, complex symbol manipulation constitutes cognition.\",\n"," '### The Connectionist Alternative\\n\\nA connectionist architecture is composed of a network of interconnected nodes. Each node is characterized by a variable indicating its activation level and a constant representing its threshold. When a node\\'s activation surpasses its threshold, it propagates activation to other nodes through existing connections. These connections have weights that determine the relative amount of activation they can transmit. Connection weights can be positive or negative, allowing a node to inhibit connected nodes by reducing their activation through negatively weighted links. The network\\'s state at any given time is defined by the activation pattern, which includes the activation level of each node and the connection weights.\\n\\nTo input data into the network, specific activation levels are assigned to designated input nodes. Activation then spreads throughout the network based on the initial activation pattern and the strengths of the connecting links. The system\\'s dynamics are governed by differential equations that describe how activation spreads over time. The network\\'s output is determined by the state of the output nodes once the network reaches a steady state. Through processes such as \"backpropagation,\" the connection strengths can be adjusted, thereby modifying the network\\'s input-output function. This is how these systems are said to \"learn.\"',\n"," \"\\\\section*{CONNECTIONISTS AS ORTHODOX REPRESENTATIONALISTS}\\n\\nThe core of the traditional approach is the concept that the elements of formal computation are representations of the inputs and outputs of cognitive functions. We derive the correct output from a given input because the system's causal structure executes a program that connects symbols, whose meanings correspond to the appropriate inputs and outputs of the cognitive function being analyzed.\\n\\nAt this abstract level, connectionism aligns with the same explanatory strategy: A cognitive function is elucidated by demonstrating that its inputs and outputs are accurately interpreted as the inputs and outputs of a function fulfilled by a connectionist network. Specifically, representation serves the same explanatory purpose in connectionism as it does in traditional representationalism: in both frameworks, it bridges the gap between the lower and upper spans of the Tower Bridge.\\n\\nTherefore, Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) are correct in asserting that connectionists are representationalists. Connectionists, like representationalists in general, view the challenge as implementing cognitive functions by computing representations of their outputs from representations of their inputs.\\n\\nTo understand the distinctions between connectionist and other representationalist approaches, we must move beyond this high-level perspective and examine some of the finer details.\",\n"," '\\\\section*{Learning}\\n\\nLet\\'s begin with the concept of learning. In the context of Operational Research (OR), learning is considered a specific instance of representation computation. An OR system learns by modifying its representations rather than altering its program. While an OR system\\'s program might be changed in various ways, OR itself does not offer a systematic explanation for such changes and does not classify them as learning. Instead, these changes might be seen as trauma, maturation, debilitation, etc. This can be confusing because typical OR systems may include programs within their data structures. However, a system that modifies a stored program is not reprogramming itself; it is merely altering its stored representations. A robot might be designed to reprogram itself by physically replacing or modifying one of its circuit boards. Although one could provide a computational explanation for such a change, this is not what is meant by learning, and OR appropriately does not address learning in this manner. All OR approaches to learning that I am aware of assume a fixed functional architecture.\\n\\nFrom this perspective, the program or functional architecture of an OR system is fixed concerning the processes explicitly recognized by the theory. The program describes, at an appropriate level of abstraction, the causal structure of the system. Specifying the representations at a given moment corresponds to specifying the values of the state variables of that causal structure. Just as you do not alter the causal structure of a clock by setting or winding it, you do not alter the causal structure of an OR system by changing its representations. When an OR system learns, it instantiates a learning function by computing representations of the values of that function from representations of its arguments. Learning is simply another instance of cognitive function instantiation.\\n\\nHow should we conceptualize learning in a connectionist system? In connectionist systems, learning is indicated by changes in connection weights. Should we view this as reprogramming—a change in the functional architecture? Or should we consider the connection weights as a form of representation, so that changes in the weights—moving from one point to another in the system\\'s weight space—are changes in the system\\'s representations, not its functional architecture?\\n\\nIf we view learning (in any system) as a change in the functional architecture, then we cannot explain learning by referring to the system\\'s functional architecture. What, then, should learning be explained by? Something must determine how and when the weights change. Because weight changes occur according to a fixed set of principles, there must be a feature of the system\\'s causal structure that remains constant, accounting for the fact that weight changes are described by learning principles. Why not consider this fixed causal structure—the structure underlying learning—as an aspect of the system\\'s functional architecture, and view weight changes as simply changes in a different form of representation? This approach aligns OR and connectionism on the matter of learning, with the common understanding that learning is disciplined representation computation.\\n\\nIt must be acknowledged that, in connectionist models, the representations altered during learning are distinct from those involved in the normal computation of outputs from inputs, as learning alters the connection weights, not activation patterns. However, this is analogous to orthodox computational systems, where the representations altered during learning are generally stored programs rather than the data structures involved in normal input and output. For example, production system learning involves altering, deleting, and adding productions to production memory while leaving the data structures the productions operate on intact. Stored productions in such systems relate to the data they operate on as connection weights relate to activation vectors.\\n\\n**Digression: Supervised Learning**\\n\\nHaving stated that connectionism, like all representationalism, views learning as a special case of computing representations, we should note two important facts. First, as emphasized earlier, the representations altered in connectionist learning are constituted by connection strengths rather than activation patterns. Second, there is currently no connectionist account of supervised learning. That is, there is no connectionist mechanism for effecting the type of learning that requires a comparison between actual output and a correct target output. Upon examining the systematic weight changes involved in various kinds of supervised learning, we find that the entire process is managed by behind-the-scenes programming that corresponds to no explicitly recognized connectionist computational process.\\n\\nFor concreteness, let\\'s examine backpropagation in detail, though the general point applies to every form of supervised learning I am aware of. After each forward propagation cycle, a toggle is switched, altering the code that controls the network\\'s behavior. The current output is then compared with the target, and the result drives a computation of the weight changes, which is effected by binding the weight variables to new values. The key point is that the mechanism effecting the weight changes is not explained by activation spreading processes.\\n\\nConsider a specific example:\\n\\n**FIG. 5.2.**\\n\\nThis is a standard network for computing XOR:\\n\\n1. Input activations are computed from the current record in the input file. This is an allowable kluge: one can assume that input units to the current subsystem are activated via standard connections with other units in the containing system.\\n2. Hidden layer unit activations are computed as a function of input unit activations and connection strengths.\\n3. Output layer unit activations are computed as a function of hidden unit activations and connection strengths.\\n4. The error difference between output and target is computed. This can be effected by a standard connectionist process, namely, inhibition. Activation might be sent to the target by the output, with the resultant activation of the target unit being the difference between its activation at time \\\\( t_3 \\\\) and the activation of the output unit. The error is used to recompute the connection strengths (represented in the diagram by the ovals on the connection arrows). This computation is done behind the scenes; it is not done by the network itself, though a network could be built to do it. Notice, however, that there is no connection between the target unit and the connection strength ovals. The simulation machinery handles this behind the scenes by binding values to global variables that appear in the code defining the connections.\\n5. Same as the first.\\n\\nIt should be fairly evident from this step-by-step explanation that there is no connectionist theory for the type of network change referred to as backpropagation learning in the connectionist literature. There is, of course, a set of equations that quantitatively specifies the magnitudes of the changes, but no connectionist mechanism is proposed to effect these changes; they are simply kluged. As mentioned earlier, I believe this conclusion applies to all forms of supervised learning. Given this fact, it seems more accurate to view backpropagation and similar methods as programming tools, ways of building systems with certain desired properties. It is not automated learning in the way unsupervised learning is, or in the way that orthodox creation and alteration of stored programs is. An orthodox analogy to backpropagation would be the systematic alteration of a stored program by some process external to the model.\\n\\nA connectionist system, like an orthodox system, can learn only by changing its stored representations. However, changes in stored representations count as learning only if they are effected by processes that are part of the system\\'s fixed functional architecture. Thus, supervised learning in connectionist systems is not truly learning but a change in stored representations by a mechanism that has no place in the model itself (and is, in fact, ideologically foreign to the spirit of such models). The illusion that \"supervised learning\" is learning is created by the fact that the externally imposed changes in stored representations—such as those imposed in backpropagation—are typically automated and need not be hand-crafted, whereas, in orthodox systems, externally imposed changes in stored representations must be \"typed-in.\" It seems, then, that connectionist and orthodox representationalists are on par regarding their conception of learning: both require some change in stored representations orchestrated by built-in features of the functional architecture. And we must concede that, although rule-based modelers, for example, have built genuine learning systems—that is, systems that orchestrate their own internal changes—connectionists who use supervised learning have not.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{Computation}\\n\\nIn the previous section, I discussed how both connectionist and traditional representationalist approaches to learning can be viewed through a similar lens, albeit using somewhat abstract frameworks. Now, I aim to apply this perspective to the processing aspect of these systems. Please bear with me, as there is a method to this seemingly stubborn disregard for differences.\\n\\nThere are two key components to programming a representational system: (a) constructing the functional architecture, and (b) incorporating any pre-existing knowledge that is not learned. Connectionists often downplay the importance of architecture building, as they typically start with a single type of architecture and focus on introducing stored representations (connection weights) to achieve cognitive performance. Conversely, the traditional approach officially begins with a formal specification of a competence, followed by an analysis that breaks it down into interacting sub-competencies until reaching competencies with known computational implementations. This is the narrative often presented by those philosophizing about their methodology, such as Marr (1982). However, in practice, traditional research often involves a pre-existing commitment to a specific type of functional architecture—such as production systems—and aims to model a competence within that framework.\\n\\nThe variations within traditional approaches, such as different types of production systems, seem comparable to variations within connectionist approaches. In practice, it appears that everyone operates similarly: starting with a commitment to a particular architecture and then attempting to create an instance that performs a cognitive task. For production system modelers, this involves making architectural decisions about conflict resolution, the use of a separate goal stack, working memory limitations, and so on. For connectionists, it involves decisions about the number of units, the use of hidden units, input encoding, programming individual units, and more.\\n\\nThis covers the first aspect of programming I previously identified: architecture building. This type of programming could, in theory, be done with a soldering iron. It is the modeler's way of creating things that nature produces through growth. The second aspect of programming involves setting the system's initial state, which means establishing the stored representations. Traditional modelers input data structures, while connectionists set weights, either directly or through an automated tuning process known as learning. In principle, there is no significant difference here either.\",\n"," '# Semantically Structured Representations\\n\\nThe debate between connectionists and other representationalists is akin to the differences among traditional representationalists, such as those between production system approaches and theorem-proving approaches. So, why is there so much contention?\\n\\nLet\\'s begin by considering the role of a representation in a representational system. A representation is an entity (be it an object, state, or process) whose significant causal powers are determined by its semantic properties. For instance, when you input data into an adding machine, it creates a state that causally results in a representation of a number, which is the sum of the numbers represented by the input state. This concept applies to both connectionist and traditional representationalist theories. In both cases, there are representations as inputs and outputs, and a causal structure ensures that these representations lead to the appropriate further representations. This causal structure, or functional architecture, can be described as a program for transforming one representation into another.\\n\\nSo, where does the difference lie? Initially, specifying weights and thresholds in connectionist systems might seem more like designing a computer than programming one. However, this is misleading. When programming a computer, you are essentially designing a virtual computer. Connectionists do this through programming, just like everyone else. If you had to design the actual architecture described by the program, it would resemble circuit design more than programming. The same applies to specifying representations. In both cases, you must implement the physical changes in the system that count as representations. Practically, there is a significant difference. We know how to transform quasi-natural language representations (source code) directly into stored representations in a traditional system. We do not yet know how to do this with weights. For example, we can give a virtual traditional representationalist machine the knowledge that \"cats are animals\" directly. However, we do not know how to ensure that typing \"cats are animals\" at a keyboard alters the weights in a connectionist network to represent that fact. This is why we do not yet have connectionist programming languages. However, this is not a fundamental difference between connectionist and other representationalist frameworks.\\n\\nWe have not yet identified a fundamental difference between traditional representationalism and connectionism. I once thought the difference was that, in connectionist systems, unlike traditional frameworks, the objects of computation are not the representations. But this is a misunderstanding. Connectionist computation involves computing output activation vectors from input activation vectors and weights, meaning the computed representation (output vector) is a function of the input representation (input vector) and stored representations (weights).\\n\\nRecently, Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) proposed a different distinction. They argue that connectionist representations are not semantically structured, which they believe is a disadvantage because it prevents satisfactory explanations of unbounded competencies and systematic semantic relations among thoughts. It also seems to hinder the conception of capacities like perception and learning as involving hypothesis formation and confirmation, rather than mere covariation detection as behaviorists believed. For the sake of argument, I concede that structured representations are necessary for sophisticated learning, perception, and unbounded competencies. Instead, I focus on the claim that connectionist representations cannot be semantically structured. While connectionists often argue against the necessity of structured representations, I contend that this is not a position forced upon them by their architectural preferences.\\n\\nTo evaluate this idea, we must clarify what it means for a representation to be semantically structured. I propose the following criteria:\\n\\n1. The representation must have constituents. Constituents need not be parts; it may simply be a property of a representation that it has itself as a constituent.\\n2. The representation must have a syntax, meaning there must be a set of relations among its constituents that constitute its syntactic structure.\\n3. The semantic properties of a representation must be a function of the semantic properties of its constituents and its syntax.\\n4. The semantic properties and syntax of constituents contributing to the semantic properties of containing expressions must be specifiable independently of those containing expressions.\\n\\nIn summary, a semantically structured representation is one with a logical form, as the forms provided by logic are the paradigmatic (and perhaps only) satisfiers of these conditions. Fodor and Pylyshyn claim that connectionist representations cannot have logical forms.\\n\\nWe must understand this claim correctly. It does not imply that connectionist systems cannot distinguish representations based on logical form. It is trivial to build a connectionist system that recognizes conjunctions (or other structures) of arbitrary complexity: simply use Polish notation and recognize the first character.\\n\\nMany connectionists do not believe in a language of thought, meaning they do not believe cognitive computation fundamentally involves computing over representations with logical forms. The issue I am addressing is whether commitment to a connectionist functional architecture necessitates forgoing semantically structured representations (SSRs). Does being a connectionist preclude accepting the language of thought hypothesis? Some connectionists are drawn to connectionism because they believe it offers an architecture that avoids a language of thought. However, we can separate the question of whether good cognitive science requires the language of thought hypothesis from whether being a connectionist about cognitive processes precludes accepting a language of thought hypothesis about cognitive processes. I am concerned only with the latter issue. Thus, whatever preferences connectionists may have regarding representation, they do not affect how commitment to a connectionist architecture constrains hypotheses about representation.\\n\\nFodor and Pylyshyn rightly point out that there is no architectural reason why a connectionist could not adopt semantically structured representations (and thus benefit from the ability to account for unbounded competencies and ubiquitous semantic systematicity). Although it is crucial to determine whether semantically structured representations are required, and if so, why, Fodor and Pylyshyn correctly concede that this is not an issue that must divide connectionists from other representationalists. So, again, what is all the shouting about?\\n\\nThe answer is that Fodor and Pylyshyn, and many others, claim that connectionists who allow for SSRs are not truly connectionists but rather traditional representationalists (whom they call classicists) advocating connectionist implementations of traditional theories. What, then, is the difference between being a real connectionist and merely opting for connectionist architecture at the implementation level? It seems Fodor and Pylyshyn suggest that any architecture supporting SSRs will be a classical architecture, not a connectionist one, at the level where structured representations are defined. A committed connectionist does not want to be a connectionist only in the sense that everyone is a neuronalist, acknowledging that there are activations and weights, like neurons, but that they need not be mentioned in psychological theory. We can state the claim as follows: The level of theory at which psychological explanation occurs must appeal to semantically structured representations, and a level of theory that appeals to semantically structured representations is not connectionist. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) write:\\n\\n\"But we are not claiming that you can\\'t reconcile a connectionist architecture with a combinatorial syntax and semantics for mental representations. On the contrary, of course you can: All that\\'s required is that you use your network to implement a Turing machine and specify a combinatorial structure for its computational language. What it appears that you can\\'t do, however, is have both a combinatorial representational system and a connectionist architecture at the cognitive level.\" (p. 28)',\n"," '### The Arguments\\n\\nFodor and Pylyshyn present four flawed reasons for believing that connectionist systems can and do support semantically structured representations (SSRs). While I have no issue with this part of their discussion, it\\'s important to note that the presence of poor reasoning does not necessarily invalidate the truth of a claim. In fact, Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) offer only a vague suggestion of a positive argument for their thesis.\\n\\nTo validate the connectionist theory as a model of cognitive architecture, one must demonstrate that the processes acting on an organism\\'s representational states are those defined by a connectionist architecture (p. 10).\\n\\nTheir argument is that connectionist representations are not SSRs because, regardless of any structure they might have for us, the system itself only recognizes the structure its functional architecture is sensitive to. Connectionist representations can only be considered SSRs if the processes that alter and construct these representations depend on the logical form of the stored and input representations. Fodor and Pylyshyn rightly assert that connectionist representations are semantically structured only if connectionist processes respond to logical form. However, they fail to provide any argument for the critical claim that connectionist processes are not sensitive to logical form (LF). They assume this, possibly relying on the fact that prominent connectionists often argue that LF-sensitive processes are unnecessary. Yet, without a better understanding of the representation done by connection weights, it\\'s difficult to conclude that connectionist representations are not LF-sensitive. Moreover, it seems feasible to design a connectionist system that is sensitive to the logical form of its input representations.\\n\\nConsider Simplifier, a connectionist network that performs restricted simplification on encodings of truth-functional formulas in Polish notation. Given a conjunction, it outputs the two conjuncts (one in each output vector); given a disjunction, it returns the input unchanged; given the denial of a disjunction, it outputs the denial of the two disjuncts, one in each output vector; given the denial of a conjunction, it outputs the disjunction of the denials of the conjuncts. Since the output format matches the input, output vectors can feed back into the input vector for further simplification.\\n\\n**FIG. 5.3.**  \\nInputs to Simplifier are arrays of ones and zeros encoding symbols that combine to form logical formulas in Polish notation.\\n\\n**FIG. 5.4.**  \\nInput is recurrent, meaning only one row of the input is provided per cycle. It takes five cycles to input the example above into Simplifier. Recurrence allows for inputs of arbitrary length and complexity. Output functions similarly: in each cycle, exactly one node in an output vector (there are two output vectors) will be a 1, with the rest being zeros; $n$ cycles are needed to determine a formula of length $n$.\\n\\nSimplifier supports a strong competence-performance distinction similar to a standard adding machine. Actual adding machines have an upper limit on the sums they can compute, making the function they compute finite. However, the algorithm is general; the upper limit is due to memory (and time, affecting battery life, etc.). Adding more memory allows the device to compute more sums. Simplifier is finite too: there is an upper limit on the formula length it can simplify. Simplifying a complex formula may require several passes, with outputs recycled as inputs. If the formula is very long, complex outputs may reach input nodes for recycling simultaneously with late elements of the original formula. To prevent this, one can add delay buffers to the output end of Simplifier. The number of delay buffers needed for a formula of length $n$ is $n-6$. Thus, adding 50 delay buffers allows Simplifier to handle any formula up to length 44. A delay buffer is simply memory: it does no processing; it just holds an output for a single processing cycle. Therefore, Simplifier\\'s simplifying competence is unbounded, much like an adding machine\\'s adding competence.\\n\\nIt is evident that this network utilizes semantically structured representations. Different activation patterns in the input array correspond to different logical forms, leading to activation patterns in the output array that correspond to logical forms appropriate to the inputs. Moreover, there is genuine constituent structure: for example, the representation of the disjunction is literally part of the representation of the conjunction. The representations have standard Tarskian semantics in both the input and output layers.\\n\\nThe issue then becomes whether Simplifier is merely an implementation of a Turing Machine or another nonconnectionist architecture: Are the logical forms of the representations the features to which the connectionist processes of activation summation and propagation are sensitive? Or do the processes that respond to logical form only emerge at a nonconnectionist level of analysis?\\n\\nWe must be cautious about the rules of this dialectical game. Simplifier serves as a counterexample to Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s claim only if there is no genuine nontrivial functional analysis of the system\\'s simplification capacity that is not expressed in connectionist terms. In other words, defenders of Fodor and Pylyshyn must provide a set of primitive operations/processes that are: (a) nonconnectionist, and (b) correctly analyze Simplifier\\'s simplification capacity. They owe us a nonconnectionist flowchart that specifies a virtual architecture of the network, a virtual architecture not shared with every system weakly equivalent to Simplifier but only by systems strongly equivalent to it.\\n\\nIn the quotation above, Fodor and Pylyshyn suggest that any system genuinely using semantically structured representations will have a nontrivial specification of its (virtual) functional architecture in terms of Turing machine operations, specifically, instructions like \"if reading s and in state $y$, then (move-tape-left; move-tape-right; write $r$ and assume state z).\" There are trivial ways to analyze Simplifier in such terms. For instance, each unit can be treated as a Turing machine, but this analysis misses the point. A connectionist model considers each unit type as representing a primitive capacity; how that capacity is implemented is irrelevant. Any treatment focusing solely on individual units leaves the connectionist narrative unchanged, affecting only its implementation.\\n\\nThe notion that Simplifier is a Turing machine in disguise—strongly equivalent (Pylyshyn, 1983) to a Turing machine—need not be taken seriously. However, Simplifier might be strongly equivalent to some nonconnectionist system, thus serving as an implementation of that system. To evaluate this idea, we need a clear understanding of what \"implementation\" means in this context.',\n"," '# Implementation\\n\\nWhat does it mean for one functional architecture to be implemented as or within another? To make this concrete, let\\'s consider functional architectures specified by LISP programs. Take, for example, the following simple LISP function designed to simplify logic expressions in Polish notation:\\n\\n```lisp\\n(defun find-conjunctions (form)\\n  (cond\\n    ((eq (length form) 1) (return-from find-conjunctions form))) ; An atomic formula—a formula of length one—can\\'t be simplified\\n  (setq form (car (parse form))) ; Parse the formula, adding appropriate parentheses\\n  (cond\\n    ((eq (car form) \\'&) (setq out1 (cadr form)) (setq out2 (cddr form))) ; If the formula is a conjunction, return each conjunct separately\\n    ((eq (car form) \\'V) (setq out1 form) (setq out2 nil)) ; If the formula is a disjunction, return it unchanged\\n    ((eq (car form) \\'-V) (setq dm (demorgan \\'& form))\\n     (setq out1 (cadr dm)) (setq out2 (caddr dm))) ; If the formula is the denial of a disjunction, return the negation of each disjunct\\n    ((eq (car form) \\'-&) (setq dm (demorgan \\'V form))\\n     (setq out1 dm) (setq out2 nil))) ; If the formula is the denial of a conjunction, deny the conjuncts, disjoin them, and return the result\\n  (cond\\n    ((symbolp out1) (setq out1 (list out1))))\\n  (cond\\n    ((symbolp out2) (setq out2 (list out2)))) ; If one of the outputs isn\\'t a list, make it a list. All inputs are lists, so all outputs should be lists as well.\\n  (setq out1 (ne (remove-parens out1)))\\n  (setq out2 (ne (remove-parens out2))) ; Remove the parentheses introduced by the parser, and remove double negations.\\n  (princ \"out1 = \") (princ out1) (terpri)\\n  (princ \"out2 = \") (princ out2) (terpri)) ; Print the results to the screen\\n```\\n\\nThe expressions in bold are not defined in common LISP and must be implemented before the function `find-conjunctions` can be evaluated by a common LISP interpreter. For instance, the function `parse` might be implemented as follows:\\n\\n```lisp\\n(defun parse (form)\\n  (loop\\n    (cond ((not (intersection form (connectives form))) (return-from parse form))) ; If there are no connectives in the formula that haven\\'t been enclosed in parentheses, it cannot be further simplified.\\n    (setq con (find-if #\\'conp form :from-end t)) ; Find the right-most connective in the formula\\n    (setq pos (- (length form) (position con (reverse form))))\\n    (setq pos (- pos 1)) ; Determine the position of the last connective\\n    (setq sub-form (concatenate \\'list (list (elt form pos))\\n                                (list (elt form (+ 1 pos)))\\n                                (list (elt form (+ 2 pos))))) ; Make a list of the last connective and the items it governs\\n    (setq form (enclose sub-form form))) ; Replace the last connective and the items it governs by the last connective and the items it governs enclosed in parentheses\\n```\\n\\nAs indicated, the functions `connectives` and `enclose`, and the predicate `conp` must be implemented before `parse` can be evaluated.\\n\\nIn this context, the concept of implementation is straightforward. `find-conjunctions` itself is implemented as an orchestrated set of calls to more primitive functions: `cond`, `eq`, `length`, `return-from`, `setq`, `parse`, `car`, `cadr`, `caddr`, `demorgan`, `symbolp`, `list`, `ne`, `remove-parens`. In turn, `parse` is implemented as an orchestrated set of calls to `loop`, `cond`, `not`, `intersection`, `connectives`, `return-from`, `setq`, `find-if`, `-`, `length`, `position`, `concatenate`, `list`, `elt`, `enclose`, and so on. This process can be thought of as systematically expanding abbreviations. We could rewrite the definition of `find-conjunctions` by actually substituting the definition of `parse` for the calls to `parse` in `find-conjunctions`. This is precisely what the LISP interpreter does at runtime. In general, if P implements Q, we can derive P from Q by expanding \"abbreviations\" like `parse`, and we can derive Q from P by abbreviating a complex process as a single function call.\\n\\nHow does this apply to the issue at hand, namely, whether Simplifier is a \"mere implementation\" of some \"orthodox\" architecture?\\n\\nFodor and Pylyshyn (1988) must claim that:\\n\\n1. Simplifier implements some program P that manipulates representations of logical forms to perform the simplification task.\\n2. At the level of connectionist description, Simplifier does not consist of processes that manipulate representations of logical forms to perform the simplification task.\\n\\nLet\\'s examine these claims:\\n\\n1. Does Simplifier implement some non-connectionist \"orthodox\" program that performs the simplification task? This would mean that Simplifier decompiles into such a program. That is, it would have to be possible to abbreviate complex processes in Simplifier as the primitive processes of some non-connectionist system. Simplifier would then emerge as an expanded version of some non-connectionist program of the classical or orthodox flavor.\\n\\nThere is nothing inherently impossible about the Fodor and Pylyshyn scenario. We might, of course, construct a number of separate connectionist systems to perform the functions called by `find-conjunctions`, then somehow integrate them (how?). The result would be a system that decompiles into `find-conjunctions`, hence implements it. But what reason do we have to suppose that Simplifier analyzes into a set of connectionist subsystems, each corresponding to a function or instruction in an orthodox system? I would be astonished if this were true: Simplifier certainly was not designed that way, and although it does analyze into subsystems—pools of units with certain functions—they do not compose into an orthodox system; they compose into Simplifier. I cannot prove that Simplifier does not analyze into subsystems weakly equivalent to the components of an orthodox system that performs the same tasks as Simplifier, but I cannot imagine what could make Fodor and Pylyshyn so confident a priori that such an analysis is possible.\\n\\n2. I think the reason Fodor and Pylyshyn are so certain that systems like Simplifier must implement something non-connectionist is that they are already convinced that connectionist systems cannot utilize semantically structured representations. Given this premise, they conclude that a system performing a task requiring semantically structured representations must have a non-connectionist analysis. But this reasoning simply begs the question, as the case of Simplifier makes clear. Simplifier does make use of semantically structured representations. To accommodate this fact, Fodor and Pylyshyn must show that the role of these representations emerges only at some non-connectionist level of analysis. To demonstrate this, they must produce the non-connectionist analysis. Thus, claim 2—the claim about representation—depends on the prior claim 1 about implementation, not the other way around.\\n\\nBefore leaving this issue, I cannot help but speculate that the waters have been muddied by a conflation between two different senses of orthodox or classical: (a) A system is orthodox or classical if it computes over semantically structured representations; (b) a system is orthodox or classical if it resembles LISP, PASCAL, or PROLOG—a variable binding \"read-write\" architecture. A connectionist system can be \"orthodox\" or \"classical\" in sense (a), though it need not be, and a system that is \"classical\" or \"orthodox\" in sense (b) can fail to be \"orthodox\" or \"classical\" in sense (a), as demonstrated by the result of your average programming exercise.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Emergent Knowledge of Rules}\\n\\nSmolensky (1988) describes a network designed to solve qualitative puzzles about electric circuits, such as \"What happens at point $P$ if the voltage is increased at location $X$?\" The answers are determined by the laws of circuitry, including Ohm\\'s law, $V=I \\\\times R$. However, the network does not encode any symbolic representation of Ohm\\'s law. Instead, it stores knowledge of many examples of legal combinations of circuit variable values. This results in a system that exhibits fluidity and flexibility in its use of knowledge. Smolensky notes that the system knows the rules to the extent that, given a proper combination of values for some circuit variables, it can correctly complete the set. However, it does not do so by encoding Ohm\\'s law, as it can handle illegal combinations of values. He writes:\\n\\n\"The system, when given a well-posed problem and unlimited relaxation time, will always give the correct answer. Under that idealization, the system\\'s competence is described by hard constraints: Ohm\\'s Law, Kirchoff\\'s Law—the laws of simple circuits. It\\'s as though the model had those laws written down inside it. However, as in all subsymbolic systems, the system\\'s performance is achieved by satisfying a large set of soft constraints. This means that if we depart from the ideal conditions under which hard constraints seem to be obeyed, the illusion that the system has hard constraints inside is quickly dispelled. The system can violate Ohm\\'s Law if necessary, but if it doesn\\'t need to, it won\\'t. Outside the idealized domain of well-posed problems and unlimited processing time, the system gives sensible performance. It isn\\'t brittle like symbolic inference systems. If given an ill-posed problem, it satisfies as many constraints as possible. If given inconsistent information, it doesn\\'t fall flat and deduce just anything. If given insufficient information, it doesn\\'t deduce nothing. Given limited processing time, the performance degrades gracefully. All these features emerge \\'for free,\\' as automatic consequences of performing inference in a subsymbolic system; no extra machinery is added to handle deviations from ideal circumstances.\" (Smolensky, 1988, p. 20)\\n\\nThis quote illustrates the flexibility that connectionist encoding (of the distributed, subsymbolic variety) provides. However, this flexibility, achieved through emergent, example-driven knowledge of rules and categories, has its limitations. It provides fluidity as long as the structure of hard rules governing a domain remains unchanged. In more dynamic cases, this mode of representation leaves the system inflexible and unable to adapt, which is the cost of purely emergent knowledge.\\n\\nConsider a scenario where we engage in deviant electrical circuitry problem-solving. Suppose the relation between resistance and voltage is strictly inverted, so that where voltage would normally increase by an amount $P$, it now drops by that same amount. The network\\'s flexibility within a static domain becomes a source of inflexibility in a plastic (i.e., systematically alterable) domain. The network lacks a representation of voltage, resistance, and their relationship, making it impossible to simply reverse the stored representation. Instead, it requires re-training or reprogramming in a global and non-obvious manner, resulting in a network well-adapted to a static domain but unable to accommodate further systematic changes easily.\\n\\nThe ability to cope with a plastic domain is crucial, as it separates \"higher cognizers\" (humans, chimps, dolphins) from others. Consider a network that learns to assess bank loan applications. If the domain is plasticized, such as reversing good and bad postal addresses due to bureaucratic changes, a system with explicit representations could easily adapt. However, a soft, distributed system would require massive re-training. Similarly, if economic circumstances change, making a steady job more salient, the network would struggle to adapt quickly.\\n\\nPollack (1989) reports an efficient connectionist solution for the six-city version of the traveling salesman problem, which failed to generalize to the seven-city version. This highlights a lack of flexibility in the plastic domain.\\n\\nThe moral, as argued by Kirsh (1987), is that systems benefit from manipulating labels for classes of entities (e.g., \"good postal address\") and defining and redefining complex explicit rules embedding those labels. This suggests an argument for the explicit representation of not just data structures but also the rules applied to such structures. While not all rules can be explicit, some must consist of direct tendencies to action. However, the point about plastic domains suggests that human cognizers\\' flexibility demands rule-explicitness. Annette Karmiloff-Smith\\'s theory of representational redescription supports this conclusion.\\n\\nAn objection to the argument about plastic domains is that human experts also struggle with systematically altered domains. However, studies on transfer of learning cases show a cognitive separation between young infants and older children or higher animals. This separation concerns the ability to transfer abstract principles to related but different problems. Adult humans can map an abstract problem solution onto a new domain, a significant achievement catered to by some connectionist models.\\n\\nThe cases focused on in this chapter require partial reorganization of a domain\\'s relational structure. While standard cases keep relations fixed and map entities from one domain to another, special cases demand variation of some relations (e.g., $V=I \\\\times R$ to $V=I+R$). In banking, shifts in the economy can cause a global reordering of loan-worthiness indicators, yet expert bankers adapt rapidly. Success in such cases requires a conception of the domain as comprising independently variable entities and relations. Distributed, emergent connectionism builds relations into entity representations, making it impossible to vary relations while retaining entity representations. Only explicit representation of both entities and relations can underpin success in these cases.\\n\\nCan humans succeed at such tasks? Anecdotal cases of bankers and logicians suggest so, as does research on children\\'s drawing. However, no established psychological research conclusively decides the issue. Even if humans possess these abilities, connectionism may still be an incomplete psychological model. The re-configuration of explicit rules might occur outside the head, with the human mind using connectionist representations augmented by public language symbol structures. An expert banker\\'s ability to adapt to a radically plasticized domain could be explained by possessing linguistically formulated rules that can be reconfigured as needed.\\n\\nDevelopmental theories, such as Karmiloff-Smith\\'s, suggest that flexibility precedes linguistic expression. Children exhibit flexibility before they can express knowledge linguistically. In tasks like drawing, the ability to reconfigure linguistic descriptions is unhelpful. Theories that depend on language for cognitive characteristics may misplace the emphasis. Our abilities with language likely result from a deeper cognitive difference that groups us with some nonlinguistic higher mammals but separates us from simpler organisms and standard connectionist networks. This idea is further explored in Clark\\'s work. The following section examines a theory concerning the roots of this cognitive difference.',\n"," '# Representational Redescription\\n\\nChildren, and indeed human adults, appear to differ from basic connectionist systems in that they are internally motivated to develop increasingly abstract representations of their problem-solving abilities. This hypothesis, extensively discussed by Clark and Karmiloff-Smith (in preparation), has been explored in a series of influential papers by Annette Karmiloff-Smith (1979, 1986, 1987, 1988, forthcoming a, forthcoming b). She proposes a phase-like model of human cognitive development, suggesting that unlike most animals, humans are driven by internal forces to transcend mere success in a domain and seek more flexible representations of the strategies that led to that success. As Karmiloff-Smith describes, we move beyond \"behavioral mastery\" and redescribe our functional procedures in a series of higher-level languages. This process of representational redescription, which may eventually lead to conscious, verbal access to the constructs involved, allows the organism to extract more value from information it already possesses through its functional procedures.\\n\\nThe parallel with our discussion of the Ohm\\'s law network is immediate. The network achieves a form of behavioral mastery in its domain but does not progress beyond that mastery, remaining in phase one of Karmiloff-Smith\\'s model. The complete model involves several phases, some of which will be detailed later. For now, we focus on the broadest details:\\n\\n1. **Basic Mastery**: The system can navigate the problem domain, but the procedure relies heavily on external inputs and remains unstructured from the organism\\'s perspective.\\n\\n2. **Higher-Level Re-descriptions**: The functioning procedure is treated as a new problem domain, leading the organism to unconsciously theorize about it. This theorizing results in the organism redescribing the procedure underlying its basic mastery in a series of higher-level languages, potentially culminating in conscious access to problem-solving procedures in the domain (Karmiloff-Smith, 1986, pp. 102-103).\\n\\nAn essential feature of this account is that lower-level descriptions and procedures are not discarded as higher ones become available. Instead, they remain intact and can be deployed when appropriate. Karmiloff-Smith has tested this hypothesis in various experiments across different problem domains, from knowledge of the article system (Karmiloff-Smith, 1986) to understanding physical causality (Karmiloff-Smith, 1988). I will describe a single illustrative experiment concerning children\\'s drawing. The experiment, detailed in Karmiloff-Smith (forthcoming a), involved children aged 4-6 and 8-10. They were asked to draw (a) a house and then (b) a \"funny house\" (or a \"house that doesn\\'t exist,\" with various instructions used to ensure understanding).\\n\\nThe hypothesis was that initially, children would have basic mastery in house drawing but would not have developed higher-level redescriptions, leading to limitations in their drawing behavior.\\n\\nChildren of all ages could draw a basic house. The interesting data concerns:\\n\\n1. A small number of younger children who seemed unable to draw a funny house, suggesting a pure un-redescribed competence.\\n2. The striking differences in the types of alterations to the basic house exhibited by children of different ages, indicating various constraints at different phases of redescription.\\n\\nSome children struggled to draw a house that doesn\\'t exist, while others, presumably those with a higher-level, \"chunked\" representation of their basic procedure, could produce strange houses—ones lacking doors, with extra windows, or with reversed door and window locations, or even with elements from other categories (e.g., a piece of a ship) inserted. A developmental sequence in the type of alterations was observed:\\n\\n(a) Changes in the shape and size of parts, (b) changes in the shape of the whole, (c) deletion of elements, (d) insertion of new elements, (e) changes in position/orientation, and (f) insertion of cross-category elements.\\n\\nChildren of all ages (in the successful class) could make changes of types (a) to (c), but only older children (8-10) generally made changes of types (d) to (f) (Karmiloff-Smith, forthcoming b). How is this explained?\\n\\nA mundane hypothesis, as Karmiloff-Smith (forthcoming b) suggests, is that younger children simply hadn\\'t thought of the more subtle changes. An intriguing hypothesis is that the way their knowledge was represented made them incapable of such changes. To decide between these, a follow-up experiment was conducted. Eight younger subjects who had only made changes of types (a) to (c) were asked to draw two pictures involving other types of change: a man with two heads (an insertion change) and a house with wings (a cross-category change). All eight quickly and fluently drew the house with wings, but seven out of eight made a revealing \"error\" in the other task. Instead of drawing a man with two heads, they drew one body and head, then a second head, and:\\n\\n> \"went on laboriously and very slowly to draw two bodies, two arms and legs on each body, etc., using a complete man drawing procedure for each head and then kept starting again because dissatisfied with the result. They had similar difficulties simply copying a model provided by the experimenter and succeeded only very laboriously and slowly. By contrast, when other 8-10 year olds interrupted sequential order to insert a new sub-routine for drawing a second head, they continued drawing a single body with the speed of their normal drawing procedure.\" (Karmiloff-Smith, forthcoming b, p. 15)\\n\\nThe children\\'s difficulty in fluently producing a two-headed figure suggests that the differences between the age groups are not due to a simple lack of imagination. However, the winged house case appears anomalous. Karmiloff-Smith (forthcoming b) suggests that to explain the data, we need to consider the constraints operating at the first level of representational redescription. At this point, she speculates, the initial procedure responsible for basic mastery in the domain has been redescribed as a \"sequentially fixed list,\" inheriting a constraint from the bare procedural level. Such redescription enables the child to \"introduce variables on size and shape,\" but the constraint on the sequential order of elements remains. In the case of the man with two heads, the child must interrupt this sequential order, which is challenging. In contrast, wings can be added to a completed house drawing sequence, making this addition relatively easy. The key data thus concerns the relative ease of production.\\n\\nBased on the follow-up experiment, Karmiloff-Smith postulates the following structure within the class of successful attempts at \"funny-X drawing\": First, a phase with sequentially constrained redescription (young children capable of drawing a fluent winged house but not a fluent two-headed man). Second, a phase where the sequential constraint is lifted (older children capable of fluent drawing with mid-routine inserts).\\n\\nIt is important to note that this is not intended as a model of stages in child development but rather as a model of recurrent phases that occur even in adult learning. Karmiloff-Smith suggests that adult learning in a phonological awareness task fits this model, as does the acquisition of musical skills (e.g., learning to play the piano, where one begins by learning to play a piece in sequence and progresses to being able to start in the middle of the piece and eventually play \"variations on a theme,\" changing all aspects of the sequential order, introducing insertions, and so forth) (forthcoming b).\\n\\nThe general model of phases of learning that has emerged is as follows:\\n\\n- **Phase 1**: Basic Mastery via a \"functioning procedure.\"\\n- **Phase 2**: Redescription subject to sequential constraint.\\n- **Phase 3**: Redescription with sequential constraint relaxed.\\n\\nThis model of expertise challenges the one recently developed by Paul Smolensky (1988). In Smolensky\\'s model, the expert begins with classical-style representations underpinning their competence, using these phases merely to bootstrap their way to novice competence. True expertise is achieved only by programming a connectionist network to carry out the task through prolonged experience and practice in the domain (for full details, see Smolensky, 1988, sect. 2). However, on Karmiloff-Smith\\'s model, the availability of a trained network is sufficient only for the kind of expertise found in, say, the Ohm\\'s law network. Real human expertise involves flexibility and creativity (e.g., the ability to draw a \"funny house\") that suggests a more classical level of representation coexisting with the fast, efficient connectionist procedure. Smolensky\\'s model, we may say, is a model of animal expertise only.\\n\\nThe idea is that older children can treat the problem domain as fully plastic. They have representations that are sufficiently modular and systematically manipulable to allow the selection and rearrangement of elements from the domains, interrupting the drawing at any point, and so on. This kind of plasticity seems to require the more modular and recombinable representations associated with classical approaches (see Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988).\\n\\nIn summary, the conjecture is that human expertise is supported by a multilevel cognitive architecture in which fast, efficient but somewhat limited connectionist representations handle much daily online processing, while more challenging situations are addressed by representations of a more classical nature. It is suggested that only Phase 1 style representations are plausibly treated as connectionist representations, and that the ascent to higher levels of redescription constitutes a progression between classical representational formalisms, potentially culminating in a full-fledged Fodorian language of thought (see Karmiloff-Smith, 1987, p. 10). At the very least, we require some form of representation (either classical or some yet-to-be-discovered but recognizably connectionist kind) in which the elements of rules are functionally discrete, capable of systematic transformations as described.\\n\\nThe thrust of our brief exploration into developmental psychology (for a sustained treatment, see Clark and Karmiloff-Smith, in preparation) is that systems where problem solutions are effective (as in the basic house-drawing procedure) but not yet made explicit are intrinsically limited. These limitations arise from the inability of such systems to treat the problem solution as a structured object capable of systematic amendment. Whether treating a problem solution as a structured object requires classical internal representation or simply a more sophisticated use of connectionist resources remains unclear. It is also unclear whether the idea of explicit representation is purely functional; that is, whether any suitably manipulable item should be considered explicit. What seems clear, however, is that a child unable to draw a \"funny house\" is in a similar position to the Ohm\\'s law network that cannot handle a deviant domain where V=C+R. Radical flexibility—the ability to rapidly adapt to a systematically altered set of domain rules—is achieved only by making the emergent rules explicit and available for systematic reconfiguration by other processors. Structured knowledge (of both data and rules) provides flexibility in plastic domains, while emergent, unstructured knowledge offers flexibility in static domains. The all-around cognizer should be capable of both, challenging the evangelists of both connectionism and classicism.',\n"," '# The Believing Kind\\n\\nWe might conclude by considering a radical yet intriguing hypothesis: that the scientific essence of a genuine believer involves the deployment of a mechanism for representational redescription.\\n\\nThe motivation for this hypothesis is straightforward. There is a clear need to distinguish genuine believers from those that are close but not quite there. This group likely includes simple machines, lower animals, and philosophical constructs like the giant look-up table (which contains a pre-programmed response for every input) and the radio-controlled Martian puppet. These systems can be treated as if they possess certain beliefs and desires, but intuitively, they do not truly have such states. This suggests that our ordinary concept of a believer does not, contrary to some views (e.g., Dennett, 1987), treat \"believer\" as a purely observational category. Instead, it involves a commitment to a specific, though currently unknown, internal structure.\\n\\nThis is not particularly surprising. Historically, humans had a concept of gold and were concerned with distinguishing genuine gold from imitations, even though they initially had no idea of its underlying constitution. It was only through scientific discovery that we identified gold\\'s essential feature: its atomic number, 79. Similarly, the concept of a believer may include the idea of an underlying constitution, the specifics of which are a matter for scientific discovery. Once we understand the scientific essence of a believer, we can justify our intuition that some lower animals, look-up tables, and similar entities \"don\\'t make the grade.\" In essence, we will be able to classify such cases as instances of \"fools\\' belief,\" much like we now classify some shiny metals as \"fools\\' gold.\"\\n\\nIf we accept that the concept of a believer includes a commitment to some scientific essence, why assume that this essence involves representational redescription? The short answer is that this process results in systems exhibiting a distinctive kind of flexibility, which plausibly separates the human expert logician from, say, a beaver that is an expert dam builder but cannot creatively alter its dam-building procedure. The human logician can adapt her skills to highly deviant logics, whereas the Ohm\\'s law network and the beaver cannot. The long answer involves three additional considerations: (a) the often-suggested link between high-level cognition and meta-representational abilities (the ability of a system to represent its own internal states to itself); (b) the need for higher-level representations to be grounded in a more basic interaction with the world; and (c) a speculation about the link between becoming consciously aware of our mental states and the process of redescription. Detailing these would take us too far afield, so I will conclude by addressing an unsettling implication of the idea of a believer as a scientific kind.\\n\\nI have suggested that the concept of a believer may inherently involve the idea that believers are a natural kind with a specific, though unknown, scientific essence. In this respect, the concept of a believer is akin to the prescientific concept of gold. However, consider this: it is possible that there might have been no scientific story capable of unifying a significant number of instances of shiny metallic substances that we pretheoretically called gold. Out of a million samples, perhaps no two were alike beyond their surface properties. In such a case, as Martin Davies has often reminded me, we would say that science discovered there was, in a certain sense, no such thing as gold. That is, nothing fit the original concept, which involved an underlying and unifying constitution capable of distinguishing fools\\' gold from the rest.\\n\\nCould the same fate await the pretheoretic concept of a believer? If that concept indeed includes the idea of a genuine, non-observational kind, it might turn out to be misguided. There might be no scientific story revealing an underlying common constitution for the true believer. In such a case, the correct, though unsettling, conclusion would be that believers (in the original sense) do not exist. One way to avoid this consequence is to hope to discover another kind of non-observational kind that unites genuine believers. Some philosophers (e.g., Dretske, 1988) believe the kind in question is an epistemic kind defined by the causal history of the being\\'s engagement with the world. Others (e.g., Morris, forthcoming) believe it is a moral kind: the set of beings whose behavior is assessable as good or evil. The prospects for either approach are uncertain, though the epistemic requirement may impose an additional necessary condition alongside the internal structure condition (see Clark, forthcoming b). My concern here has been to highlight the risk involved in analyzing the notion of a believer as a scientific kind. If no scientific kind is present, eliminativism would be unavoidable. Such is the price of properly respecting the believer\\'s internal structure.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Connectionism and Indicational Content}\\n\\nTo begin our discussion, it\\'s helpful to consider how connectionists typically attribute content to the internal states of their networks. This chapter focuses on networks that aren\\'t manually configured but are instead trained to perform specific tasks using a learning rule. In such scenarios, the network\\'s connectivity evolves in a self-organizing manner based on the inputs it receives during training. It\\'s often asserted that this learning process results in the formation of \"internal representations\" within the network\\'s hidden layers (e.g., Hinton, 1986; Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986; Rumelhart & Zipser, 1986). In many instances, developing useful representations is seen as a primary objective of training a network.\\n\\nSometimes, the behavior of hidden units can be easily interpreted semantically. For example, Elman and Zipser (1987) trained multilayered networks to map speech sounds to corresponding phonemes like \"bi,\" \"gi,\" and \"di.\" The network\\'s inputs were digitized sound patterns produced by a human speaker, encoded as activation patterns over the input units. During training, a large set of speech segments was presented to the network, and the connection weights were adjusted using the back-propagation of error rule (Rumelhart et al., 1986) to gradually minimize the overall error for the given set of input-output patterns. After numerous training cycles, the network could accurately label input phonetic segments and demonstrated some generalization to new examples. By tracing the activation of hidden units in response to different input patterns, the authors found that some hidden units could be interpreted as vowel or consonant detectors.\\n\\nIn many cases, analyzing the behavior of groups of units is more informative than focusing on individual units. It has become common practice to apply hierarchical cluster analysis to the activation patterns over the hidden units. The resulting cluster structure allows for grouping input patterns into classes that the network treats as similar (cf. Sejnowski & Rosenberg, 1987). Analyzing networks is increasingly recognized as central to a connectionist theory of representation (e.g., Smolensky, 1988). Although there isn\\'t yet a comprehensive inventory of methods with explicit guidelines for their application, the development of network analysis methods is thriving. Several interesting new techniques, such as principal components analysis (Elman, 1989) and \"contribution analysis\" (Sanger, 1989), have been proposed.\\n\\nThe more common procedures for interpreting hidden units seem motivated by the goal of discovering regular relationships between input features and the activation of hidden units. The assumption is that one can infer the semantic content of hidden units in a relatively straightforward manner from their correlational relationships with environmental states (or more precisely, from their relationships with encodings of such states over the input units). For instance, when Elman and Zipser (1987) noted that \"unit 3 is a vowel unit since it is strongly on for all \\'a\\' and off for the other vowels\" (p. 10), they relied on correlational relationships between input patterns and the activity of the hidden unit. We will use the term \"indicational content\" to describe cases where content is ascribed to internal states based on what these states indicate about external states.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that in more complex (and realistic) cases, it may be impossible to detect dependencies between hidden units and input patterns that allow for easy interpretation (cf. Ramsey, Stich, & Garon, this volume). Especially in radically distributed networks, the relationships between input patterns and the activation profile of a set of hidden units may be so complex that describing them in natural language terms would be impossible. For now, we will set aside these complexities and discuss the previous examples in the broader context of the recent philosophical debate on meaning and internal representation.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Semantic Content of Internal Representation}\\n\\nIf our analysis is accurate, the general approach to semantic interpretation underlying the interpretation of connectionist networks shares intriguing similarities with recent proposals for a correlational theory of semantic content in the philosophy of mind. To clarify this analogy, we will examine the two primary philosophical research programs aimed at developing a naturalized theory of semantic content. Both approaches define representations relationally, but they differ in the types of relations they consider important.\\n\\nThe first research program, known as externalism, seeks to explain representation through a lawlike dependency relationship between a representing event and the external event it represents. Within this framework, various versions of correlational theories can be found. The second research program, often referred to as internalism, aims to explain representation through dynamic relationships between events internal to a representing system. This approach encompasses numerous versions of conceptual role or functional role semantics.\\n\\nOur discussion of these approaches aims to shed light on the general assumptions about meaning that underlie and justify the connectionist use of representational terminology, as well as the theoretical commitments and challenges involved in attributing semantic content to connectionist networks. We will begin our exploration with a prominent version of externalism.',\n"," '# Correlational Semantics and the Problem of Misrepresentation\\n\\nThe most comprehensive correlational semantics have been developed by Dretske (1981, 1988), who builds upon Grice\\'s (1957) concept of natural meaning. For instance, the ringing of a doorbell naturally means someone is at the door if the ringing reliably indicates the presence of a person. There must be a genuine dependency between the indicator and the indicated event, allowing for counterfactual statements like, \"If there wasn\\'t someone at the door, the doorbell wouldn\\'t ring.\" This objective, mind-independent indicator relationship forms the foundation of Dretske\\'s ideas about mental content.\\n\\nHowever, many philosophers argue that this indicational content is insufficient to explain two key characteristics of cognitive systems: their capacity for misrepresentation and the conceptual relationships between internal representational states. We first address the issue of misrepresentation.\\n\\nConsider walking through a field at twilight and mistaking a scarecrow for a man. This is a case of misrepresentation. Correlational theories struggle to account for such instances. If the represented event causes the representing event, then representation can only occur if it is true, making misrepresentation impossible. Correlational approaches seem inadequate to explain this fundamental feature of representation (Cummins, 1989; Fodor, 1984). Connectionist systems, which rely solely on indicational content, face the same challenge.\\n\\nDretske\\'s (1988) recent work is particularly relevant to this issue. He distinguishes between indication and representation: \"what a system represents is not what its (expressive) elements indicate or mean. It is what these elements have the function of indicating or meaning\" (Dretske, 1988, p. 59). For example, in frogs, certain brain states indicating small, dark, moving spots are linked to food-catching behavior because these spots are typically bugs, which are adaptive for frogs. This neural structure\\'s natural function is to indicate bugs, even if the spots are replaced by non-adaptive lead pellets. Dretske argues that the neural state still means bugs because that is its function. Thus, the frog misrepresents pellets as bugs.\\n\\nDretske acknowledges that this account\\'s validity depends on determining an organism\\'s natural function (cf. Millikan 1986). Some philosophers, like Dennett (1987), argue that an internal state\\'s function is intrinsically indeterminate. Dretske, however, attempts to define natural function through behavioral adaptation. If an internal state $I$ indicates an external state $E$ and causes behavior $R$, and if $I$\\'s indication of $E$ explains $R$, then $I$\\'s function is natural if $R$ is adaptive under normal conditions. The most intriguing cases involve organisms capable of individual learning, where internal indicators and motor outputs are shaped by environmental consequences. For Dretske, an internal state must acquire its indicator function through learning to have representational content. He considers a system a natural representational system only if it can develop and use such indicator functions.\\n\\nThe first key conclusion is that not every indication is a representation. To assign representational content to a network\\'s states, one must specify the structure\\'s indicating function. Connectionists\\' focus on learning implies a similar assumption, though this is sometimes obscured by equating representational content with indicational content. Smolensky (1988) emphasizes the importance of maintaining \"a large number of goal conditions\" under various environmental conditions for cognitive systems. To develop this capacity, a system must learn numerous internal states with diverse indicator functions in Dretske\\'s sense. Connectionist learning procedures aim to tune hidden units to input patterns so that their indications are adaptive for the desired input-output mapping. A hidden unit\\'s indication evolves during learning because it is adaptive for training goals.\\n\\nIn some cases, the indication function of hidden units can be straightforwardly described, as with the vowel detector example. However, in more complex scenarios, it may be impossible to determine how a unit\\'s indicational content relates to the network\\'s overall input-output mapping. While a hidden unit must have some indication function due to learning, this function may be opaque regarding our ability to express its semantic content (Ramsey et al., this volume; Stich, 1988).\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of an indicator function is more problematic than previously suggested. Dretske\\'s approach implies that even a perfect replica of a representational system is not representational without a learning history to acquire indicator functions. Most would consider such a system representational because it replicates the same mapping between external states, internal indicators, and behavior as the original (cf. Cummins, 1989). Additionally, distinguishing between a learning phase, where indicator functions are acquired, and a \"testing\" phase, where misrepresentation may occur, is challenging (Fodor, 1984). The success of a connectionist theory of representation based on correlational semantics depends on addressing these issues. We will revisit this point in the final section of the chapter.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Conceptual Role Semantics and the Interconnectedness of Internal Representations}\\n\\nWe now address the second challenge for externalist accounts of semantic content: the fact that representational states are not only linked to external states but also have internal relationships among themselves. P. M. Churchland and P. S. Churchland (1983) have argued that the externalism research program, particularly the correlational approach, is inadequate and can be enhanced by a form of internalism, specifically a version of conceptual role semantics. This influential yet somewhat vague program suggests that the semantic content of a representational state is defined by the computational or inferential role it plays within a system\\'s cognitive framework. Unlike indicational content, the Churchlands refer to this type of content as translational content. This term aims to capture the intuition that when a perceiver attributes content to a system\\'s internal states, they attempt to establish a translational mapping between the system and themselves, postulating that the system\\'s representations fulfill the same computational or inferential role as in their own representational scheme.\\n\\nHowever, as both Dretske (1983) and Fodor (1987) have noted, conceptual role alone does not resolve the issue of semantic content; it merely presupposes states already imbued with meaning: \"To be told that a state or structure has the semantic content that $P$ if it plays the same inferential role as my belief that $P$ plays in my cognitive economy is to leave one wondering what makes my neural structures play an inferential role or participate in a cognitive economy\" (Dretske 1983, p. 88, italics added).\\n\\nIt is evident, then, that two distinct notions of meaning or semantic content are at play in the debate between internalists and externalists. According to conceptual role semantics, content is identified by its computational or inferential role within the cognitive system. In contrast, correlational semantics identifies content through its causal or indicator relationship with the external world.\\n\\nTraditional symbolic artificial intelligence models of internal representation have primarily emphasized the internal component. For example, in a semantic network (e.g., Collins & Quillian, 1969), semantic contents are mainly identified with computational or inferential roles among internal symbol tokens. Conversely, connectionists, due to their focus on self-organized learning of internal representations, pay more attention to the relationship between a system\\'s internal states and its environmental inputs. This is why these models appear more closely related to indicational content.\\n\\nThis clear distinction, however, breaks down when considering actual research conducted in both areas. On one hand, researchers in symbolic AI, when addressing problems of vision or motor control, must also consider relations to external states and the adaptiveness of behavior. On the other hand, many connectionist models do not genuinely interact with a real environment but instead receive carefully preprocessed canonical encodings of the relevant stimulus domain (e.g., semantic features in sentence processing).\\n\\nBeyond these practical considerations, it is challenging to see how any account of the semantic content of internal representations could rely solely on either the correlational factor or the conceptual role. This realization has led to the development of various versions of so-called two-factor theories of meaning (Block 1986; McGinn, 1982). These theories attempt to reconcile the two separate components of meaning by integrating both the internal and external factors. The central challenge for any two-factor theory is to provide an account of how these two factors are systematically related.\\n\\nIn addressing this issue, Dretske\\'s (1988) recent proposal appears promising and may be applicable to connectionist approaches. In essence, Dretske has shifted from his earlier one-factor theory towards a two-factor theory. The primary component remains identified with causal or informational relations to the external states they indicate. It is now supplemented by a second component, through which Dretske not only acknowledges the interconnectedness of representations but also seeks to explain how and why this interconnectedness occurs. The basic idea is to consider interdependencies among internal indicator states (Dretske, 1988, pp. 150-156). A simple example would be a system that exploits covariations between environmental states and establishes associative links between the corresponding internal indicator structures. In such cases, internal structures can acquire new functions. According to Dretske, however, not every change in indication due to internal interconnections between indicator states results in a change of meaning. A change of meaning occurs only if the indicator function changes.\\n\\nIn summary, the central conclusion of this section is that it is insufficient to focus solely on the relationships between hidden units and the input patterns to which they selectively respond. Instead, it is essential to consider that internal states are interconnected. We will explore this point in more detail in the final section of this chapter, where we will argue that the interconnectivity among units in connectionist networks has significant implications for the question of semantic content. In the following section, however, we will shift our focus to discuss the problem of compositional representation.',\n"," '\\\\section*{The Argument for Strong Compositionality}\\n\\nThe core of Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s (1988) argument can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item **Productivity and Systematicity**: Our linguistic and mental representations are productive, meaning we can generate and comprehend an infinite number of utterances or thoughts. Additionally, language is systematic; understanding a word (e.g., \"loves\") in one sentence (e.g., \"John loves Mary\") implies the ability to understand it in various other sentences (e.g., \"Mary loves John\") that one may not have encountered before. Fodor and Pylyshyn extend this concept from language to the systematicity of thought.\\n\\n\\\\item **Constituency Structure**: To explain productivity and systematicity within a finite system, it is necessary to assume a generative mechanism that constructs complex symbols from simpler ones. Complex symbols have syntactic structures and consist of parts or constituents that are themselves symbols. Mental processes are structure-sensitive operations that work over these symbols based on their formal properties. Specifically, there must be a \"physical instantiation mapping\" that aligns atomic symbols with simple physical structures and complex expressions with complex physical structures, ensuring that causal relations between these structures are sensitive to the syntactic constituency of the symbols.\\n\\n\\\\item **Semantic Compositionality**: The meaning of complex expressions can be derived from the meanings of their constituent parts and their syntactic relationships.\\n\\n\\\\item **Context-Free Constituents**: Syntactic constituency structure explains semantic systematicity only if the meaning of any given constituent of a complex expression is context-independent. As Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988, p. 42) state, \"a lexical item must make approximately the same semantic contribution to each expression in which it occurs.\"\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\nFodor and Pylyshyn argue that connectionist networks inherently lack the capacity for true constituency structure and thus cannot adequately explain the systematicity of human language and thought. They illustrate this with examples of ultralocalist networks, where single nodes represent concepts or propositions. These networks, composed solely of atomic nodes and causal links, cannot exploit the formal equivalence of expressions. For instance, a network that infers $A \\\\& B$ to $A$ via a link between nodes representing $A \\\\& B$ and $A$ cannot generalize this to other inferences (e.g., $P \\\\& Q \\\\Rightarrow P$) because complex expressions like $(A \\\\& B)$ are represented by atomic nodes that lack structural relations to simpler expressions $(A, B)$.\\n\\nA similar issue arises in combining concepts into propositions. Consider a network encoding propositions through the simultaneous activation of concept lists (e.g., \"John loves Mary\" corresponds to activating nodes for JOHN, LOVES, and MARY). This representation is ambiguous about who loves whom due to the lack of syntactic structure, a version of the variable binding problem. Fodor and Pylyshyn suggest introducing additional nodes for roles like john-as-object and mary-as-subject. However, this solution is impractical, as it requires new nodes for each possible complex expression (e.g., distinguishing \"John loves Mary\" from \"Bill hates Sally\" would require nodes for features like BEING THE OBJECT of John\\'s loving). In contrast, classical symbol systems use constituents like Mary, John, and loves as literal parts of complex expressions, allowing for the generation of unlimited propositions.\\n\\nThere are two potential approaches to address this challenge. The first is to demonstrate that connectionist models can implement structured symbol systems. Proposals exist for implementing variable binding (Smolensky, 1987), production rules (Touretzky & Hinton, 1988), or semantic networks (Shastri & Feldman, 1986). However, this approach, while significant, would make the connectionist enterprise less revolutionary, as it would show that connectionist networks represent by implementing symbol systems, not as distinct architectures. The crucial question is not whether connectionist models can theoretically account for systematicity, but whether they can do so without being implementations of classical symbol systems.\\n\\nThe second, more radical response to Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s critique is to argue that strong compositionality is neither necessary nor desirable in connectionist networks. This involves demonstrating either: (a) that language and thought are not truly compositional in the strong sense described, or (b) that the apparent systematicity of language and thought can be better explained without assuming internal structures characterized by strong compositionality. In the remainder of this section, we will review empirical evidence challenging the strong compositionality principle. In the next section, we will explore how constraint satisfaction in distributed networks might offer an alternative framework for a form of weak compositionality.',\n"," '# Empirical Evidence Against Strong Compositionality\\n\\nThe central issue with the principle of strong compositionality, as derived from assumption 4 of our reconstruction of Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s argument, is the apparent context-sensitivity of meaning. Despite extensive empirical evidence from psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology highlighting contextual influences on the representation of complex concepts, Fodor and Pylyshyn only briefly address the problem of context-sensitivity. While a comprehensive review of this empirical literature is beyond the scope of this chapter, we aim to provide a balanced summary of representative findings. We will first explore context effects on concept structure and then discuss the comprehension of complex concepts.\\n\\nThree preliminary remarks are necessary to avoid misunderstandings. First, the notion of compositionality, as expressed by Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s semantic compositionality, is generally uncontroversial (cf. Partee, 1984; but see Schiffer, 1987). Our focus is on the combination of semantic compositionality and context-free constituents, which we term the strong compositionality principle.\\n\\nSecond, we interpret Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s (1988) argument for compositionality as an empirical claim about the nature of internal representation. They acknowledge that \"It\\'s uncertain exactly how compositional natural languages actually are (just as it\\'s uncertain exactly how systematic they are)\" (p. 42). Their point could be seen as a conceptual truth about representation, suggesting that systematicity might be a constitutive condition for ascribing representational states to organisms (Clark, 1988). We emphasize that our empirical review does not draw conclusions about this conceptual point. If thought is not systematic, we leave open whether this implies the absence of representational states or the need for alternative explanations of representation.\\n\\nThird, regarding the notion of a concept, there has been extensive debate about the relationship between psychological evidence and the nature of concepts (see the debate on \"What is a concept\" in Mind and Language, 1989). Critics have noted that conflating the epistemological with the metaphysical dimensions of concepts can lead to confusion. Rey (1983) argues that distinguishing how people use their knowledge to categorize objects from how things are correctly classified is crucial. In this paper, we use the term concept descriptively to denote subjective representations of categories, focusing on the knowledge structures people use for categorization and typicality judgments. From this perspective, we evaluate Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s empirical claim that conceptual combination involves computing a complex meaning from context-free constituent meanings.\\n\\n## Context Effects and the Instability of Concept Structure\\n\\nThe first set of findings concerns the instability of concept structures. Since Rosch\\'s work (Rosch, 1973, 1975; cf. Rips, Shoben, & Smith, 1973), it is widely accepted that categories are not represented by necessary and sufficient features, but exemplars vary continuously on a typicality dimension (e.g., a canary is a more typical bird than a vulture). Consequently, alternative accounts of concepts, such as prototypes, family resemblances, or stored exemplars, have gained interest (Smith & Medin, 1981).\\n\\nCrucially, typicality is not a stable property of concepts but is highly context-dependent. Early demonstrations of context-dependency in category representations come from sentence memory studies. For example, Barclay et al. (1974) showed that cues like \"heavy\" were more effective than \"nice sounding\" in helping subjects recall the sentence \"The man lifted the piano,\" while the reverse was true for \"The man tuned the piano.\" Subjects encoded different aspects of the category \"piano\" in different contexts. Roth and Shoben (1983) found that decision times for categorizing instances (e.g., cow) were influenced by sentence context. For example, in \"Peter was milking the animal,\" decision latencies for \"cow\" were faster than for \"horse,\" but the reverse was true in \"Peter was riding the animal.\" Typicality was context-dependent and could not be predicted from typicality ratings without context.\\n\\nBarsalou (1987, 1989) reviews numerous cases of concept structure instability. Typicality judgments varied across subject populations (undergraduates vs. faculty), among subjects from the same population, and even for one subject in different sessions. Similar results were found when subjects generated properties of category exemplars (Barsalou, 1989) or judged exemplar membership (McCloskey & Glucksberg, 1978). Barsalou (1987) concludes that graded structures do not reflect invariant category properties. Instead, concepts are constructed from long-term memory knowledge, sensitive to context and recent experience. Similar conclusions apply to script knowledge retrieval (Walker & Kintsch, 1985), concept use in judgment tasks (Kahneman & Miller, 1986), and continuous associations to category terms (Strube, 1984).\\n\\nA plausible explanation for concept structure instability is that linguistic and pragmatic contexts selectively influence the accessibility of knowledge about a category. Category representation reflects not the retrieval of a fixed concept but the construction of a context-dependent, perspectivally filtered representation (Strube, 1984).\\n\\nThe stage at which contextual information influences comprehension remains unresolved (cf. Frauenfelder & Tyler, 1987; Tanenhaus & Lucas, 1987; Marslen-Wilson, 1987). Cross-modal priming experiments investigate context effects, where subjects listen to sentences with ambiguous prime words (e.g., \"bug\"). After the prime word, a visually presented target word may relate to either prime meaning (e.g., \"insect\" or \"micro\"). Facilitation effects on lexical decision times indicate prime meaning activation. Swinney (1979) found that both meanings of an ambiguous word are initially activated, even if the sentence context suggests only one reading.\\n\\nThese results support the view that early lexical access stages are modular, uninfluenced by contextual knowledge or expectations (cf. Fodor, 1983; Seidenberg et al., 1982; Seidenberg, 1985). However, recent studies with non-ambiguous words show different results. Tabossi (1988) used sentences like \"In the light, the blond hair of the little girl had the luster of gold,\" where a specific aspect of the final word\\'s meaning (e.g., \"gold\") was primed (e.g., the feature \"yellow\"). Lexical decisions for \"yellow\" were fastest after the priming context and slowest after a context priming a different aspect of \"gold.\" The sentential context selectively activated specific word meaning aspects (cf. Tabossi, 1989).\\n\\nZwitserlood (1989) provided direct evidence on context effect loci by presenting visual target words at different points before and during the prime word in spoken sentences. The priming effects suggest an early autonomous lexical access stage, where several word candidates compatible with sensory input are activated. However, context influenced item selection at a stage where sensory input alone was insufficient to choose among candidates. Context effects could not be explained by intralexical associations alone, suggesting higher-level semantic context influences lexical access early (cf. Marslen-Wilson & Tyler, 1987).\\n\\nIn summary, the findings suggest that category representation varies with present and past contexts. Concepts are transient memory structures constructed on the fly from long-term memory knowledge (Barsalou, 1987, 1989). The information integrated into a category representation depends on long-term memory accessibility. Pragmatic, semantic, and lexical contexts, as well as perspectives, goals, and intentions, modulate knowledge accessibility for category representation construction. While certain features may be context-independent, they alone do not account for word meaning construction (cf. Barsalou, 1982; Greenspan, 1986; Whitney et al., 1985).\\n\\n## The Comprehension of Complex Concepts\\n\\nIf lexical item conceptual representation varies across contexts, how is complex expression meaning constructed from constituent meanings? As speakers/hearers usually understand complex concepts or sentences effortlessly, some compositionality seems necessary. The question is whether strong compositionality, as endorsed by Fodor and Pylyshyn, adequately describes how people comprehend complex concepts. Due to limited space, we focus mainly on complex concept comprehension and briefly discuss sentence comprehension.\\n\\nEarly accounts of conceptual combination viewed complex concept extension as the intersection of simple concept extensions. However, extensional accounts seem inadequate as psychological theories (see Murphy, 1988; Osherson & Smith, 1981), leading to a focus on intensional explanations. The first observation demonstrating conceptual combination flexibility is that complex concept instance typicality often cannot be predicted from simple concept typicality (Osherson & Smith, 1981; Hampton, 1987). For example, a guppy is typical for a pet fish but is neither typical for a fish nor a pet. Such cases cannot be explained by simply computing the sum or average of constituent concept typicality values. Several authors (Hampton, 1988; Smith & Osherson, 1984; Smith et al., 1988) suggest that complex concept meaning is constructed based on the internal featural structure of combined concepts. In their \"Selective Modification Model,\" Smith et al. (1988) view nouns as schema-like entities with slots (dimensions) and fillers (values). A concept is represented as a list of values for each dimension. For instance, the concept \"apple\" may include values \"red\" 0.25, \"GREEN\" 0.5 on the color dimension and \"round\" 0.15, \"cylindrical\" 0.5 on the shape dimension. Dimensions differ in diagnosticity, meaning certain dimensions are more important for categorization. When an adjective combines with a noun (e.g., \"red apple\"), the adjective changes or adds a value on one or more feature dimensions (e.g., \"RED\" 0.5) and increases the diagnosticity of the relevant dimension (e.g., the dimension \"COLOR\" receives more weight for \"RED APPLE\" than for \"APPLE\").\\n\\nAlthough the modification model accounts for typicality judgments under various conditions (e.g., Smith, 1987; Smith & Osherson, 1984), recent results suggest a more flexible way of computing complex concept meaning is needed. The assumption that different feature dimensions are independent has been challenged. For instance, Medin and Shoben (1988) found that subjects rated small spoons as more typical spoons than large spoons, but this relation reversed for wooden spoons. Similarly, adjective similarity was influenced by noun context: \"white hair\" and \"gray hair\" are more similar than \"gray hair\" and \"black hair,\" but \"white clouds\" and \"gray clouds\" are less similar than \"gray clouds\" and \"black clouds.\" These results show that feature dimensions are not processed independently; a change on one dimension affects values on others.\\n\\nMurphy (1988) found that modifier effects on nouns differ depending on the noun modified, meaning the same adjective changes values on different dimensions with different nouns. Furthermore, adjective meaning heavily depends on the modified noun (e.g., \"long\" means \"seeming to pass slowly\" with \"year,\" \"lasting for years\" with \"life,\" \"expressed in complete sentences\" with \"hand\"; see also Lahav, 1989, for noncompositionality in adjectives). Salient modifier features were not necessarily true of adjective-noun combinations (e.g., \"PAINTED GREEN\" was probable for \"green bicycles\" but not for \"bicycles\" or \"green things\" in general). HÃ¶rmann (1983) showed that implicit quantifier meaning (e.g., \"a few\" or \"some\") depends on object size or frequency, relation to neighboring objects, and viewpoint. For instance, subjects estimated \"a few people\" as more people when imagined through a window than through a small hole.\\n\\nThese results demonstrate that in combining concepts, people do not treat featural dimensions as independent. Instead, they rely on complex covariation patterns among attributes derived from general world knowledge. This result challenges the Selective Modification Model\\'s assumptions: (a) each adjective has a similar effect regardless of the noun it modifies, and (b) no further world knowledge intrudes in conceptual combination (cf. Murphy, 1988, p. 534).\\n\\nWhile results from conceptual combination studies cannot be generalized simply to sentence comprehension, recent evidence suggests similar conclusions for sentence comprehension. Investigations of on-line sentence processing show that sentence meaning construction is sensitive to informational constraints (world knowledge, pragmatics, semantics, syntax) like conceptual combination. Different information sources are effective at different comprehension process points (Strube et al., 1989), suggesting sentence meaning construction results from parallel interaction of several knowledge sources (e.g., Marslen-Wilson & Tyler, 1980, 1987). The flexibility and context-dependence of conceptual combination impose severe constraints on sentence comprehension theories, challenging strong compositionality (see Clark, 1983, for further argument against compositionality of sentence meaning).',\n"," '\\\\section*{Alternative Explanations of Context-Sensitivity}\\n\\nSeveral interpretations have been proposed to reconcile the results on context-sensitivity with strong compositionality (see Lahav, 1989; Murphy, 1988, for related discussions).\\n\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item The Ambiguity Strategy: One of the least convincing attempts to preserve strong compositionality is to interpret cases like those discussed in previous sections not as instances of context-sensitivity, but as examples of true ambiguity. Instead of viewing the context-dependent nuances of the word \"LONG\" as variations in meaning, this approach suggests that different interpretations of \"LONG\" in phrases like \"LONG YEAR\" and \"LONG HAND\" reflect the selection of distinct lexical entries, each context-free and compositional. However, this proposal is cumbersome given the widespread occurrence of context effects and the subtle gradations of meaning often found in discourse. Furthermore, the ambiguity strategy fails to explain why concepts, despite their context-sensitivity, seem to share commonalities across different contexts. In essence, interpreting context-sensitivity as ambiguity obscures the systematicity that initially motivated the assumption of context-free meanings.\\n\\n\\\\item The Syncategorematicity Strategy: Another approach to maintain compositionality in the face of context effects was initially proposed by Ziff (1960) and later adopted by Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988). This strategy involves incorporating variables into the meanings of lexical items, which are then filled with information from the context. According to Fodor and Pylyshyn, a \"good knife\" is a knife that meets specific interests related to knives, while a \"good car\" satisfies interests related to cars.\\n\\nAs Lahav (1989) convincingly argued, this approach merely shifts the problem of context-dependence to a deeper level. He questions how the syncategorematicity strategy could be applied to cases like \"red.\" To suggest that \"red\" means \"red in the manner and in the parts whose color is most interesting or salient in this type of object\" (Lahav, 1989, p. 267) is unhelpful because what is interesting or salient about an object seems to be as noun-dependent as \"red\" itself. The parts of a bird that are most salient with respect to color, and thus need to be red for the bird to be considered red, differ from those in a crystal. Moreover, objects vary in the salience of their parts concerning color, and there seems to be no context-independent way to define what makes an object or its part salient or interesting.\\n\\n\\\\item The Pragmatics Strategy: The final strategy to reconcile context effects with compositionality discussed here is to consider context effects as irrelevant to semantics and instead categorize them under pragmatics. In this view, \"red $X$,\" strictly speaking, would have a context-free meaning, such as \"having a red surface.\" Objects we call red but do not meet this condition (e.g., red birds, red books) would not truly be red. However, as Lahav (1989) has argued, this leads to the counterintuitive conclusion that most sentences we use and understand without issue are actually false. Additionally, the motivation for assuming context-free meanings was to explain systematicity. Shifting the problem of context-dependency to pragmatics does not simplify the explanation of systematicity in the presence of context effects any more than rejecting the notion of context-free meanings altogether.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}',\n"," '\\\\section*{Constraint Satisfaction, Context-Sensitivity, and Weak Compositionality}\\n\\nConstraint satisfaction is a powerful approach for solving problems that require the simultaneous processing of numerous partially incompatible pieces of information. This method has been utilized in models of word sense disambiguation (Waltz & Pollack, 1985), belief revision, explanatory coherence (Thagard, 1989), and knowledge representation (Rumelhart, Smolensky, McClelland, & Hinton, 1986). The empirical evidence reviewed in the previous section strongly suggests that the comprehension of complex concepts similarly relies on the simultaneous processing of information from various sources, including syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and world knowledge.\\n\\nIn the context of constraint satisfaction networks, it is useful to think of units as hypotheses, activation values as degrees of confidence in a given hypothesis, and connections between units as constraints (cf. Smolensky, 1988). For example, consider a positive connection between two units: one indicating SPOONS and the other indicating the feature SMALL. This connection can be interpreted as the constraint that when one unit is \"on\" (i.e., when a SPOON is present), the other should also be \"on\" (i.e., the network \"assumes\" SPOONS to be SMALL). If both units are \"on,\" the constraint is satisfied. Conversely, if only one is \"on\" and the other is \"off,\" the constraint is violated. For each possible state of the network, one can define the degree to which all its constraints are satisfied simultaneously. This measure of global coherence is sometimes termed energy. The more constraints that are satisfied, the lower the network\\'s energy. It has been shown (Hopfield, 1982) that under certain assumptions, a network tends to minimize this energy function. The network performs a gradient descent in state space until it settles into a local minimum of the energy function, a stable state that satisfies as many constraints as possible compared to its neighboring points.\\n\\nWhen presented with an input from a certain category (e.g., a vowel in a speech segment), the network will settle into a particular activation pattern over the hidden units. Such a pattern of activation can be conceived as a point in an n-dimensional state space, with each unit defining a dimension. When a network has learned to make a certain discrimination, its state space is partitioned into more or less distinct regions. When an exemplar of a given category (e.g., a vowel) is presented, the network approaches points in a certain region of its state space, whereas inputs from a different category (e.g., consonants) cause the network to settle into a different region. The partitions of the network\\'s state space thus correspond to the categories the network has learned to discriminate (see Churchland, 1989, for a lucid exposition of this picture).\\n\\nWhen the input consists of linguistic items, the resulting activation state can be conceived as a representation of a \"scenario\" that is maximally coherent given the constraints imposed by the input and the internal connectivity of the network. When the input is a complex expression, meaning the linguistic item is embedded in the context of a larger expression, both the item and its context impose constraints on the network and influence which stable state the network converges to. The construction of the meaning of a complex expression thus corresponds to the process by which the network settles into a stable attractor state when it receives a complex expression as input.\\n\\nThis general framework can be illustrated by the model of sentence comprehension by McClelland and Kawamoto (1986). The model\\'s task was to assign thematic roles (e.g., AGENT, PATIENT, INSTRUMENT) to the constituents of input sentences. Words were represented as lists of micro-features, which were not too \"micro\" but consisted of relatively molar dimensions like volume, breakability, and softness. The model\\'s output consisted of activation patterns over different sets of so-called role units. There was one set of units for each thematic role (agent, patient, etc.). Units within a set represented semantic microfeatures (e.g., activation of the microfeature SOFT in the set of AGENT units would represent the interpretation that the AGENT of the input sentence has the property of being SOFT). The binding of fillers to roles was more complex and was based on Smolensky\\'s (1987) proposal for a tensor product method of connectionist variable binding. During training, pairs of input sentences and correct case-role representations were presented to the network, and the connection weights were adjusted according to the perceptron convergence procedure (Rosenblatt, 1962). After training, the model could correctly map input sentences to case-role representations and showed some degree of generalization to new sentences. In accomplishing this task, the model used semantic information (covariation patterns among microfeatures) and word order cues (in cases where semantic information alone was insufficient for a unique case role assignment). Furthermore, an elaboration of the model (St. John & McClelland, 1988) using sequential networks (Jordan, 1986) is a promising attempt to model aspects of the time course of sentence interpretation and account for the online character of sentence comprehension (cf. Strube et al., 1989; Marslen-Wilson, 1987).\\n\\nAlthough the case role assignment model may be criticized in several respects (e.g., concerning the choice of microfeatures, the degree of generalization, and the restricted ability of the model to deal with complex syntactic structures and recursive embeddings; cf. Lachtor & Bever, 1988; Strube, in press), we would like to emphasize several points.\\n\\nFirst, contrary to Fodor and Pylyshyn\\'s (1988) contention, the model demonstrates how constraint satisfaction in distributed networks may account for the combination of simple concepts into complex ones. The mapping of novel word strings to a conceptual representation in terms of thematic roles seems to be a paradigmatic example of constructing a complex concept. We see no reason in principle why models of this kind should not be said to exhibit a weak form of compositionality in the sense that they assign conceptual interpretations to complex expressions they have not encountered before. It must be admitted that it is an open question as to what degree of productivity such networks can achieve based on statistical inference and generalization. Profound skepticism has been expressed regarding the generalization capabilities of connectionist networks. However, recent simulation experiments have demonstrated that the generalization capacity of connectionist models dramatically increases when the items to be learned belong to a combinatorially structured domain (Brousse & Smolensky, 1990). We will return to the question of unlimited productivity in the final section of the chapter.\\n\\nSecondly, despite their capacity to account for compositionality in a weak sense, it would be seriously misleading to regard models based on constraint satisfaction as mere implementations of strong compositionality. In contrast to the principle of strong compositionality, the meanings of the constituents are \"shaded\" in a context-sensitive way to maximize the overall coherence of the resulting complex meaning. Context-sensitivity arises from two sources. On the one hand, the external context input in which a given linguistic item is embedded will change the form of the energy function defined over the network\\'s states and will thus modulate the stable state to which the network converges. Another important, but less frequently discussed, source of context sensitivity stems from the fact that hidden units do not receive activation only from input units but also from inside the network (cf. Churchland, 1989). As a consequence, the response to a given input (e.g., a word) will vary more or less with the current internal context input.\\n\\nConsider a frequently cited example from McClelland and Kawamoto (1986). When their model processed the sentence \"the ball broke the vase,\" it assigned the feature HARD to the agent BALL, although during learning it had only been confronted with balls that were soft. This shading of meaning was due to the fact that all the things the model had encountered as things that break something had been hard. The model thus generalizes the covariation between things that break something and hardness to new cases. This kind of holistic processing of covariation patterns among featural dimensions based on knowledge acquired from previous experience seems to be precisely what the results of Medin and Shoben (1988), Murphy (1988), Barsalou (1987), and others reviewed earlier demand. Constraint satisfaction thus provides the kind of sensitivity to different informational sources required to account for how people construct the meaning of expressions in different contexts. To employ one of the examples of Medin and Shoben (1988), when a network has learned that WOODEN SPOONS are typically large, but the reverse is true for SILVER SPOONS, this covariation among features will be encoded in the internal connectivity of the network. A large silver spoon would thus violate certain constraints and therefore count as a less typical exemplar of the category SILVER SPOON compared to a little SILVER SPOON. In general, there seems to be no principled limit to the amount of general knowledge about regularities between objects and events in the world that serves to constrain the process of conceptual combination. To conclude, we suggest that conceptual combination is the process by which a network converges to that point in conceptual space that satisfies as many constraints as possible, where constraints are imposed both by the input expressions and the internal connectivity of the network.',\n"," '# Representation of Structure Versus Structured Representation\\n\\nTo assess how the previous discussion might address the issues raised by Fodor and Pylyshyn, it\\'s crucial to clarify what constraint satisfaction models can and cannot achieve. Firstly, it\\'s important to note that these models do not implement strong compositionality due to the context dependency of distributed representations. The common metaphor of these networks \"shading\" the meanings of words might not be sufficiently radical. In some models, like the McClelland-Kawamoto model, it is possible to identify units dedicated to specific thematic roles. However, in genuinely self-organizing models, this may not be the case. The composite state into which a network relaxes might not allow for the determination of which substate corresponds to a given shaded input constituent. Thus, while the network arrives at an interpretation of a complex expression, the internal state representing this interpretation may not clearly decompose into parts that straightforwardly correspond to the meanings of the input expression\\'s components. Consequently, we agree with Fodor and Pylyshyn that such networks do not exhibit the syntactic constituency structure characteristic of classical architectures. The question then is what this implies for the ability of constraint satisfaction models to account for natural language comprehension.\\n\\nIn a 1990 paper commenting on Smolensky (1987), Fodor and McLaughlin explicitly claimed that distributed representations do not better account for systematicity than the localist networks critiqued by Fodor and Pylyshyn. For Fodor and McLaughlin, the context sensitivity of constituent vectors in Smolensky\\'s approach suggests that \"constituents don\\'t contribute their contents to the symbols they belong to\" (p. 191), or at least that \"we are given no clue at all about what sorts of relations between the semantic properties of complex symbols and the semantic properties of their constituents his theory acknowledges\" (p. 197).\\n\\nHowever, we believe that the inference from the context dependency of internal representations to the impossibility of semantic productivity in external languages may not be conclusive. The lack of true syntactic constituency structure in constraint satisfaction models does not necessarily mean that simple expressions \"don\\'t contribute their contents\" to the interpretation of complex expressions. Nor does the inability to clearly decompose the representation of a complex expression into parts imply that it is impossible to specify the relations between the meanings of simple and complex expressions. Instead, constraint satisfaction models suggest that the relationship between the meanings of simple linguistic items and the interpretation of complex expressions may be more intricate than previously thought.\\n\\nWe propose integrating correlational semantics, as discussed earlier, with a constraint satisfaction approach to comprehension. In local representation, the semantic content of a hidden unit can be seen as its function of indication relative to a desired input-output mapping. In distributed networks, sets of units, rather than single units, are the primary objects of semantic interpretation. Concepts correspond to partitions of the network\\'s state space, where inputs from the same category cause the network to settle into neighboring states. The distance between points in state space reflects a multivariate measure of similarity of the corresponding inputs.\\n\\nApplying the correlational approach to semantic content in distributed representation, we can define the indicational content of a point in state space based on its correlation with input category exemplars. Since not every exemplar of a category will lead to the same activation pattern, it may be more precise to define indicational content with regard to sets of points within a region. The indicational content of a region in state space is defined by a multivariate measure of the correlation between the set of points in a region and sets of input exemplars. The distinction between indicational and representational content applies here as well. The representational content of a region in state space is the function of indication of that region.\\n\\nAs described earlier, when the network receives a complex expression as input, each input item imposes constraints on the network, modulating it into the stable attractor state. It is an empirical question how transparent the relations will be between the meanings (i.e., the indicator functions) of states corresponding to simple inputs and those corresponding to complex expressions. In some cases, these relations may be described straightforwardly, perhaps along the lines of the selective modification model of Smith et al. (1988). However, it is possible that in many cases, these relations will be more complex. In extreme cases, the simplest and most precise way to describe the relation between simple and complex meanings may be in terms of the network\\'s actual connectivity. Even if this more complex picture proves true, it does not imply that there is no relation between the meanings of simple and complex concepts.\\n\\nThis sketch does not provide a systematic semantic theory for distributed representations. However, we hope it serves as a starting point for developing such a theory. Integrating correlational semantics with a constraint satisfaction account of conceptual combination offers a general framework for formulating precise, empirically based accounts of semantic content in distributed networks. Issues such as the exact kind of correlation and similarity metric to be used can only be decided based on empirical evidence, some of which we reviewed in this paper. Notably, this proposal aligns well with traditional dimensional accounts of concept structure, which have explained much empirical evidence on concept representation (cf. Smith & Medin, 1981). Constraint satisfaction may thus allow for developing performance models of conceptual combination that integrate well with traditional theories of conceptual structure.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our fundamental disagreement with Fodor and Pylyshyn is that we believe it is possible to explain the ability to understand an arbitrary number of complex expressions without attributing the constituency structure of external symbol systems to the internal representations underlying their use. Representing structured entities may not require representations that replicate the structure of the represented entities (cf. van Gelder, 1990). While external symbol systems like language may be characterized by syntactic constituency structure, this need not be the case for the internal representations underlying the capacity to use such systems. Instead, it may suffice to assume a coupling of external symbol tokens (e.g., written words) with internal distributed representations of concepts. Imagine that whenever a network settles into a point in state space corresponding to a given category, it writes the corresponding natural language expression on a computer screen (e.g., when presented with an example of a spoon, it writes \"spoon\" on the screen). Observing the network\\'s behavior from the outside, we would notice that it reliably labels instances of spoons as spoons. However, nothing within the network can be identified with an internal symbol token having the meaning \"SPOON.\" Rather than the tokening of an internal symbol, it is the network\\'s connectivity and the covariational patterns encoded in it that underlie its ability to categorize objects and use external symbols. Similarly, when presented with a complex symbolic expression, the network settles into a state representing a coherent interpretation of the input. It is not necessary to assume that instances of the same external symbol lead to the same internal state on different occasions or that a complex symbol leads to an internal state consisting of parts corresponding to the input expression\\'s constituents.\\n\\nIn this view, there is no representation of fixed meanings associated with each word form in the lexicon. What remains relatively stable and context-free are the external symbol tokens (the word forms) and the connectivity between word forms and the conceptual network. Constructing complex meanings may not involve retrieving and combining fixed concepts but is determined by the connectivity between word forms and the conceptual network.\\n\\nWe conclude by referencing the image of meaning and understanding presented by psycholinguist Hans Hörmann about fifteen years ago, which anticipated many of the present conclusions before the renaissance of connectionist models. Hörmann (1976, 1983) questioned the assumption that the meaning of an utterance is computed from the context-free meanings of its constituents according to a fixed set of syntactic rules. Instead, he proposed that the meaning of an utterance is strongly dependent on one\\'s knowledge of the world and the current context. Consequently, Hörmann advocated abandoning the compositionality principle, although he did not provide explicit alternative explanations for the systematic nature of language comprehension. Nevertheless, his conjecture that the elements of an utterance function as \"constraints of the cognitive space\" (Hörmann, 1983, p. 34) and that understanding is a process \"which adjusts and changes the meaning of the utterance as a whole until the hearer accepts the result as intelligible\" (Hörmann, 1983, p. 52) aligns well with recent developments in distributed connectionism.',\n"," '\\\\section*{8 Representation in Perception and Cognition: Connectionist Affordances}\\n\\nThe concept of representation in cognitive science is a topic of ongoing debate. Traditionally, many researchers have equated representations with symbols, viewing them as syntactically defined elements within an internal symbol system (see Fodor, 1975; Pylyshyn, 1984). Some have advocated for understanding representation solely in these terms (Fodor, 1980; Stich, 1983, chap. 8), while others have implicitly supported this perspective (Newell & Simon, 1976; Newell, 1980). Recently, two significant challenges have emerged against this traditional view. \\n\\nFirst, several philosophers have argued for a classical understanding of \"representation,\" emphasizing its role as a \"stands for\" relation between the representation and what is represented. This perspective is shared by philosophers both outside the symbolist tradition (Dretske, 1988; Hatfield, 1988b; Searle, 1983) and within it (Fodor, 1987). Second, the rise of connectionism has posed a growing challenge to the orthodox view of representation (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986b; Smolensky, 1988). Although this connectionist challenge has provoked strong reactions from proponents of the symbolist approach (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; Pinker & Prince, 1988), connectionists have yet to fully articulate a new conception of representation to replace the symbolist view. Nonetheless, most connectionists agree on the necessity of a nonsymbolic notion of representation (Feldman & Ballard, 1982; Hinton, McClelland, & Rumelhart, 1986; Smolensky, 1988; see also Kosslyn & Hatfield, 1984).\\n\\nIn this paper, I aim to advocate for treating the \"stands for\" sense of representation as primary, integrating it into a broader approach to cognitive science that aligns with the connectionist challenge to traditional symbolism. The central idea is to combine connectionism with a specific version of functionalism, one that bases its concept of \"function\" on the similarities between functional analysis in biology and psychology. I will build upon previous work (Kosslyn & Hatfield, 1984; Hatfield, 1988a, 1988b) that adapts and revises Marr\\'s (1982) tri-level approach to cognition. My proposal liberates Marr\\'s analysis from its ties to the traditional symbolic view of representation and aligns it with a notion of functional analysis similar to that proposed by Cummins (1975), further developed by Haugeland (1978), and utilized by Millikan (1984) and Dretske (1988). Unlike these authors, however, I do not link the notion of representation to a general belief-desire analysis of behavior. Instead, I follow what I perceive to be the lesson of psychological practice, where the investigator seeks to analyze the cognitive capacities underlying behavior, such as vision, memory, learning, and linguistic abilities, rather than explaining behavior in general. In this view, representational content is ascribed not by deducing from belief-desire ascriptions but within the context of developing psychological models to account for specific cognitive capacities.\\n\\nSince conceptions of representation in cognitive science are typically embedded within a broader approach to studying cognition, arguments for the plausibility of a particular conception of representation must consider these larger frameworks. Therefore, I begin by outlining the interrelated assumptions that underpin the traditional symbolist approach, focusing on the complementarity between representation and process that naturally arises from these assumptions. I then examine two alternative approaches to representation: Dretske\\'s (1988) and my own. Finally, I advocate for the \"cognitive capacities\" approach over the \"belief-desire\" approach in addressing the subject matter of cognitive science.',\n"," '# The Orthodox Conception of Representations as Symbols\\n\\nThe orthodox view of representations as symbols is often acknowledged, yet the underlying assumptions are not as widely recognized. This is surprising, given the availability of several clear expositions of the symbolist perspective (Fodor, 1975, chap. 1; Haugeland, 1985, chap. 2; Newell, 1980; Newell, Rosenbloom, & Laird, 1989; Pylyshyn, 1984, 1989). These works clarify that the symbolist conception of representation is rooted in an analogy with computational processes in digital computers. The core idea is that symbols are defined by their form, which is determined by the processes that operate over them. These processes are rule-governed; symbol tokens are considered \"formally different\" if the system of rules governing their manipulation distinguishes them as such. Symbols and the rules for their combination and recombination define a symbol system, with natural and artificial languages serving as paradigm examples.\\n\\nIn cognitive science, researchers are often interested in physically instantiated symbol systems. This interest extends to artificial objects like computers, designed to instantiate a symbol system, and natural organisms like humans and other animals, which are hypothesized to have evolved to instantiate a physical symbol system. In this theoretical context, the digital computer exemplifies a device where the causal interactions among physical instantiations of symbols correspond to rule-permitted translations among syntactically characterized strings of symbols. This provides a clear example of a physically instantiated symbol system, offering a way to understand how a system of rules and symbolic representations could be physically instantiated. The existence of such devices suggests that the mind-body problem is not insoluble (Putnam, 1967, 1975; Fodor, 1975, Introduction).\\n\\nPutnam, Fodor, and other \"functionalist\" cognitive scientists proposed the intriguing possibility that psychological processes in humans and other animals might be similar to those in computers. In its most general formulation (Block, 1980), this \"functionalist\" approach posits that the behavior of complex organisms is a function of input, output, and interactions among internal, functionally characterized states. These states are defined by their interactions with one another and with input and output devices (such as sensory transducers and organs of motion). This position is not fundamentally different from liberal versions of behaviorism that allowed functionally defined intervening variables (Hull, 1943; Tolman, 1936). What made the functionalist approach exciting was the claim that the internal states now posited were more appropriate for explaining cognition than behaviorist intervening variables. The arguments for this claim emphasized that the newly posited internal states were conceived as elements in a symbol system and hence were language-like, providing an appropriate medium for cognitive operations such as rational choice, concept learning, and object recognition. Fodor (1975, chap. 1) argued that the ability to perform such operations could only be explained by positing an internal language of thought.\\n\\nThe development of connectionist models has challenged Fodor\\'s argument by undermining his claim (1975, p. 55) that computation cannot occur without symbols. Nonetheless, the symbolic paradigm remains influential in cognitive science. Researchers posited that organisms contain an internal symbol system because it was believed that powerful psychological explanations would become possible. Computers can perform complex tasks (i.e., complicated transformations between input and output), and their operation can be described as symbol handling; it was thought that organisms might perform their complex information-handling tasks similarly.\\n\\nThe core of the symbolist approach can be revealed by considering an objection that has been addressed: the objection that positing an internal symbol system leads to an infinite regress. The charge is that internal symbol systems are posited to explain complex information-handling abilities, such as natural-language abilities. However, one must ascribe to the machinery that manipulates these internal symbols the ability to \"read\" and respond to them appropriately, which are the abilities that required positing an internal symbol system for their explanation. Thus, the abilities of the internal machinery would require positing yet another internal symbol system, and so on. The response to this charge varies, but the basic scheme is the same: some primitive abilities for \"reading\" and manipulating symbols must be ascribed to the organism or device. Fodor (1975, pp. 65-66) responded to this charge by appealing to the computer metaphor: just as a computer must be built to respond to some symbolic inputs—its CPU must be hardwired to perform some primitive symbolic manipulations, out of which all other abilities are constructed—so too the organism comes ready-built with a primitive language of thought (a set of symbols and built-in rules for manipulating them). Others speak of \"primitive\" capacities for symbol manipulation (Haugeland, 1985, chap. 2; Pylyshyn, 1989) or of physically instantiated symbols having causal interactions with other symbol tokens by virtue of their physical properties (Stich, 1983, pp. 149-151). In either case, appeal is made to causal properties of symbols that do not depend on their being read as symbols but on their brute physical properties and the physical structure of the entity in which they are instantiated. These causal properties explain how symbol tokens interact with one another.\\n\\nConsidering a second line of criticism reinforces the point that functionalist models in cognitive science should be viewed as imputing a specific internal architecture to organisms. This objection contends that the symbol system hypothesis is vacuous because, under a relevant description, anything can be a symbol. For instance, one could work out a code using the arrangement of differently colored bricks in a building by mapping brick colors to words and directing the message receiver to the sequence of bricks in a particular row; the bricks are the symbols, and the mapping provides the key to the code. One could even use the same row of bricks to represent different messages by altering the key. But, the objection goes, if bricks can be symbols, and the same brick can be one symbol now and another later, then the symbol system hypothesis is so unconstrained as to be without content. This objection has been formalized by Putnam (1988, Appendix), who concludes that functionalism is either vacuous or reduces to behaviorism. Putnam proves a theorem intended to show that \"there is a sense in which everything has every functional organization\" (p. xv). The theorem states that \"Every ordinary open system is a realization of every abstract finite automaton\" (p. 121). Its proof involves demarcating well-defined physical states of the system within sharp temporal boundaries and then defining appropriate disjunctions of such states as a sequence of machine states. As one changes the definition of machine states in terms of physical states, one changes the automaton realized by the sequence of physical states. Putnam acknowledges that this proof does not argue against the sorts of \"functionally characterized\" systems studied in cognitive science, where the \"function\" computed is constrained at the input and output end by the states of sensors and motor organs. However, he proposes an extension of the original proof, according to which all systems behaving as if they were computing a given function may be imputed the function, concluding that possessing a given functional organization reduces to possessing a behavioral disposition, thus reducing functionalism to behaviorism.\\n\\nIn my view, Putnam\\'s argument does not show that functionalism is vacuous, but it illustrates an important point: In symbol-system versions of functionalism, the description of certain states of a device as \"symbols\" is always made relative to the specification of rules for transitions among symbolically defined states and relative to a specific functional architecture for implementing those rules. The dependence on a framework of rules (or \"symbolic practices\") is a general constraint on symbol ascription, but the appeal to a device- or organism-specific functional architecture is not. In the case of natural languages, certain inscriptions and sound patterns are treated as symbols in a language (say, words or sentences) relative to a linguistic community. In the case of the \"brick code,\" individuals stipulate that they will treat certain objects or events as symbols; in artificial languages, the domain of legal symbols and operations over those symbols may be explicitly defined. In these instances, the rationale for calling something a \"symbol\" depends on the conventions adhered to or adopted by a group of users. In Putnam\\'s example, anything can be made to seem organized as a symbol processor, but discerning this functional organization requires an act of stipulation. In the case of the symbol systems imputed to organisms by symbol-systems functionalists, what counts as a symbol is not supposed to depend on convention or stipulation but is alleged to be a natural-scientific fact about how certain types of organisms—those with a certain functional architecture—are built. Although \"everything\" might have every functional architecture in the stipulative sense described by Putnam, the symbofunctionalist maintains that some things naturally have an internal organization in which some states are symbols (where \"natural\" is defined by imputing a particular biological function to the parts of an organism).\\n\\nIf the symbol systems approach is not to become vacuous, strong constraints must be found for deciding which internal states count as symbols and which sequences of events count as the mechanisms for \"reading\" and \"interpreting\" those symbols (in the computer-science sense of \"interpretation\": being caused to go into the next machine state). Symbolists like Pylyshyn, recognizing the need for such constraints, have proposed that imputing a specific functional architecture to a given system must include concrete proposals about the internal organization of the system, proposals that could be tested by making inferences from the real-time behavior of the device on various tasks (Pylyshyn, 1984, chap. 4; 1989). In a digital computer, this functional architecture is defined by the type of CPU, clock speed, amount of internal memory, and so on; the wiring of the CPU, in particular, determines the basic \"symbol reading\" operations of that machine, in relation to which its other symbolic abilities must be defined. In imputing an internal symbol system to an organism, the symbofunctionalist is (ideally) making a concrete proposal about the internal workings of that organism. Symbofunctionalist models must claim to provide an empirically plausible functional decomposition of the workings of an organism or group of organisms. To the extent that this decomposition is confirmed by empirical tests that can discriminate among different functional architectures, it will make sense to be a scientific realist about symbofunctionalism. (Of course, it is still possible—indeed, I think it is likely—that the arguments Putnam gives in the body of his 1988 book undermine the sort of symbol-system functionalism that equates propositional attitudes with functional states. That would not affect my point here.)',\n"," '# The Alleged Representation/Process Complementarity\\n\\nIn the realm of symbol-system functionalism, there exists a strong representation/process complementarity. This concept suggests that it is meaningless to discuss something as a \"representation\" (i.e., a symbol) without specifying the processes that act upon it. This idea has a long-standing presence in cognitive science and psychology, supported by researchers who have distinct, albeit related, views on representation compared to the symbol-systems approach. Notably, Palmer (1978) and Gallistel (1989) have explored representation through the lens of measurement theory (Krantz, Luce, Suppes, & Tversky, 1971; Suppes & Zinnes, 1963). In this framework, two domains are defined: the representing and the represented. A function maps objects from the represented domain onto those in the representing domain, determining which objects \"stand for\" others.\\n\\nWhile the \"stands for\" relation is a part of representation conceptions inspired by measurement theory, it is not the primary focus. As Palmer (1978, pp. 266-267) explains, measurement theory emphasizes the relationships among objects in the two domains. The \"information\" or \"representational content\" in the representing domain is found in the set of relations among its objects. Once a mapping is established, the significant \"representing\" occurs through these relationships. Common examples involve representing a continuously varying magnitude in the represented domain by a magnitude in the representing domain. For instance, Palmer illustrates how the height of rectangles in the represented domain is represented by the length of line segments in the representing domain. Various functions can be defined between the two magnitudes, such as using greater length to represent greater width, positing an inverse relation, or adopting an arbitrary mapping. Without a \"key\" to determine the relevant dimension of the representing objects, calling them representations is nonsensical. In cognitive psychology, Palmer views the key as the psychological processes that utilize the representations, with these \"processing operations\" interpreting length as information about width. Within this framework, as Palmer (1978) argues, \"one cannot discuss representation without considering process\" (p. 265).\\n\\nBoth the measurement-theory and symbol-systems approaches propose a strong representation/process complementarity. This complementarity arises from similar features: entities are treated as representations because they are defined relative to rules for manipulating them (in the symbol-systems case) or operations for extracting information (in Palmer\\'s case). When considering these approaches as guides for theorizing about representation in natural psychological systems, their implications are nearly equivalent: no representation exists without processes acting upon token representations.\\n\\nDespite the plausibility of the representation/process complementarity in the reviewed conceptions, I argue that this complementarity does not apply to all viable notions of representation in psychology. Specifically, I assert that defining representations solely by the processes that operate over them is a mistake. Psychology requires principled constraints for individuating representational states in organisms, but these constraints need not reference the processes acting upon representations. I maintain that the functional analysis of organisms into systems with biological or psychological functions to represent environmental states—such as the visual system—provides sufficient constraint on the notion of representation for guiding empirical research. Relying exclusively on the representation/process approach could hinder research.\\n\\nI do not reject representation/process complementarity outright. Independently of the conceptions of representation discussed, complementarity arises concerning the epistemology of ascribing representational states to an organism. An investigator cannot infer the existence of internal representations without positing a set of processes involving those representations. This is the familiar point that, currently, the primary data for ascribing psychological states to organisms is behavioral. To infer the presence of an internal representation based on behavior—such as a field mouse\\'s avoidance behavior indicating predator representation—one must also posit other internal representations and processes mediating between input and output. The mere presence of a predator and the mouse\\'s \"appropriate\" behavior does not establish that the mouse represented and responded to the predator. One must determine how often the mouse behaves this way, whether it responds similarly to all approaching objects or primarily to predators, and how sensory stimulation might have been processed to represent a predator\\'s presence. Any ascription of internal representations based on behavioral evidence entails assumptions about internal processes.\\n\\nHowever, it should not be concluded that being a representation is determined by the processes that utilize it. One should distinguish between the evaluation of evidence for positing representations, which requires imputing internal processes, and the claim that these processes satisfy a necessary condition for internal states being representations. This distinction separates an epistemological condition on investigating internal representations from an ontological claim that internal states are representations solely due to their role in mediating between input and output. I accept the epistemological point but deny the ontological one.\\n\\nThis distinction between the epistemology and ontology of representation may initially seem futile: surely, designating an internal state as a representation depends on its role in mediating inputs and outputs. This point is central to symbol-functionalist thinking. Nonetheless, I deny it. My denial is based on the idea that some systems in organisms (including humans) serve the function of representing the environment, regardless of whether the information represented enters further processing. It is crucial to be precise here. I am not claiming that systems representing environmental states never affect behavior; rather, I assert that for a given token representational state to be a representation, it is unnecessary for that state or a type-identical one to enter a process affecting behavior or other internal representations.\\n\\nIn my view, something can be a representation simply by being a state of a system whose function is to represent. According to this perspective, some internal states of organisms are \"natural representations,\" meaning they are states with the natural biological or psychological function of representing the environment. In any instance, they may serve this function without affecting behavior. Their status as representations depends on being a state of a system whose function is to generate representations. Thus, a visual percept represents the environment because it is a state of a visual system, not because it controls behavior. Of course, a system might not be considered a visual system if it serves no function in controlling behavior. For present purposes, I am willing to concede that the ability to influence behavior is a condition for counting something as a visual system. To be considered a visual system, it might be necessary for a system to guide an organism\\'s response to its environment by extracting spatial information from ambient light. As I will argue in contrasting my position with Dretske\\'s, this concession does not negate my point.',\n"," '# Bio-Psychological Function and Representation\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing trend toward interpreting psychological functions by drawing analogies with biological functions and using this notion of function to ground ascriptions of content. K. V. Wilkes (1978, chap. 4) provided an early explicit interpretation of \"functionalism\" in psychology in terms of biological function. The early functionalist arguments of Putnam (1967) and Fodor (1968, chap. 3) implicitly relied on the biological and artifactual notion of function (see Hatfield, 1988a), while overtly emphasizing the mathematical notion of a functional relation between the input and output of real or ideal machines. More recently, Millikan (1984) and Dretske (1988) have developed accounts of content that draw upon the notion of biological function, as have I (Kosslyn & Hatfield, 1984; Hatfield, 1988b). Although these recent uses of the notion of function in grounding ascriptions of content share some similarities, they have been developed from different starting points and yield different implications. In particular, the Millikan-Dretske approach emphasizes the notion of biological function as applied to input-output analyses of behaving organisms; it effectively combines the notion of biological function with orthodox functionalism to explain how content may be ascribed to internal states that mediate between input and output. In contrast, I have applied the notion of biological function to the analysis of specific psychological systems, such as the visual system; the notion of content is invoked as part of the analysis of the system in question, not in an attempt to provide a theory of content for beliefs and desires in general, as in the orthodox functionalist program.\\n\\nDretske\\'s 1988 book attempts to provide a naturalistic account of meaning that could serve in explanations of behavior. Dretske distinguishes between two levels of meaning. He calls the first level \"natural meaning\" (referring to Grice, 1957) or \"indication,\" which he equates with his earlier (Dretske, 1981) notion of \"information\" (1988, pp. 58-59). Many natural states are indicators of other natural states: tracks in the snow indicate the previous presence of the bird that made them, the width between tree rings indicates the amount of yearly rainfall, and a state in an animal\\'s nervous system may indicate the presence of food. For there to be \"indication\" in each case, it is necessary that there be a dependence between the indicator and the indicated, such that the indicator would not be present unless the indicated had been present. Dretske contrasts this \"indicator\" sense of meaning with the sort of meaning possessed by psychological representations such as beliefs. Beliefs differ from natural meaning in possessing one characteristic mark of intentionality: the ability to misrepresent. In defining indicators strictly in terms of dependence, Dretske rules out misindication: if the purported indicator could have been present without the indicated property or thing having been present, there is no indication. By contrast, beliefs are the sort of thing that can misrepresent, as the existence of false beliefs makes apparent. Dretske attempts to develop a theory of meaning appropriate to belief by building upon the indicator relation.\\n\\nDretske\\'s account of representation places great weight on the role of internal states in the production of behavior. In his primary analysis of representational content, indicators become representations (here, beliefs or belief-like states) by virtue of their role in causing behavior. In schematic terms, Dretske\\'s account of a situation in which internal state F of organism O represents external state G is as follows: the fact that F causes M in O is explained by the fact that F indicates G in O\\'s environment and G is needed or desired by O (where M is an instance of O\\'s behavior). In other words, an internal state F comes to represent G when it causes appropriate behavior toward G and causes that behavior because it indicates G. It is not the causal chain leading from F to M that is itself of interest; Dretske is instead targeting the cause of O being so wired that F causes M. He is asking for the cause of it being the case that O includes a causal chain leading from F to M, and not for a mechanical explanation of how F causes M. In his terms, he is looking for a \"structuring cause\" of the relation between G and M, and not the \"triggering cause\" of a particular instance of M (Dretske, 1988, pp. 42-50, 83-87).\\n\\nWhen the above conditions are met, Dretske says that it is the \"intrinsic function\" of F to represent G. (Dretske explicates intrinsic function by analogy with biological function; see Dretske, 1988, pp. 63-64.) Thus, a certain internal state F has the function of representing food when, in addition to indicating the presence of food, it also causes an organism, say, to approach and eat the food. In this case, misrepresentation can occur because although states of type F typically indicate food, they nonetheless can occur in the absence of food. When they so occur, they are not indicators but, on Dretske\\'s view, they are representations. They are representations that misrepresent the state of affairs. Token instances of state F can misrepresent the presence of food despite it being their function to represent food because something can have a given function even if it does not always successfully perform it: The function of the lens in the human eye is to promote clear vision, even if it fails to do so in some people or during part of the lifetime of a particular person. In the case at hand, it is precisely because it is the intrinsic function of F to represent G that an aberrant occurrence of F is assigned the content G.\\n\\nMy own view of representation places great weight on the functional analysis of an organism into systems and subsystems. The designation of an internal state of the organism as a \"representation\" occurs in the context of ascribing to various systems the function of producing or modifying representations. The basic idea is that some states of an organism are representations by virtue of being part of a system whose function is to generate states internal to an organism that \"stand for\" some external state or event. Thus, sensory systems might be ascribed the function of representing distal states, and other systems (such as pictorial memory) the function of storing and allowing access to the information contained in the representations produced by sensory systems. In schematic terms similar to those used by Dretske, the view may be stated as follows: F represents G in O because it is the function of the system of which F is a state to represent states of G\\'s type, and of states of type F to represent states of type G in particular. The notion of \"function\" used here is the same as that used by Dretske: biological or psychological function. The difference between the two approaches comes down to my insisting that some internal systems, such as the visual system, simply have the function of representing external states of affairs. From this, I draw the conclusion that states of such systems can be representations without it being the case that they enter into further processing.\\n\\nThe content of my own view may be brought into sharper focus by showing how it leads to this last conclusion in a way that neither the symbolist view nor Dretske\\'s does. One can plausibly argue that even on the symbolist view, token symbols can count as symbols even though they do not enter into further processing: Imagine a token symbol inscribed directly into a visual memory buffer that never gets cleared and, it so happens, is never again accessed. One would still say that it was a symbolic representation relative to the system of which it was a part, on the grounds that it could enter into subsequent processing. (Ultimately, such judgments would rest on the fact that the symbol has the \"right\" relation—a relation that might be, in an actual computer, mediated by compilers—to the CPU.) Similarly, one might argue that in Dretske\\'s view, although states of type F must on occasion produce behavior M and do so because they represent G, token states might be instantiated without actually causing behavior M: a given token of F might fail to produce M because O had a conflicting desire for external object H represented by internal state J, which caused behavior N. In both cases, there is a sense in which an internal state can be a representation without entering into further processing: if it is a token of a type that could enter into further processing.\\n\\nHerein lies the crucial difference from my position. In the symbolist and Dretskean views, what makes a state a representation is its relation to a CPU in the one case and its standard behavioral upshot in the other. In my view, whether a token of a given type of representation could enter into further processing is irrelevant to whether the token counts as a representation; what makes a state a representation is the fact that it is a state of a system whose function is to generate representations.\\n\\nSuppose for a moment that the visual system in higher primates has the function of representing (i) the distal spatial layout, (ii) changes in that layout, and (iii) the motion of the organism through the layout (Gibson, 1966, p. 156). Among its representational functions is that of representing the precise spatial configuration of distal surfaces, a function it performs well up to some limit of acuity. Its possible representational states range across the spatial configurations that it can represent: these form a series of possible representational states, F1 to Fn, which is at least indefinitely large (if, owing to limitations on acuity, not infinite). It is my contention that each of the states Fi are legitimately denominated representational states of the system even if some subset of them (a) never enters into further processing, and (b) would have no effect on behavior if it did.\\n\\nOutcome (a) is, in fact, empirically plausible: as a result of the well-known bottleneck effect (Sperling, 1960), a large portion of any given visual spatial representation is not subject to further processing. It would not diminish their status as representations if spatial representations of a particular class of tetrahedra always happened to be part of what did not get through. Further, it also seems plausible to suppose that there are some surface layouts which, if seen, would have no effect on behavior (outcome b), for example, because they happened always to occur in proximity to surfaces that were especially behaviorally salient. Thus, if tetrahedra were rarely present in the visual field and then only in the fields of hungry primates and only in proximity to food, they might be represented but never have an effect on behavior (assuming their rarity keeps them from becoming \"signs\" of food). In each case, the status of such spatial representations as representations depends upon the fact that they are bona fide representational states in a system whose function is to produce spatial representations. According to this view, although the visual system may have evolved because having a system that generated representations of the spatial layout aided the guidance of behavior in an adaptive manner, the spatial content of any given perceptual representation is not determined by its past or present behavioral upshot.\\n\\nThis view of perceptual representation must be fleshed out to avoid certain kinds of objections. In particular, it must avoid the objection that, in fact, only those spatial representations that guide behavior have true \"content\" or \"meaning\" and that other such representations are mistakenly assigned content by analogy with those that do or could guide behavior. Such representations might be seen, from Dretske\\'s perspective, as superfluous states produced by a mechanism that has as its function the production of states that do or could guide behavior. From the standpoint of selectional theories in biology, they might be seen as accidental consequences of a process that was selected because it generated behavior-guiding representations. They would be by-products of the true behavior-guiding function of vision, just as heart sounds are a by-product of the blood-pumping function of the heart. The response to such objections requires a more fully articulated functional analysis of the visual system. Marr\\'s (1982) work provides such an analysis.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Functional Analysis and Marr\\'s Three Levels}\\n\\nA key aspect of Marr\\'s approach is the concept of task analysis, which involves understanding the purpose of a given system or process. Marr incorporated this idea into a comprehensive framework for analyzing information processing systems at three distinct levels: computation, algorithm, and implementation.\\n\\nWhile the term \"computation\" often suggests the step-by-step manipulation of numerical or logical arguments, Marr\\'s first level of analysis is more accurately described as a functional or task analysis. At this level, the goal is to define the purpose of a system and outline the basic strategy it uses to fulfill its function (Marr, 1982, pp. 22-23, 25). For instance, a computational analysis of the auditory perceptual system might identify the types of information the system extracts, the energy forms it responds to, and the \"strategy\" it employs to interpret variations in energy. The second level of analysis involves specifying the representational system that encodes input and the algorithms that transform these representations to perform the system\\'s function. In the auditory system, this might involve transducing basic representations of pitch, amplitude, phase, and inter-ear time differences, and then applying specific algorithms to determine the location and characteristics of a sound source. The third level, implementation, focuses on the physical realization of the representations and algorithms identified in the second level. For natural information-handling systems, this description involves neural networks; for artificial devices, it might describe a real-time processor and associated memory buffers. The distinctions between these levels are not rigid, and the boundary between the first two levels may vary depending on the granularity of the analysis: what is considered an algorithm (level two) in a broad description might be seen as a task specification (level one) in a more detailed analysis.\\n\\nMarr\\'s task analysis of the visual system distinguishes the relatively \"pure\" perceptual processes of early vision from later processes like object recognition. According to his analysis, the function of early vision is to represent the spatial configuration of surfaces in the immediate environment, including their orientation and distance from the viewer (Marr, 1982, pp. 41-42, 268-289). Early vision is concerned with representing the spatial layout, generating accurate spatial representations that can be used for various purposes: guiding local movement, navigating by distant landmarks, detecting desired objects, and anticipating danger (pp. 34-36). These spatial representations can be accessed by numerous subsequent processes, and it is likely that organisms would not have visual systems if they did not produce representations that could be accessed in this way. However, in Marr\\'s analysis, the primary function of early vision is simply to produce representations of distal surfaces.\\n\\nThis analysis of early vision\\'s function informs much of Marr\\'s (1982, chaps. 2-9) work on vision. He develops models of how the visual system computes accurate representations of objects\\' spatial features from the light patterns received by the retinas. Although he describes representations as elements in a symbol system (pp. 20-21), the spatial representations generated by his models are clearly intended to \"stand for\" distal surfaces (p. 44). In explaining how these representations are constructed, he attributes a set of \"assumptions\" to the visual system, which he characterizes as background knowledge about the external world\\'s structure. Two such assumptions are that the visible world consists of cohesive objects with smooth surfaces and that individual points on these surfaces have a unique position in space at any given time (pp. 112-113). He demonstrates how a system operating under these assumptions could compute stereoscopic depth from binocular disparity (pp. 113-116) and provides similar analyses for computing object motion, shape, and surface texture. In each case, his analysis is guided by the notion that early vision\\'s function is to produce representations of the spatial structure of the distal layout.\\n\\nThe existence of Marr\\'s theory does not, by itself, resolve the objections raised in the previous section. Determining the function or functions of the visual system is a complex problem, and Marr\\'s analysis could be incorrect: early vision might have a more limited function than producing representations of distal surfaces. Its extensive generation of spatial representations might be an incidental by-product of its role in guiding motion to avoid danger and secure resources like food and shelter. However, it seems more plausible that producing such representations is part of a strategy to obtain an accurate representation of the distal layout, which can be accessed by various subsequent processes. From this perspective, the visual system\\'s function is not to produce representations for any specific purpose but to create an accurate representation of the distal layout.',\n"," '\\\\section*{TASK ANALYSIS AND THE CONNECTIONIST-SYMBOLIST DEBATE}\\n\\nThe concept of representation in the \"stands for\" sense, as discussed in previous sections, is not exclusively tied to Marr\\'s task analysis approach. However, as demonstrated in the context of early vision, this approach naturally incorporates this notion of representation. I propose that connectionist models are well-suited to both the task analysis approach and the \"stands for\" sense of representation. Furthermore, I argue that considering Marr\\'s three levels of analysis highlights the fundamental differences between connectionist and symbolist approaches.\\n\\nThe ongoing debate between symbolists and connectionists centers on whether connectionist models can address aspects of human cognition such as systematicity and compositionality—features that symbol system models are inherently designed to handle. Proponents of symbolism have attempted to corner connectionists by arguing that either connectionist models cannot manage compositionality, or if they can, then connectionism is not distinct from symbolism but merely a method of implementing traditional models (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). This argument is often framed in terms of rules and representations: it is claimed that only the symbol-systems approach can model cognitive features involving rule-governed manipulation of representations, which are essential for higher cognitive functions like perception, concept learning, problem-solving, and language learning.\\n\\nThese arguments misunderstand the fundamental differences between connectionist and symbolist models and overlook legitimate differences of opinion on empirical matters. First, regarding the principled differences, connectionism and symbolism differ in their conceptions of the computational machinery underlying cognition. The primary difference lies in the basic operations each approach posits. Symbol-systems approaches incorporate the ability to manipulate token representations—symbols—into the cognitive system as a primitive. Cognitive processes in such systems can be \"rule-following\" in a literal sense, with rules explicitly formulated in the internal symbol system. In contrast, the connectionist approach does not embed syntactic or cognitive-like abilities into its basic operations; instead, it begins with simple capacities from which it constructs cognitive abilities, including symbol manipulation. Connectionist systems compute when a pattern of activation passes among interconnected nodes: some nodes receive input, and the states of some nodes serve as output; in some systems, other nodes form hidden layers between input and output. Basic operations in connectionist systems include producing an output when inputs to a node reach a threshold and adjusting the threshold based on past activity (Feldman & Ballard, 1982; Rumelhart, 1989). Both symbolist and connectionist systems allow for programming computations, but in different ways. Symbolist programs are conceived as rules expressed in an internal language, while connectionist models build a network that computes tasks through its connectivity, without necessarily involving symbol manipulation unless the task itself is symbolic.\\n\\nThe fundamental differences between symbolism and connectionism relate to the built-in primitive operations in each system. Connectionist models are symbol-free in that symbols are not among the system\\'s primitive features; however, they can provide algorithms and implementations for tasks that are symbolic under a Marr level one description. Assuming these models are adequate for the task (a matter still under investigation, as with symbolist models), they offer an explanatory advantage over symbolist models by treating syntactic operations as requiring explanation rather than as a primitive ability. From a symbolist perspective, connectionism makes the operation of the CPU an explicit object of investigation. More broadly, connectionist models invoke symbols only for tasks with a symbolic task analysis, such as natural language perception. In contrast, the symbofunctionalist approach views all cognitive processes—whether perceptual, conceptual, or linguistic—as mediated by a language of thought, while connectionist models do not necessarily see all cognition as inherently symbolic. Task analysis provides the framework for determining the representations and processes to be posited in modeling a particular cognitive capacity.\\n\\nA second systematic difference between some connectionists and their symbolist counterparts pertains to task analysis itself: some connectionists believe that even seemingly symbolic tasks are not truly governed by hard rules but should be viewed as probabilistic processes. They argue that hard rule descriptions, such as those provided by linguists for a speaker\\'s grammatical abilities, are idealizations; psychology should explain linguistic performance, not idealized competence (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986a). These connectionists contend that hard-rules task analysis should be limited to idealized descriptions and that actual cognitive capacities should be conceived probabilistically. Smolensky (1988) suggests that connectionist models of concepts are more realistic than traditional symbolist models because they capture the context sensitivity and \"family resemblance\" character of concepts. According to this view, the supposed advantage of classical systems in handling hard-rule behaviors is an illusion based on a mistaken task analysis; indeed, one might conjecture that hard-rule task analyses were projected onto many cognitive tasks by those already enamored with the symbolic paradigm. By offering probabilistic task analyses, connectionists are not claiming that their models can handle probabilistic relations and symbolic models cannot. Instead, they argue that the advantage claimed for symbolist models—that they are particularly well-suited for modeling cognition because it is rule-governed and symbolist models have an inherent affinity for modeling rule-governed cognitive processes—may not be an advantage. Determining which group is correct is a long-term empirical matter.\\n\\nSome connectionists accept the \"hard rules\" task analysis and develop connectionist models that instantiate rule-governed abilities. Shastri (1988) has attempted to model hard-rule knowledge and inference abilities connectionistically (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1989). Dell (1985) combines the hard-rule approach to linguistic ability with a connectionist model that claims to provide a better account of performance errors. Such models align with the spirit of task analysis in traditional rule and representation approaches but assert that connectionist models offer a more powerful or empirically plausible implementation.\\n\\nCollectively, these connectionist positions challenge the assumption made by Fodor and others that symbolic task analyses necessitate physical symbol-systems realizations (Fodor, 1987, pp. 135, 138-139). They question both the claim that all cognitive operations should be analyzed as hard-rule governed tasks and the claim that only symbolist models can effectively model such tasks.',\n"," '# Connectionist Representations\\n\\nIn the symbolist paradigm, the concept of representation is inherently linked to syntax, whether one subscribes to solipsism, as in Fodor (1980), or to a form of semantic realism, as in Fodor (1987). In this view, representations are symbols defined in relation to a symbol processor. In contrast, connectionist models do not define a system\\'s state as a representation solely based on its well-defined status within the computational architecture. Instead, the designation of certain states as representations depends on their functional role within the model, which is determined by the task the model is designed to perform. While it could be argued that the plausibility of representation assignments in symbolist models also relies on task analysis, in symbolist models, the decision that representational elements must be symbols at the computational architecture level is made before any task analysis is conducted.\\n\\nIn connectionist models, the assignment of representational status to elements is contingent upon task analysis, meaning that the conception of representation may vary depending on the task being analyzed. For instance, in connectionist models of long-term memory or stored knowledge, \"representational content\" is determined by the relationship a given state has with other states in memory and with input and output systems. A particular concept in a connectionist model might derive its content from its connectivity pattern with other concepts. For example, the concept of \"Quaker\" might be defined by its relationship to other parts of a semantic network, including the concepts of \"person\" and \"pacifist\" (Shastri, 1990). Alternatively, it might gain its content through its role in recognizing Quakers as Quakers. In models of perceptual abilities, representational status is conferred by assigning certain network states the function of directly representing the state of the environment (Ballard, Hinton, & Sejnowski, 1983). In a model of surface perception, network states are ascribed representational status because their function is to represent the distal layout (Lehky & Sejnowski, 1988). In each case, task analysis dictates the assignment of representational status.\\n\\nThere are multiple conceptions of how connectionist nodes realize representational content. Those focused on learning or knowledge structures emphasize the representational function of connectivity patterns. In Shastri\\'s (1988) model of knowledge storage, the connectivity pattern (including wiring paths, excitatory or inhibitory gain, and firing thresholds) is used to store information in a propositional format (subject-predicate form) that can be queried in various ways. The pairing of subjects and predicates depends entirely on the connectivity pattern; once established, dynamic activation serves only to retrieve (actively represent) the knowledge. When a model of knowledge storage is presented without a coordinated model of object recognition, the assignment of representational content depends on the relationships among representational states, similar to many symbolist models (see Newell, Rosenbloom, & Laird, 1989, and Newell & Simon, 1976).\\n\\nIn models of active cognitive processes such as inference or perception, dynamic properties of nodes, such as firing frequency or activation patterns, become prominent. In an extension of his knowledge storage model, Shastri allows firing frequency to represent the relationship between specific objects and a predicate structure (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1990). The predicate structure is divided into three components: giver, givee, and object given, each assigned to a node or collection of nodes. Additional nodes correspond to potential individual arguments, such as John, Mary, and Ivanhoe. The statement \"John gave Mary Ivanhoe\" is instantiated by John resonating with the giver, Mary with the givee, and Ivanhoe with the object given. This arrangement allows extensive background knowledge stored in connection weights to influence specific active propositions; inferences from one proposition to another, sensitive to background knowledge, are mediated by the spreading activation of resonance patterns. In this case, connectivity serves the representational function of storing knowledge, while the activity pattern represents \"active\" knowledge and mediates inference processes.\\n\\nIn perceptual models, the activity pattern itself typically serves the representational function. In one model (Kienker, Sejnowski, Hinton, & Schumacher, 1986; Sejnowski & Hinton, 1989), figure/ground is represented by the spatial position and excitatory value of nodes, following the topology of connectivity. Input consists of activating the node array with a given value, computation proceeds through a simulated annealing paradigm, and output is the net\\'s equilibrium state, with two areas of similarly activated adjacent nodes, one serving as the figure and the other as the ground, separated by a border of edge-unit nodes. The net\\'s representational content is the spatial information contained in the activation pattern: such models do not address recognition abilities but focus on figure/ground segregation of a spatial array. The \"rules\" for computing figure/ground segregation are embedded in the connectivity pattern.\\n\\nIn models for perceptual abilities like figure/ground segregation, the connection weights that instantiate the rules for segregation need not be considered representations in the sense of stored knowledge, any more than neurons in the retina are ascribed knowledge or representation of the rules for computing lateral inhibition. In each case, the connection weights simply instantiate the rules the system follows. One might choose to call these rule-instantiating systems: systems that compute a particular algorithm to perform a given task, but to which it would make little sense to ascribe \"knowledge\" in the form of representations realized in the connection weights (see Hatfield, in press). Regardless of how processing rules are conceived, the activation pattern in such models is a representation that stands for a spatial structure in the world. However, it possesses no formal characteristics that make it a representation \"in itself\": it is a representation of a spatial structure because it is a state of a system whose function is to produce such representations.',\n"," '**Function-Based Accounts of Content: Challenges and Considerations**\\n\\nIf my proposal regarding the subject matter of cognitive psychology is accepted, it addresses a significant objection to using function-ascriptions as a foundation for assigning representational content. Fodor (1988) has argued that function-ascriptions are insufficient to support the assignment of full propositional content. Specifically, he contends that function-based accounts of content cannot resolve the \"disjunction problem,\" contrary to the claims of Dretske and others. The disjunction problem relates to the issue of error: as Dretske (1988, pp. 64-70) notes, to capture intentionality, ascriptions of representational content must rely on more than a mere causal or indicator relationship between representation and what is represented. Such relationships would make a representation \"about\" whatever causes it. Humans can make errors: we might represent a fly as present when there is only a moving black dot, even if both flies and black dots typically trigger our fly-representation. Fodor argues that evolution could not provide a basis for ascribing the same intentional disjunction to frogs, as selection does not concern itself with whether frogs perceive flies as moving black dots or flies, as long as their mechanism effectively catches enough bugs. An evolution-based functional description of the mechanism would not differentiate between representing flies and representing black dots, thus failing to support fine-grained content ascriptions.\\n\\nCurrently, it is uncertain whether biologically based functional descriptions can provide a basis for analyzing intentionality with such precision; the matter is still debated. However, these descriptions can support weaker content ascriptions: they can serve as a basis for attributing to the frog\\'s visual system the content of \"target fly/moving dot,\" or some similarly coarse-grained content. Furthermore, they can account for error, as the system is in error when its function is to represent targets, yet it activates when no target is present. Fodor might argue that the frog\\'s eye is essentially a fly-or-moving-black-dot-or-nothing detector, and that selection only cares that the detector activates the tongue to catch flies often enough. This argument would effectively dismiss function-ascriptions that distinguish between a system\\'s normal function and misfunction; thus, the function of a system is whatever it literally does.\\n\\nI tend to believe that function-ascription, with its minimal degree of intensionality, is too deeply embedded in the practices of biology and psychology to be easily dismissed. Among the functions of the frog\\'s visual system is representing something as present when it is, and not representing something as present when it is not. Until a strong case is made that such ascriptions are fundamentally misguided, they remain valid subjects for philosophical analysis. Fodor\\'s intuitions about \"what selection can do\" become problematic if they challenge such ascriptions. Functional analysis may or may not be capable of addressing full-scale intentionality, but it seems a promising approach to understanding more modest representational achievements.\\n\\nIn this context, there appears to be no objection to using functional analysis in content ascriptions. In doing so, a task analysis (either explicit or implicit) guides the imputation of representations. Whether such representations must be conceived as symbolic depends on the task being analyzed: language perception seems to require symbolic representations at its primary level, while spatial perception does not. Connectionist models allow some representational tasks to be explained without resorting to an internal symbol system; they also offer the possibility of explaining syntactic abilities that symbolic models merely assume. Connectionist models align well with the task-analysis approach. This combination seems less implausible than the symbolic paradigm as a framework for developing theories of cognitive capacities.',\n"," '**2. Eliminativism and Folk Psychology**\\n\\nEliminativism, as we will use the term, refers to the notion that certain categories of entities, processes, or properties, which are utilized in common sense or scientific explanations of the world, do not actually exist. In this sense, we are all eliminativists about various things. In the realm of folk theory, witches serve as a classic example. There was a time when witches were widely believed to be responsible for various local misfortunes. However, over time, people realized that there were more plausible explanations for the events attributed to witches. With no explanatory role left for witches, rational individuals concluded that witches do not exist. In the scientific domain, phlogiston, caloric fluid, and the luminiferous ether are prime examples of eliminativism. Each was once invoked by serious scientists engaged in sophisticated research programs. However, these programs eventually encountered significant issues, and the theories that included these entities were replaced by new theories in which these entities had no role. The scientific community gradually recognized that phlogiston and similar concepts do not exist.\\n\\nAs these examples illustrate, a key step in an eliminativist argument is typically demonstrating that the theory invoking certain supposed entities or processes should be rejected and replaced by a superior theory. This raises the question of how we determine that one theory is better than another. This question is notoriously easier to pose than to answer. However, it is generally agreed that if a new theory offers more accurate predictions and better explanations than an old one, covers a broader range of phenomena, and aligns as well or better with well-established theories in related fields, then there is a strong reason to consider the old theory inferior and the new one preferable. While this is not a comprehensive account of the conditions under which one theory is preferred over another, it will suffice for our purposes.\\n\\nHowever, merely demonstrating that a theory in which a class of entities plays a role is inferior to a successor theory is not enough to prove that the entities do not exist. Often, a more appropriate conclusion is that the rejected theory was incorrect, perhaps significantly so, about some properties of the entities in its domain or the laws governing those entities, and that the new theory provides a more accurate account of those same entities. For instance, pre-Copernican astronomy was very wrong about the nature of the planets and the laws governing their movement. Yet, it would be absurd to suggest that Copernicus and Galileo proved that the planets Ptolemy described do not exist. In other cases, the correct conclusion is that the elements of the old theory are reducible to those of the new one. Standard examples include the reduction of temperature to mean molecular kinetic energy, the reduction of sound to wave motion in a medium, and the reduction of genes to sequences of polynucleotide bases. Given our current concerns, the lesson from these cases is that even if the common sense theory involving propositional attitudes is replaced by a better theory, that alone would not demonstrate that the elements of the common sense theory do not exist.\\n\\nWhat more would be needed? What distinguishes cases like phlogiston and caloric from cases like genes or planets? Or, to phrase it differently, what made phlogiston and caloric candidates for elimination? Why wasn\\'t it concluded that phlogiston is oxygen, that caloric is kinetic energy, and that earlier theories were simply mistaken about some properties of phlogiston and caloric?\\n\\nLet\\'s introduce some terminology. We will call theory changes in which the entities and processes of the old theory are retained or reduced to those of the new one \"ontologically conservative\" theory changes. Theory changes that are not ontologically conservative will be termed \"ontologically radical.\" With this terminology, the question we are asking is how to distinguish ontologically conservative theory changes from ontologically radical ones.\\n\\nAgain, this is a question that is easier to ask than to answer. In the philosophy of science literature, there is nothing close to a plausible and fully general account of when theory change supports an eliminativist conclusion and when it does not. In the absence of a principled way to decide when ontological elimination is appropriate, the best we can do is examine the elements of the old theory—those at risk of elimination—and ask whether there is anything in the new theory they might be identified with or reduced to. If the elements of the new theory seem deeply and fundamentally different from those of the old theory, in the way that molecular motion seems deeply and fundamentally different from the \"exquisitely elastic\" fluid posited by caloric theory, then it is plausible to conclude that the theory change has been radical, warranting an eliminativist conclusion. However, since there is no easy measure of how \"deeply and fundamentally different\" a pair of elements are, the conclusion we reach is bound to be a judgment call. To argue that certain types of connectionist models support eliminativism about propositional attitudes, we must make it plausible that these models are not ontologically conservative. Our strategy will be to contrast these connectionist models, like those outlined in Section 5, with ontologically conservative models, such as the one sketched at the end of Section 3, to highlight just how ontologically radical the connectionist models are. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Before attempting to persuade you that connectionist models are ontologically radical, we need to examine the folk psychological theory that these connectionist models aim to replace.',\n"," '**3. Propositional Attitudes and Common Sense Psychology**\\n\\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we will assume that common sense psychology can be reasonably considered a theory, with beliefs, desires, and other propositional attitudes serving as its theoretical constructs. Although this assumption is not without controversy, it has been convincingly argued by others. Once we accept that common sense psychology is indeed a theory, it is likely that most will agree it is a candidate for eventual replacement. This is not to disparage folk psychology or to question the status of the entities it posits. Our point is simply that folk wisdom on psychological matters is unlikely to encompass all there is to know.\\n\\nDifferences in theory can justify the suspicion of an ontologically radical change. At one extreme, writers like Lycan advocate a very liberal view, suggesting that we can abandon large portions of our commonsensical theories of belief or desire without concluding that we are no longer discussing belief or desire. Lycan posits that the ordinary term \"belief\" points toward a natural kind not yet fully understood, which mature psychology will eventually reveal. He expects that \"belief\" will refer to some kind of information-bearing inner state of a sentient being, though it may possess only a few of the properties commonly attributed to beliefs by common sense (Lycan, 1988, pp. 31-32).\\n\\nWe find both extreme positions implausible. As noted earlier, the Copernican revolution did not disprove the existence of the planets studied by Ptolemy, but Lavoisier\\'s chemical revolution did disprove the existence of phlogiston. Yet, under Lycan\\'s \"very liberal view,\" it is difficult to see why we should not conclude that phlogiston exists after all—it\\'s really oxygen, and prior to Lavoisier, \"we were just very wrong about a lot of things.\"\\n\\nFor an early and influential statement of the view that common sense psychology is a theory, see Sellars (1956). More recently, this view has been defended by Churchland (1970, 1979) and Fodor (1988). For the opposing view, see Wilkes (1978), Madell (1986), and Sharpe (1987).\\n\\nCommon sense psychology, like other folk theories, is bound to be incomplete and likely inaccurate in several respects. If this were not the case, there would be no need for a careful, quantitative, experimental science of psychology. With few exceptions, most people agree that there are many psychological facts and principles beyond those embedded in common sense. If this is correct, then we have the first premise needed in an eliminativist argument aimed at beliefs, propositional memories, and other propositional attitudes. The theory that posits these attitudes is indeed a prime candidate for replacement.\\n\\nThough common sense psychology contains a wealth of lore about beliefs, memories, desires, hopes, fears, and other propositional attitudes, the crucial folk psychological tenets linking connectionism and eliminativism are the claims that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in producing other propositional attitudes and ultimately behavior. Following Stich (1983), we\\'ll call this cluster of claims propositional modularity. (Note: This notion of propositional modularity should not be confused with the different notion of modularity defended by Fodor (1983).)\\n\\nThere is substantial evidence supporting the thesis that folk psychology is committed to the tenets of propositional modularity. The fact that common sense psychology attributes semantic properties to beliefs and other propositional attitudes deserves special emphasis. According to common sense:\\n1. When people see a dog nearby, they typically come to believe that there is a dog nearby.\\n2. When people believe that the train will be late if there is snow in the mountains and come to believe that there is snow in the mountains, they typically come to believe that the train will be late.\\n3. When English speakers say, \"There is a cat in the yard,\" they typically believe that there is a cat in the yard.\\n\\nThese generalizations of common sense psychology are expressed in terms of the semantic properties of the attitudes. It is by virtue of being the belief that \\\\( p \\\\) that a given belief has a specific effect or cause. Thus, common sense psychology treats predicates expressing these semantic properties, such as \\'believes that the train is late,\\' as projectable predicates—those appropriately used in nomological or law-like generalizations.\\n\\nThe most obvious way to highlight folk psychology\\'s commitment to the thesis that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete states is to note that it makes sense to claim that a person has acquired or lost a single memory or belief. For example, it might be claimed that when Henry awoke from his nap, he had completely forgotten that the car keys were hidden in the refrigerator, though he had forgotten nothing else. In saying that folk psychology views beliefs as things that can be acquired or lost one at a time, we do not deny that having a particular belief may presuppose a network of related beliefs. The belief that the car keys are in the refrigerator is not one that could be acquired by someone unfamiliar with cars, keys, or refrigerators. But once the relevant background is in place, as it is for us and Henry, folk psychology is comfortable with the possibility that a person may acquire or lose the belief that the car keys are in the refrigerator while the rest of their beliefs remain unchanged. Propositional modularity does not deny that acquiring one belief often leads to acquiring related beliefs. When Henry is told that the keys are in the refrigerator, he may come to believe that they haven\\'t been left in the ignition or his jacket pocket. But he may not. Indeed, on the folk psychological conception of belief, it is possible for a person to have a long-standing belief that the keys are in the refrigerator and continue searching for them in the bedroom.\\n\\nTo illustrate how folk psychology views propositional attitudes as functionally discrete, causally active states, let\\'s consider two examples:\\n1. In common sense psychology, behavior is often explained by an agent\\'s beliefs and desires. To explain why Alice went to her office, we might note that she wanted to send some e-mail messages and believed she could do so from her office. However, an agent may have several sets of beliefs and desires that could lead to the same behavior. Alice might also have wanted to talk to her research assistant and believed he would be at the office. In such cases, common sense psychology assumes that Alice\\'s going to her office might have been caused by either belief/desire pair or both, and determining which option is correct is an empirical matter. It is possible that Alice\\'s desire to send e-mail played no role in her behavior; it was the desire to talk with her research assistant that caused her to go to the office. However, had she not wanted to talk with her research assistant, she might have gone to the office anyway because the desire to send e-mail, which was causally inert in her actual decision-making, might have become actively involved. In this case, common sense psychology recognizes distinct semantically characterized states, one of which may be causally active while the other is not.\\n2. Our second example focuses on beliefs and inference rather than desires and action. On the common sense view, a person may have several belief clusters, any of which might lead them to infer a further belief. When they draw the inference, folk psychology assumes it is an empirical question what they inferred it from, and this question typically has a determinate answer. Suppose Inspector Clouseau believes the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel and arrived back on the morning train. Suppose Clouseau also believes the village hotel is closed for the season and the morning train is out of service. Given these beliefs and some widely shared background beliefs, Clouseau might infer that the butler is lying. If he does, folk psychology presumes the inference might be based on his beliefs about the hotel, the train, or both. It is possible, from the perspective of common sense psychology, that although Clouseau has long known the hotel is closed for the season, this belief played no role in his inference on this occasion. Again, we see common sense psychology invoking distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active while the other is inert.\\n\\nIn psychological literature, there is no shortage of models for human belief or memory that align with common sense psychology in assuming propositional modularity is true. Before the emergence of connectionism, nearly all psychological models of propositional memory, except those proposed by behaviorists, were compatible with propositional modularity. These models typically view a subject\\'s beliefs or memories as an interconnected collection of functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that interact systematically. Some models represent individual beliefs as sentence-like structures—strings of symbols that can be activated by transferring them from long-term memory to a central processing unit. Other models represent beliefs as a network of labeled nodes and links through which activation patterns may spread. Still, others represent beliefs as sets of production rules. In all these models, for any given cognitive episode, like performing an inference or answering a question, some memory states will be active, and others will be dormant.\\n\\nIn Figure 9.1, we display a fragment of a \"semantic network\" representation of memory, in the style of Collins & Quillian (1972). In this model, each distinct proposition in memory is represented by an oval node with labeled links to various concepts. By adding assumptions about how questions or memory probes lead to activation spreading through the network, the model enables predictions about speed and accuracy in experimental memory studies. Three facts about this model are particularly important. First, since each proposition is encoded discretely, it is straightforward to add or subtract a single proposition from memory while leaving the rest of the network unchanged. For example, Figure 9.2 depicts the result of removing one proposition from the network in Figure 9.1. Second, the model treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of beliefs or memories as projectable. They are treated as predicates that pick out scientifically genuine kinds, suitable for inclusion in lawlike regularities. This is evident in how such models are tested against empirical data about memory acquisition and forgetting. Typically, it is assumed that if a subject is told that the policeman arrested the hippie, they will likely remember it. This assumption expresses a nomological generalization—it captures something lawlike about the cognitive system. So while people who remember that the policeman arrested the hippie may differ psychologically, the theory treats them as a psychologically natural kind. Third, in any given memory search or inference task using a semantic network model, it makes sense to ask which propositions were activated and which were not. Thus, a search in the network of Figure 1 might terminate without ever activating the proposition that cats have paws.',\n"," '\\\\section*{4. A FAMILY OF CONNECTIONIST HYPOTHESES}\\n\\nIn the previous section, we discussed how common sense psychology is committed to propositional modularity and how many cognitive psychology memory models align with this assumption. In this section, we aim to describe a class of connectionist models that, we argue, do not readily align with propositional modularity. These connectionist models share three key properties:\\n\\ni. Information is encoded in the connection weights and biases of units in a distributed manner, rather than being localized.\\n\\nii. Individual hidden units in the network lack a clear symbolic interpretation; they are subsymbolic, a term suggested by Paul Smolensky.\\n\\niii. These models are intended as cognitive models, not merely as implementations of cognitive models.\\n\\nLater in this section, we will elaborate on each of these features, and in the next section, we will present a simple example of a connectionist model that meets our criteria. We acknowledge that our discussion may not provide a precise characterization of the connectionist models we have in mind, but such precision is not essential for our argument. Our goal is to convince you that a significant class of connectionist models is incompatible with the propositional modularity of folk psychology.\\n\\nBefore delving into the three features, it is helpful to provide a general characterization of the models we refer to as \"connectionist\" and introduce some associated terminology. To this end, we quote from Paul Smolensky\\'s insightful overview:\\n\\nConnectionist models are large networks of simple, parallel computing elements, each carrying a numerical activation value computed from neighboring elements using a simple numerical formula. These network elements or units influence each other\\'s values through connections with numerical strengths or weights.\\n\\nIn a typical model, input is provided by imposing activation values on the network\\'s input units, representing an encoding of the input. The activation propagates along the connections until a set of activation values emerges on the output units, encoding the system\\'s computed output. Between the input and output units, there may be hidden units that do not directly represent the input or output.\\n\\nThe computation performed by the network in transforming the input pattern to the output pattern depends on the connection strengths, which are usually regarded as encoding the system\\'s knowledge. In this sense, the connection strengths function like a program in a conventional computer. A key appeal of the connectionist approach is that many networks can autonomously tune their weights to perform specific computations, often through training with sample input/output pairs. In networks with hidden units, the network itself determines the computations performed by these units, as they are not explicitly instructed on their values, even during training.\\n\\nOne additional point to Smolensky\\'s description is that in many connectionist models, hidden and output units are assigned a numerical \"bias\" added to the calculation determining the unit\\'s activation level. Learning procedures typically adjust both the connection strengths and biases, so the system\\'s knowledge is encoded in both.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s explain the three features that characterize the connectionist models we consider incompatible with propositional modularity:\\n\\n(i) In many non-connectionist cognitive models, it is straightforward to locate a functionally distinct part of the model encoding each proposition or state of affairs. According to Fodor and Pylyshyn, \"conventional [computational] architecture requires distinct symbolic expressions for each state of affairs it can represent.\" In some connectionist models, similar functional localization is possible, not only for input and output units but also for hidden units. For example, certain connectionist models have individual units or small clusters representing specific environmental properties or features. A strong positive connection between such units might represent the proposition that if one feature is present, so is the other. However, in many connectionist networks, propositional representation cannot be localized beyond the input layer, making it difficult to semantically evaluate specific features or states. This can be inconvenient when the system fails to achieve its goal due to inadequate world representation. As Smolensky notes, \"It is not necessarily possible to localize a failure of veridical representation. Any particular state is part of a large causal system of states, and failures to meet goal conditions cannot generally be localized in any particular state or component.\"\\n\\nWe refer to connectionist networks where it is impossible to isolate the representation of particular propositions or states within nodes, connection strengths, and biases as having information encoded in a distributed rather than localist manner.\\n\\n(ii) As mentioned, some connectionist models have units representing specific environmental properties or features, serving as symbols for these properties. However, in models where weights and biases are tuned by learning algorithms, it is often not the case that any single unit or small collection of units represents a specific feature straightforwardly. Such networks are often viewed as collectively or holistically encoding a set of propositions, though none of the hidden units, weights, or biases are comfortably viewed as symbols. We refer to this representation strategy as subsymbolic. Networks using subsymbolic strategies typically encode information in a distributed manner.\\n\\n(iii) The third point concerns how connectionist models are interpreted. We must presuppose a notion of theoretical or explanatory level, which, despite much discussion, remains unclear. The clearest way to introduce this notion is against the background of the functionalist thesis that psychological theories are analogous to programs implementable on various computers. If one accepts this analogy, it makes sense to ask whether a connectionist model is intended as a psychological model or at the level of neural implementation. Due to their similarity to real neural architectures, connectionist models are often viewed as models of psychological process implementation. Some model builders endorse this view explicitly. However, viewed this way, connectionist models are not psychological or cognitive models, just as a story of cognitive processes implemented at the quantum mechanical level is not a psychological story. A different view is that connectionist models are at the psychological level, competing with other psychological models of the same phenomena. For example, a connectionist model of word recognition would be an alternative to a non-connectionist model, and a connectionist theory of memory would compete with a semantic network theory. Connectionists holding this view often draw analogies with other sciences. Smolensky, for example, suggests that connectionist models relate to traditional cognitive models (like semantic networks) as quantum mechanics relates to classical mechanics. In each case, the newer theory is deeper, more general, and more accurate over a broader range of phenomena, competing at the same explanatory level. If one is right, the other must be wrong.\\n\\nIn light of our concerns, the analogy between connectionist models and quantum mechanics may beg an important question. While quantum mechanics is considered a better theory than classical mechanics, the shift from classical to quantum mechanics was arguably an ontologically conservative change. It is unclear if the change was ontologically radical. If our central thesis is correct, the relation between connectionist models and traditional cognitive models is more like the relation between the caloric theory of heat and the kinetic theory. The caloric and kinetic theories are at the same explanatory level, though the shift was clearly ontologically radical. To support the argument that the caloric analogy is more appropriate, we will describe a simple connectionist model of memory that meets the three criteria we have been discussing.',\n"," '\\\\section*{5. A Connectionist Model of Memory}\\n\\nOur objective in developing this model was to create a connectionist network capable of performing some of the tasks traditionally handled by cognitive models of memory, while clearly demonstrating the distributed, sub-symbolic encoding discussed earlier. We initiated this by constructing a network, referred to as Network A, designed to evaluate the truth or falsehood of the sixteen propositions listed in Figure 9.3. This network is a standard three-layer feed-forward network comprising 16 input units, four hidden units, and one output unit, as illustrated in Figure 9.4. The input encoding for each proposition is displayed in the center column of Figure 9.3. Outputs near 1 were interpreted as \\'true,\\' while those near zero were considered \\'false.\\' We employed backpropagation, a well-known connectionist learning algorithm, to train the network, adjusting the connection weights and biases accordingly. Training concluded when the network consistently produced outputs above 0.9 for true propositions and below 0.1 for false ones. Figure 9.5 presents the connection weights between the input units and the leftmost hidden unit in the trained network, along with the bias on that unit. Figure 9.6 shows the connection weights and biases further upstream. Figure 9.7 illustrates how the network computes its response to the proposition \"Dogs have fur\" when encoded in the input units.\\n\\nIn a clear sense, the trained Network A can be said to store information about the truth or falsity of propositions (1)-(16), as it accurately assesses the truth value of any presented proposition. In this regard, it resembles various semantic network models designed to perform similar tasks. However, a notable difference exists between Network A and a semantic network model like the one depicted in Figure 9.1. In semantic networks, each proposition is associated with a functionally distinct sub-part, allowing us to determine whether a specific proposition\\'s representation played a causal role. In contrast, the connectionist network lacks a distinct state or part representing any particular proposition. Information in Network A is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network. When extracting information from Network A by providing an input string and observing the output unit\\'s value, numerous connection strengths, biases, and hidden units contribute to the computation. Any specific weight, unit, or bias encodes information about multiple propositions. Thus, it is nonsensical to ask whether a particular proposition\\'s representation plays a causal role in the network\\'s computation. This aspect of our connectionist model of memory starkly contrasts with the propositional modularity of common-sense psychology. As discussed in Section 3, common-sense psychology assumes that there is generally an answer to whether a particular belief or memory played a causal role in a specific cognitive episode. However, if belief and memory are supported by a connectionist network like ours, such questions lack clear meaning.\\n\\nThe incompatibility between propositional modularity and connectionist models like ours becomes even more apparent when comparing Network A with a second network, Network B, depicted in Figures 9.8 and 9.9. Network B was trained similarly to Network A, with the addition of one more proposition to the training set (coded as indicated below the line in Figure 3). Thus, Network B encodes all the propositions of Network A plus one more. In semantic network models and other traditional cognitive models, it is straightforward to identify which states or features encode the added proposition and determine whether its representation played a role in a specific episode modeled by the system. However, in the connectionist network, such questions are meaningless. The point is not that there are no differences between the two networks; on the contrary, the differences are numerous and widespread. However, these differences do not systematically correlate with the functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states posited by folk psychology and traditional cognitive models. Since information is encoded in a highly distributed manner, with each connection weight and bias embodying information relevant to many propositions, and information regarding any given proposition scattered throughout the network, the system lacks functionally distinct, identifiable sub-structures that can be semantically interpreted as representations of individual propositions.\\n\\nThe contrast between Network A and Network B allows us to illustrate the incompatibility between common-sense psychology and these types of connectionist models differently. As noted in Section 3, common-sense psychology treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of propositional attitudes as projectable. Thus, predicates like \\'believes that dogs have fur\\' or \\'remembers that dogs have fur\\' are projectable in common-sense psychology. Both Network A and Network B could serve as models for a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur; both networks store or represent this information. Moreover, these are not the only two possibilities. Training a network on the 17 propositions in Figure 9.3, with a few additions or subtractions, would yield another system as distinct from Networks A and B as they are from each other. The takeaway is that, although there are countless connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur as effectively as Network A, these networks lack projectable features describable in the language of connectionist theory. From the perspective of the connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind but rather a chaotically disjunctive set. While common-sense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a psychologically natural kind, connectionist psychology does not.',\n"," '\\\\section*{6. OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES}\\n\\nThe argument presented in the previous sections has faced numerous objections. In this section, we will reconstruct the most compelling of these objections and provide our responses.\\n\\n**Objection (i): Models like A and B are not serious models for human belief or propositional memory.**\\n\\nThe models we have constructed are simplified examples designed to clearly illustrate the features discussed in Section 4. They were never intended to represent a comprehensive model of human propositional memory. Critics have raised concerns that these models cannot scale effectively; while it may be feasible to train a network to recognize a small number of propositions, scaling up to thousands or hundreds of thousands of propositions seems implausible. Additionally, traditional memory models, such as those using sentence-like storage, semantic networks, or production systems, offer strategies for inference and generalization, allowing systems to answer questions about propositions they were not explicitly taught. Our models, however, are criticized for lacking these capabilities. Furthermore, it is argued that these models fail to account for the human ability to easily acquire propositional information one proposition at a time, without the need for extensive retraining.\\n\\n**Reply:** If this paper aimed to defend connectionist models of propositional memory, we would need to address each of these criticisms in detail. However, there are points to be made in favor of connectionist models. For instance, it is not true that networks like A and B cannot generalize beyond their training data. In Network A, for example, the training set included:\\n\\n- Dogs have fur\\n- Cats have fur\\n- Dogs have paws\\n- Cats have paws\\n- Dogs have fleas\\n- Cats have fleas\\n\\nIt also included \"Dogs have legs\" but not \"Cats have legs.\" When the network was presented with the latter proposition, it correctly generalized and responded affirmatively. Similarly, it responded negatively to \"Cats have scales,\" despite not having encountered this proposition before. However, addressing these criticisms point by point is unnecessary for our thesis. We are defending a conditional thesis: if connectionist models of memory, as described in Section 4, are correct, then propositional attitude psychology is in serious trouble. Since conditionals with false antecedents are true, we prevail by default if the antecedent is false.\\n\\n**Objection (ii): Our models do not truly violate the principle of propositional modularity, as the propositions learned are coded in functionally discrete ways, though this may not be obvious.**\\n\\nThis objection has been elaborated in three different ways. The first version, Objection (iia), suggests that functionally discrete coding may be difficult to detect and not visible upon casual inspection. For example, sentences stored in a typical von Neumann architecture computer may be scattered across memory addresses but are still stored in a functionally discrete manner. Similarly, connectionist networks may encode propositions in functionally discrete ways, even if this is not immediately apparent.\\n\\n**Reply (iia):** This objection is challenging because it suggests that there might be an undiscovered functionally discrete system of propositional encoding in our models. We concede that such a system might exist, and if discovered, it would undermine our argument. However, the burden of proof lies with the critic to demonstrate that such a system is not only possible but likely. Without substantial evidence, the mere possibility is not a significant threat.\\n\\nThe second version, Objection (iib), proposes that the encoding is found in the activation patterns of hidden nodes when a proposition is presented. Each activation pattern can be represented as a point in a four-dimensional hyperspace, which may be viewed as the encoding of the proposition.\\n\\n**Reply (iib):** Identifying the activation pattern with the belief in a proposition is implausible. Beliefs and propositional memories are typically enduring states, whereas activation patterns are transient and only exist when the network processes the relevant input. A network cannot maintain multiple activation patterns over time, making it unreasonable to equate them with beliefs or their representations.\\n\\n**Objection (iic):** Some critics suggest that long-standing beliefs might be identified with dispositions to produce activation patterns, rather than the patterns themselves. This distinction could capture the difference between dispositional and occurrent beliefs in connectionist models.\\n\\n**Reply (iic):** While dispositions to produce activation patterns are enduring states, they do not align with the discrete, causally active states required by folk psychology. In common sense psychology, beliefs can interact causally in some cognitive episodes and remain inert in others. In a distributed connectionist system, the dispositional state producing one activation pattern is inseparable from others, making it impossible to isolate propositions as causally active or inactive. Therefore, reaction pattern dispositions are inadequate as belief tokens. If models like A and B offer the best accounts of human belief and memory, we may face an ontologically radical theory change, suggesting that propositional attitudes, like caloric and phlogiston, do not exist.',\n"," '# Order Out of Chaos\\n\\nIn \"Zettel,\" Wittgenstein (1981) writes:\\n\\n> 608. No supposition seems to me more natural than that there is no process in the brain correlated with associating or with thinking; so that it would be impossible to read off thought-processes from brain-processes. I mean this: if I talk or write there is, I assume, a system of impulses going out from my brain and correlated with my spoken or written thoughts. But why should the system continue further in the direction of the center? Why should this order not proceed, so to speak, out of chaos?  \\n> 609. It is thus perfectly possible that certain psychological phenomena cannot be investigated physiologically, because physiologically nothing corresponds to them. (p. 106)\\n\\nThis suggests to some philosophers that they should not prejudge the nature of the causes of behavior.\\n\\nBehavioral patterns exhibit enough \"system\" to support radical interpretation (Davidson, 1984) and allow for the adoption of the intentional stance (Dennett, 1978, 1987). Through this interpretive strategy, we apply a psychological framework to the complex behaviors of an intentional system, such as a human being. This psychological framework is structured by the public language sentences used with psychological verbs: \"she believes that...\", \"she desires that...\", \"she intends that...\". While these behaviors likely have causal explanations, we should not assume that the causes—whether physiological or otherwise—must mirror the structure of the psychological description. This is a contemporary interpretation of the lesson some philosophers derive from \"Zettel,\" pages 608-609.\\n\\nIt is not surprising, then, that philosophers with a Wittgensteinian perspective might be drawn to connectionism. A connectionist network, which performs cognitive tasks through connections to and from a mass of individually uninterpretable hidden units, seems to embody the idea of order emerging from chaos. In contrast, the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis appears, from this viewpoint, as an unnecessary assumption that the \"system\" must extend \"further in the direction of the center.\"\\n\\nHowever, this initial reservation about the LOT hypothesis is open to debate. It is possible to argue that it is highly improbable for richly structured behavior to occur without causal antecedents that exhibit the structure of a LOT. The constraint for such arguments is that they must consider, rather than dismiss, the possibility of alternative causal antecedent patterns suggested by connectionism.\\n\\nA second, potentially more serious, reservation is that the LOT hypothesis involves a regress of some kind.\\n\\nA sentence is, among other things, a syntactic object. When a sentence of a public language is presented to someone who understands the language, they can assign a meaning to it, thus treating it as a semantic object. So, if thinking involves tokens of sentences in the LOT, for whom are these sentences objects? To whom are these inner sentences presented as syntactic items needing interpretation?\\n\\nAnswering that the LOT sentences are presented this way to the individual thinker seems unsatisfactory, as it implies a regress of languages: a metalanguage of thought to think about the sentences in one\\'s language of thought, a metametalanguage, and so on. Alternatively, suggesting that a thinker\\'s LOT sentences are presented as syntactic items to a \"little man\" who reads and understands them on an inner blackboard also seems hopelessly regressive. Since understanding involves thinking, the \"little man\" would need his own inner blackboard and a further, smaller \"little man\" to read it.\\n\\nOnce this concern arises, it may seem that the thesis that thinking requires an inner language of thought is as philosophically questionable as the thesis that picking a red flower requires an inner collection of color cards (Wittgenstein, 1969, p. 3).',\n"," '## Avoiding the Threat of Regress\\n\\nConcerns about the potential regressiveness of the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis should not deter us. The LOT hypothesis is not inherently regressive.\\n\\nTo understand this, we must first clarify what a minimal version of the hypothesis entails. Simply stating that thoughts possess syntactic properties is vague. We need to differentiate between two interpretations of \"thought\" and specify which properties are considered syntactic.\\n\\nThe term \"thought\" can refer to either thought contents or thought states. If we focus on thought contents, the LOT hypothesis can be easily trivialized. One might argue that thought contents are defined in a public language, like English, and thus inherit syntactic structure from their linguistic representation. However, the LOT hypothesis is not about the structure of public language descriptions of thinkers. It addresses the structure of the mental states attributed to individuals, not our linguistic attributions of these states.\\n\\nIf our primary concern were thought attributions in a public language, syntactic properties would be straightforward. But what does it mean to assert that certain states of a thinker possess syntactic properties?\\n\\nFrom Fodor\\'s work (1987a, pp. 16-21), we can derive three conditions for syntactic properties. First, a syntactic property is a higher-order physical property. Second, syntax is systematically related to semantics. Third, a syntactic property determines causal roles or powers.\\n\\nThese conditions may not be entirely clear. For instance, Fodor suggests that shape is an appropriate syntactic property, and shape is an intrinsic property. This raises questions about whether the first condition requires syntactic properties to be intrinsic rather than relational, whether this is a consequence of the third condition, or whether the definition of syntax excludes relational properties. (For a discussion on syntactic and formal properties, see Devitt, 1989). Additionally, we might question whether causal powers include both active and passive powers, and whether causal roles encompass both upstream and downstream roles.\\n\\nLet\\'s resolve this by focusing on active powers or downstream causal roles, and, setting aside other ambiguities, define a minimal syntactic property as a physical property systematically related to semantics and determining causal consequences.\\n\\nThe argument for the LOT presented here concerns specific states of thinkers. These states have semantic properties and serve as inputs to various processors or mechanisms. The conclusion is that these states possess properties correlated with their semantic properties, engaging those mechanisms. According to the minimal notion of syntax, these properties qualify as syntactic.\\n\\nThere is no potential regress in this conclusion. The states with syntactic properties are not presented to anyone—not to the thinker or an internal interpreter—as requiring interpretation. The processors engaged by these states are not like someone who, when presented with a syntactic item, must understand its meaning before acting.\\n\\nFodor (1987b) notes:\\n\\n\"[The formulas of LOT]—unlike those of German—can influence the course of thoughts without needing to be understood. This is because, according to the computational story, the psychological effects of Mentalese [LOT] formulas are mediated by their syntactic/intrinsic properties (rather than their semantic/relational properties). This is the trick computational psychologists use to benefit from postulating a language of thought without encountering the traditional problem of a regress of languages and interpreters.\" (p. 67)\\n\\nSome might argue that because the LOT hypothesis avoids regress, terms like syntax and language are misleading, as they suggest public language.\\n\\nBarwise (1987) hints at this complaint:\\n\\n\"I now realize that for Fodor, the features of language that make \\'language of thought\\' an appropriate metaphor relate to combinatorial-structural properties, whereas Perry and I reacted to the idea that these \\'expressions\\' must be \\'read\\' or \\'understood\\' like expressions in a language used for communication between agents.\" (p. 83)\\n\\nIf this complaint holds, the conclusion of the argument may not strictly validate the language of thought hypothesis. However, by clearly defining which properties are syntactic and agreeing that the minimal LOT hypothesis is not regressive, there is little to dispute. Terminological confusion can be avoided by distinguishing LOT from public languages.\\n\\nWith concerns about regress addressed, we can examine the argument\\'s structure. It unfolds in two main stages. The first stage argues for a conditional claim: If a cognitive process is systematic—in a defined sense—then its inputs have syntactic structure, as characterized minimally. The second stage argues that being a thinker—a believer, a concept deployer—involves systematic inferential transitions among thoughts. Consequently, the inputs to these transitions—thoughts—have syntactic structure, affirming the existence of a language of thought. (Two objections to the second stage are discussed later in this chapter.)',\n"," \"# The Drinks Machine\\n\\nConsider a simple example: a machine that dispenses coffee or tea, with or without milk. The machine's output states correspond to delivering one of four types of drinks. The input states are determined by the type of token inserted into the machine's slot.\\n\\nThere are four types of tokens: square red, square blue, round red, and round blue. If a square red token is inserted, the machine delivers coffee with milk. A square blue token results in coffee without milk. A round red token yields tea with milk, and a round blue token produces tea without milk.\\n\\nThis setup reveals a clear pattern in the machine's input-output relationship. Regardless of the token's color (red or blue), a square token results in coffee, while a round token results in tea. Similarly, regardless of the token's shape (square or round), a red token results in a drink with milk, while a blue token results in a drink without milk.\\n\\nWe can question whether the process linking input and output states is causally systematic according to the described pattern. For instance, is there a common explanation for delivering coffee when either a red square or a blue square token is inserted? Is there a shared mechanism responsible for these transitions? Similarly, is there a common explanation for adding milk when a red square or red round token is used?\\n\\nThe answers depend not on the input-output relationship but on the internal architecture of the drinks machine. One possible configuration could include four independent drink-producing devices, each activated by one of the four input states. Another configuration might involve three components: one device activated by either square token to produce coffee, another for round tokens to produce tea, and a third to add milk if a red token is used, or omit it if a blue token is used.\\n\\nThese configurations lead to different conclusions about causal systematicity. A machine with the first configuration is not causally systematic relative to the observed input-output patterns, while a machine with the second configuration is.\\n\\nThis example illustrates that viewing a physical system as comprising various subsystems or mechanisms requires that a mechanism explains all input-output transitions conforming to a pattern for causal systematicity. It is not enough for a common mechanism to be merely present; it must mediate between inputs and outputs according to the pattern.\\n\\nThe example also shows that conformity to an input-output pattern does not guarantee causal systematicity, as used in the argument for the Language of Thought (LOT). Two systems can have the same input-output relationship, yet one may be causally systematic relative to a pattern, while the other is not. This distinction is crucial in describing complex systems.\\n\\nThe conditional claim in this argument's first stage concerns systematic cognitive processes. These processes are systematic relative to patterns revealed under semantic descriptions of input and output states (or semantic descriptions of input states and action descriptions of output states). The semantic description of input states is vital because, according to our notion of syntax, there are no syntactic properties without semantic properties. (For other purposes, a different notion of syntax might be appropriate. See, for example, Stich, 1983; and for issues with syntax without semantics, Crane, 1990).\\n\\nFor a simple example where input states have semantic descriptions, we can revisit the drinks machine.\",\n"," '# The Sentence Interpreter\\n\\nLet\\'s explore the cognitive process involved in understanding English sentences. Specifically, we are examining the process that starts with recognizing that a particular sentence has been spoken and ends with understanding the message conveyed by that sentence.\\n\\nConsider the sentences: \"Martin is tired,\" \"Martin is tall,\" and \"Martin is drunk.\" In each case, understanding these sentences involves recognizing that the subject of the statement is Martin. We can identify a pattern in the input-output relationship: if the input state registers a sentence containing the name \"Martin,\" the output state indicates that the statement is about this person. Similarly, we can identify patterns related to the messages conveyed by other sentences, such as \"Martin is tired,\" \"Andy is tired,\" and \"Frank is tired.\" If the input state registers any of these sentences, the output state indicates that the message is about someone being tired.\\n\\nThe causal systematicity of this cognitive process requires more than just following these patterns. Systematicity, in relation to these generalizations, demands that for each pattern, there is a common mechanism that explains the input-output transitions captured by that pattern. Within the physical system responsible for sentence interpretation, there should be a component mechanism that mediates transitions between input states registering sentences with the name \"Martin\" and output states concerning this person. Similarly, there should be a mechanism that mediates transitions from input states concerning sentences with the predicate \"is tired.\" The interpretation of the sentence \"Martin is tired\" is thus the combined result of these two mechanisms. Causal systematicity, therefore, requires a genuine commonality of process.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Understanding Rules}\\n\\nThe concept of causal systematicity plays a crucial role in explaining the understanding of rules, as discussed in my previous works (Davies, 1987, 1989, 1990b, 1990c). When a system exhibits causal systematicity in relation to a pattern identified through a semantic description of its input and output states, it can be said to possess knowledge of the rule or generalization that describes that pattern.\\n\\nConsider the example of a sentence interpreter, which illustrates this concept clearly.\\n\\nUnderstanding the rule that sentences containing the name \"Martin\" refer to this specific individual does not necessitate the ability to explicitly articulate that this is a rule of the language. Instead, it requires causal systematicity concerning the input-output pattern defined by that rule.\\n\\nThe initial stage of the argument involves a conditional claim related to the understanding of rules: If a cognitive processing system embodies knowledge of a rule, then the system\\'s input states must have a syntactic structure. This claim does not imply that if a process is causally systematic and thus involves knowledge of a rule, it must operate through an explicit syntactic encoding of the known rule. According to this claim (and as Fodor suggests—see 1985, p. 95, 1987a, p. 25), the condition of understanding a rule can be fulfilled either by the presence of a component processor or by an explicit representation. The focus of the conditional claim is solely on the input states of cognitive systems.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{From System to Syntax}\\n\\nWe now have a basic understanding of both the antecedent and the consequent of the conditional claim. The concept of causal systematicity is relative, particularly in cases where systematicity is observed in patterns that emerge when input states are given semantic descriptions. The minimal notion of a syntactic property we are using is also relative, and in fact, doubly so.\\n\\nFirstly, what qualifies as a syntactic property depends on the presence of semantic properties, as a syntactic property must be systematically related to semantics. Secondly, what is considered a syntactic property of an input state depends on the actual constitution of the machine to which it is an input. A syntactic property must determine causal powers, and a property relevant to one machine's operation may be irrelevant to another's.\\n\\nUnderstanding a claim is one thing, but having an argument for its truth is another. We can make progress toward understanding why the conditional claim is true by revisiting the example of the drinks machine, where input states are described by the shape and color of tokens in the slot. We can observe that causal systematicity imposes requirements on the causal properties of input states.\\n\\nSuppose the operation of the drinks machine is causally systematic. Then, as part of the machine, there is a common mechanism that mediates the transition from either a square red token or a square blue token in the slot to the delivery of coffee. There must be a shared property among these input states that is causally adequate to engage that mechanism.\\n\\nThere must also be a causally relevant difference between these two input states, as one state engages the milk introducing mechanism while the other does not. To engage that mechanism, the input state of having a square red token in the slot must share a causal property with the input state of having a round red token in the slot—a property not shared by the other two input states. In short, the input states exhibit patterns of recurrent properties that determine the causal consequences of those states in the context of the drinks machine.\\n\\nIt is an empirical question as to what the causally salient properties of the input states are. Causal systematicity requires that the operative properties of the input states correlate with the properties cited in the descriptions of the input-output patterns. It might be that the squareness of tokens engages the coffee mechanism, and the redness engages the milk mechanism. Alternatively, the square or red tokens might share another common property, such as distinctive mass, chemical composition, or inscription.\\n\\nThe properties required by causal systematicity in the first example of the drinks machine do not yet qualify as syntactic properties, as no semantic properties have been introduced for correlation. We can take the final step toward understanding why the conditional claim is true by considering the second example involving the drinks machine, where the input-output pattern is revealed under a semantic description of the input states.\\n\\nSuppose the operation of the drinks machine is causally systematic relative to patterns revealed under semantic descriptions of the input states. This implies that the machine follows rules such as: Deliver coffee if the client wants coffee.\\n\\nThis causal systematicity requires that input states signifying the client's desire for coffee (with or without milk) share a causal property that engages the coffee-producing mechanism. Similarly, input states indicating the client's desire for a drink with milk should share a property that engages the milk introducing mechanism. There is no specific requirement for what these properties should be; they might or might not be the squareness and redness of the token in the slot. However, across the range of input states, they must correlate with the meaning that the client wants coffee or a drink with milk, respectively. Similar considerations apply to the example of the sentence interpreter.\\n\\nIn summary, causal systematicity relative to semantic input-output patterns (or knowledge of rules) requires that the machine's input states have properties correlated with their semantic properties, determining the causal consequences of those states given the machine's internal constitution. These properties will likely be physical, meeting all three conditions for syntactic properties.\\n\\nThere are two points to note about the conditional claim. First, the complexity of the syntax of input states may be minimal. For example, in the case of the drinks machine, the formal language of its input states has just four primitive symbols and one binary operation, which does not even distinguish the order of constituents. Second, not every aspect of semantic content needs to be articulated syntactically (cf. Perry, 1986). The argument for the conditional claim does not require a syntactic property corresponding to an aspect of semantic content constant across all input states (such as all input states meaning the client wants something). The drinks machine is dedicated to the client's wants, allowing for syntactic inarticulateness.\\n\\nThis concludes the first stage of the argument for the LOT hypothesis. Its plausibility depends on two factors: a minimal notion of syntactic property in the consequent of the conditional and a notion of causal systematicity in the antecedent that requires more than just a pattern in the input-output relation. The truth of the conditional claim is secured by a strong antecedent and a weak consequent. However, this strategy increases the burden on the second stage of the argument.\\n\\nThe second stage aims to uncover, within the common-sense framework of thought, concepts, and inference, a commitment to the causal systematicity of cognitive processes. This stage relies on a neo-Fregean conception of thoughts.\",\n"," '# The Structure of Thought\\n\\nThoughts are states with semantic content, which means they have truth conditions. However, thoughts are not the only states in the world that can be semantically evaluated, nor are they the only psychological states with semantic content. The feature of having content is shared by thoughts, certain patterns of sound waves, marks on paper, states of the visual system in humans and other animals, patterns of tree rings, and even room thermostats.\\n\\nThis does not imply that thoughts have content in the same way as these other states. While some might hope for a unified theory of all these contents, there are reasons to believe we need to differentiate between information content—where a causal-cum-teleological theory might apply—and mental content (the content of propositional attitudes), for which such a theory is inadequate.\\n\\nIf this is correct, then within a person\\'s psychological states, we must distinguish between states with mental content and those with mere informational content—between propositional attitude states and subdoxastic states (Stich, 1978). A significant endeavor in the philosophy of psychology is to provide a principled account of this distinction.\\n\\nOne approach to this project is to focus on the fact that thoughts—and attitude states in general—are states whose semantic content is conceptualized. A person in such a state inherently deploys the constituent concepts of that state\\'s content (cf. Davies, 1989). This is not the case for states of early visual processing, for example.\\n\\nThe term \"ipso facto\" is crucial; a person can certainly have a thought about the content of a state of visual processing and thus conceptualize that content. Similarly, a theoretical linguist might have a thought about the information content of a language system state. However, having these thoughts is not essential to being in the respective states.\\n\\nThe content of thoughts is conceptualized. To entertain a thought, hold a belief, or frame a hypothesis involves deploying concepts. Therefore, no one can entertain a thought with a particular content without understanding the constituent concepts of that content. Furthermore, for a thinker to have the concept of being F, the thinker must know what it means for an object to be F—that is, know what it means for an arbitrary object to be F. This epistemic requirement for possessing the concept of being F has an analogue for thoughts about particular objects; namely, the thinker should know which object is in question. Gareth Evans (1982, p. 65) refers to this as \"Russell\\'s Principle.\" As Evans points out (1982, pp. 76-79), these requirements involve rejecting the Photograph Model of mental representation.\\n\\nCombining these ideas leads to an important neo-Fregean consequence. To entertain the thought that object a is F, a thinker must have the concept of being F. If a thinker has that concept, then the thinker knows what it means for an arbitrary object to be F. So, if a thinker believes that a is F and can think about object b, then the thinker can entertain the thought—or frame the hypothesis—that b is F.\\n\\nThis consequence is what Evans (1982, p. 104) calls the \"Generality Constraint,\" which has an immediate consequence (perhaps not properly distinguishable from the Generality Constraint itself): a closure condition on the domain of thought contents available to a thinker.\\n\\nIf a thinker can be credited with the thought that object a is F and the thought that object b is G, then that thinker has the conceptual resources to also entertain the thought that a is G and the thought that b is F. Similarly, if a thinker can be credited with the thought that a is R to b, then that thinker has the conceptual resources to also entertain the thought that b is R to a. The domain of thought contents available to a thinker is closed under the recombination of conceptual constituents.\\n\\nThoughts are states with semantic content, and these contents are of a special kind that is subject to the Generality Constraint and thus to the closure condition. These are two important neo-Fregean claims. However, they do not directly lead to causally systematic processes, nor do they provide a direct argument for the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis.',\n"," '# Semantic Content and the Closure Condition\\n\\nLet\\'s first examine the claim that thoughts are states with semantic content. It\\'s important to note that the mere existence of semantic content does not inherently support the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis.\\n\\nImagine a creature that evolves in an environment where the primary predatory threat occurs when a hawk dives on a beetle. Suppose this creature develops a detector specifically for this scenario: a hawk-diving-on-beetle detector. This detector operates by being sensitive to the overall aspects of the threatening situation, rather than being composed of separate hawk and beetle detectors. It is highly plausible that, under a causal-cum-teleological notion of information content, there exists a state in this creature with the semantic content that a hawk is diving on a beetle. However, there is no reason to assume that this state possesses a syntactic constituent structure.\\n\\nNext, consider the claim that thought contents are subject to the closure condition. There is no compelling argument from the closure condition on semantic contents to the LOT hypothesis.\\n\\nOne aspect of the closure property is that if a system has a state with the content that \"a is R to b,\" it also has a state with the content that \"b is R to a.\" However, the existence of states with these contents does not necessitate a syntactically structured vehicle for semantic content.\\n\\nNow, suppose our creature with a hawk-diving-on-beetle detector also develops a second detector for another threatening scenario. Imagine that danger often arises when a beetle dives on a hawk, leading the creature to develop a beetle-diving-on-hawk detector. These two detectors, along with their downstream processors that trigger appropriate evasive behavior, are causally independent of each other. We could even consider each one as a module within the creature\\'s overall information processing system.\\n\\nThis example is designed to show that there is no common syntactic constituent in these two information-registering states. For instance, there is no syntactic symbol meaning \"hawk\" that is involved in both states. For the two states to share a syntactic constituent, there would need to be a common property systematically related to both the semantic content and the causal consequences of the states. While there is a common property related to their semantic contents—a complex relational property concerning the causal antecedents of the states—this property is not directly involved in producing the causal consequences of the states.\\n\\nThis example of the two detectors is, of course, a simplified model. The concept can be extended to more complex systems, such as the sensorimotor coordination system in Paul Churchland\\'s (1989) crab. Additionally, in the context of connectionist representation, the idea can be applied to the binding units used in simple tensor product schemes (Hinton, McClelland, and Rumelhart, 1986; Smolensky, 1987). However, with or without further examples, the principle is clear: compliance with the closure condition does not necessarily require syntax.\\n\\nOne might argue that all examples illustrating this principle are merely simplified models. It could be claimed that when attempting to meet the closure condition for a sufficiently rich set of semantic contents without exceeding available computational resources, syntactic articulation becomes necessary. The question arises: how else could it be done?\\n\\nThis is a significant challenge. While we are not obliged to deny that a well-developed argument could strongly support the LOT hypothesis, a \"How else?\" challenge always risks being met with a viable alternative. This is precisely what connectionists propose.\\n\\nThe LOT hypothesis is intended to highlight a potential tension between our self-conception as thinkers and the connectionist program. Therefore, the argument from our common-sense conception to the LOT must not appear to presuppose a conclusion against connectionism. What is needed, and what is being offered here, is a more direct and a priori argument than any \"How else?\" challenge.\\n\\nIf we do not rely solely on a \"How else?\" challenge, we should also avoid an argument by analogy that proceeds as follows:\\n\\nThe semantic contents of natural language sentences meet a closure condition. For example, if there is a sentence that means \"a is R to b,\" then there is also a sentence that means \"b is R to a.\" Natural language sentences meet this closure condition through a syntactic constituent structure. Thought contents meet a similar closure condition. Therefore, by analogy, thoughts must also have a syntactic constituent structure.\\n\\nThe analogy between the meanings of natural language sentences and the contents of thoughts is not perfect. After all, one can have mere phrasebook mastery of a language fragment, whereas it is not possible to have phrasebook mastery of thoughts (cf. Evans, 1982, p. 102). However, it is not necessary to dismiss the argument entirely. It simply cannot serve our dialectical purpose; at most, it can establish a plausibility consideration, pending the exploration of alternative vehicles for semantic content.',\n"," '\\\\section*{CONCEPTS AND INFERENCE}\\n\\nWe cannot directly conclude from the claims that thoughts possess semantic content and that these contents adhere to the closure condition. However, these claims do not fully encapsulate the significance of the neo-Fregean idea of conceptualized content.\\n\\nWhen considering the thought that $a$ is $F$, it involves mastering the concept of being $F$, which can be applied to further thoughts about other objects. Thus, it is not simply that if a thinker can conceive that $a$ is $F$ and $b$ is $G$, they can also conceive that $b$ is $F$. It is not just about having one state with the content that $a$ is $F$ and another with the content that $b$ is $F$. Rather, entertaining the thought that $a$ is $F$ and the thought that $b$ is $F$ involves deploying a shared piece of concept mastery—the mastery of the concept of being $F—and a shared piece of knowledge—understanding what it means for something to be $F$.\\n\\nThis is part of what is involved in the idea of conceptualized content, but it is not captured by the closure condition, as that condition could be met by states that are quite independent. The closure condition would be satisfied as long as, whenever there are states with the contents that $a$ is $F$ and $b$ is $G$, there are also states—even those that are intrinsically unrelated—with the contents that $a$ is $G$ and $b$ is $F$.\\n\\nBy considering the claim about shared concept mastery and combining it with the familiar notion of thoughts interconnected in an inferential web, we can derive a promising consequence for our argument. This consequence is explicitly stated in Evans (1981):\\n\\nTo hold a belief requires understanding its place within a network of beliefs. Thinking of beliefs in this way compels us to view them as structured states; the subject\\'s understanding of the inferential potential of one belief (e.g., the belief that $a$ is $F$) partly depends on the same general capacity as their understanding of the inferential potential of others (e.g., the belief that $b$ is $F$). Possession of this general capacity is often referred to as mastery of a concept. (p. 132)\\n\\nA thinker who holds the thought that $a$ is $F$ understands that it follows that $a$ is $H$, and similarly, from the thought that $b$ is $F$, it follows that $b$ is $H$. But this is not all. It is not merely an input-output pattern in the inferences the thinker is inclined to make. The two inferences are manifestations of a common underlying capacity: mastery of the concept of being $F$.\\n\\nAs Evans clarifies, the notion of a capacity or disposition should not be understood merely in terms of the truth of conditional statements, but in a \"full-blooded\" manner (Evans, 1981, p. 329). The idea of a common capacity manifested in the two inferences should be unpacked in terms of a common explanation, referring to a common state (Evans, 1982, p. 102). In short, there is causal systematicity relative to the input-output pattern in a thinker\\'s inferential practice.\\n\\nConsider a simple example. A thinker who holds the thought that Bruce is a bachelor understands that it follows Bruce is unmarried; similarly, from the thought that Nigel is a bachelor, it follows that Nigel is unmarried. The thinker appreciates the inferential potential of both thoughts, which depends on the same general capacity: mastery of the concept of being a bachelor.\\n\\nTo have either the thought that Bruce is a bachelor or that Nigel is a bachelor, the thinker must grasp the concept of being a bachelor. This involves knowing what it means for an object to be a bachelor, including that being a bachelor requires being unmarried. This single piece of knowledge—that for an arbitrary object to be a bachelor, it must be unmarried—is implicated in both inferential transitions the thinker is inclined to make.\\n\\nAll this is essential for the second stage of our argument. It is part of the neo-Fregean conception of a thinker that, in the realm of thought, there is genuine causal systematicity in inferential transitions.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Evans on the Language of Thought}\\n\\nOne might argue that our reliance on Evans is somewhat problematic. Evans (1982) himself states:\\n\\n\"It seems to me that there must be a sense in which thoughts are structured... This might seem to lead immediately to the idea of a language of thought... However, I certainly do not wish to be committed to the idea that having thoughts involves the subject\\'s using, manipulating, or apprehending symbols—which would be entities with non-semantic as well as semantic properties... I would prefer to explain the sense in which thoughts are structured, not in terms of their being composed of several distinct elements, but in terms of their being a complex of the exercise of several distinct conceptual abilities.\" (pp. 100-101)\\n\\nIn this passage, just before introducing the Generality Constraint, Evans explicitly rejects a certain interpretation of the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis, which suggests that it involves the subject\\'s use of symbols. He denies that the notion of structured thoughts directly leads to the LOT hypothesis.\\n\\nHowever, this does not undermine our argument. On these two points, we can fully agree with Evans. Firstly, the LOT hypothesis, as argued here, does not imply that the conscious, thinking subject perceives thoughts as entities with non-semantic properties. Such a notion would arguably be regressive. The LOT hypothesis pertains to the scientific psychological foundations of a subject\\'s conscious mental life.\\n\\nSecondly, our argument does not immediately leap to the LOT hypothesis from the idea of structured thoughts. Instead, it follows Evans by first considering the exercise of common capacities and interpreting these capacities in a comprehensive manner. The transition to the LOT involves a conditional claim linking the systematicity of processes with the syntactic structure in input states, established in the initial stage. This step in the argument is not explicitly anticipated by Evans, nor is it considered and rejected by him.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Concept Mastery and Primitively Compelling Inferences}\\n\\nA thinker might draw different conclusions about Bruce and Nigel, even if both are known to be bachelors. For instance, one might reasonably infer that Bruce drinks a lot of Foster\\'s Lager, while Nigel prefers Spanish champagne. Even when similar conclusions are drawn about both, there is no inherent guarantee that these inferences stem from a shared cognitive ability.\\n\\nThis raises questions about the plausibility of causally systematic inferential transitions, which might seem to be an artifact of the definability of the concept of a bachelor. Critics might argue that for most concepts, unlike \"bachelor,\" it is implausible to claim causal systematicity in inferential transitions.\\n\\nThis objection can be paired with the notion that when concept mastery does not involve knowing a definition, objects under the concept only share a family resemblance. This could further challenge the idea of a common cognitive capacity being used in inferences about different objects.\\n\\nHowever, we can counter this by suggesting that concept mastery may involve a commitment to a set of inferential principles, without these principles necessarily defining the concept. An alternative argument for causal systematicity in inferential transitions supports this view.\\n\\nChristopher Peacocke has developed a theory of concept mastery. In \"Thoughts\" (1986), he discusses canonical grounds and commitments for certain content classes. In \"What are Concepts?\" (1989a), he introduces the idea of a possession condition for a concept, often involving a thinker finding certain inferential patterns primitively compelling.\\n\\nPeacocke (1990) provides an example involving the concept of addition. Mastery of this concept includes finding the following inferential transition (T) primitively compelling: \\n\\\\[ 18 + 64 = n; \\\\text{ therefore, } 18 + (65) = n + 1. \\\\]\\nSimilarly, a master of addition finds this transition (\\\\(T\\'\\\\)) compelling:\\n\\\\[ 11 + 23 = m; \\\\text{ therefore, } 11 + (24) = m + 1. \\\\]\\nThere are many other such compelling inferential transitions.\\n\\nAccording to Peacocke, mastery of the concept of addition involves more than just finding these transitions compelling; it requires finding them compelling due to their form. This does not mean the thinker must conceptualize or articulate the form of inference (R):\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Given: } m + k = n; \\\\text{ Infer: } m + S(k) = S(n). \\\\]\\nInstead, the form of transition is causally explanatory, influencing why certain transitions are found compelling. This phenomenon of causally relevant forms or patterns is present in both humans and machines.\\n\\nIn this alternative development of our argument for the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis, Peacocke\\'s idea of form-driven compelling inferences is explained in terms of causal systematicity. A key requirement is that the commonality in compelling inferences—their form—should be mirrored by a commonality in the causal processes explaining them.\\n\\nGiven this explanation and the link between causal systematicity and rule knowledge, we might describe the common state in causal explanations of inferences like (T) and (\\\\(T\\'\\\\)) as a state of knowledge of rule (R). As Peacocke notes, this knowledge does not require the thinker to conceptualize or explicitly represent (R).\\n\\nIf the state of knowledge of an inferential rule like (R) mediates actual thought transitions—from the premise to the conclusion of (T) and (\\\\(T\\'\\\\))—we have an alternative version of our argument\\'s second stage. This version can encompass simple cases like the concept of a bachelor without limiting its application to definable concepts.\\n\\nCombined with the conditional claim from the first stage, it requires that the input states of the transition mediator for an inferential rule have a syntactic structure. Thus, it offers an alternative completion of our argument for the LOT hypothesis.',\n"," \"\\\\section*{Connectionism, Syntax, and Systematicity}\\n\\nOur common-sense understanding of ourselves often aligns with the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis. This alignment suggests a potential conflict with the connectionist approach to modeling cognitive processes.\\n\\nThe core of this argument is that typical connectionist networks lack causal systematicity and syntactic structure in their input states. While connectionism encompasses various models, some networks do exhibit these features, particularly those with local representations of all primitive concepts from a classical task analysis. However, our focus here is on connectionism with distributed representation, specifically networks employing microfeatural, dimension-shifted representation as described by Smolensky (1988).\\n\\nWe begin by examining whether connectionist networks possess syntactically structured input states. It's important to note that syntax is relative to semantics. Thus, the question becomes whether the input states of a network have syntactic structure in relation to the standard or classical semantic description of the network's function. Do the properties of connectionist input states align with the primitive concepts used in a classical analysis of the task the network is performing?\",\n"," '\\\\section*{Syntax}\\n\\nIn a connectionist network where representation is distributed rather than localized, activation at an individual input unit cannot be considered as the tokening of a syntactic element. This is because distributed representation implies that individual units do not serve as the vehicles of representation.\\n\\nFor instance, the input states of a network might represent facts about coffee in various contexts, such as in cups and jugs, with or without sugar. However, there is no single unit that represents the occurrence of coffee. The representation of coffee in a cup is not simply the activation of a coffee unit and a cup unit. Instead, it is a pattern of activation across multiple units that represents coffee in a cup.\\n\\nThis fact about distributed representation does not necessarily mean there is no syntactic description of connectionist input states. Activation at a single unit is merely a limiting case of a subpattern of activation. The units included in a total pattern of input activation certainly influence the causal consequences of that state. Therefore, given our minimal notion of syntactic property, a subpattern of activation over several units can be considered the tokening of a primitive symbol, provided that the subpattern corresponds to a semantic property of the input states in which it occurs.\\n\\nSo, while there is no specific coffee unit, could there be a particular distributed pattern of input activation that signifies coffee?\\n\\nIndeed, there are networks that exhibit subpatterns of input activation of this nature. In the networks studied by Ramsey, Stich, and Garon, the input states representing various propositions about dogs share a common subpattern of activation over eight input units, represented by the vector $\\\\langle 11000011\\\\rangle$. Similarly, the activation vector $\\\\langle 11001100\\\\rangle$ over those same eight units appears whenever the proposition concerns cats. When the proposition involves having fur, a common subpattern of activation over the remaining eight input units is represented by the vector $\\\\langle 00001111\\\\rangle$. Consequently, the pattern of activation for the proposition that dogs have fur can be seen as the tokening of two primitive symbols, with the co-occurrence of subpatterns being the network\\'s method of combining subject and predicate to form a sentence.\\n\\nHowever, Smolensky suggests that this is not the typical case. Regarding the constituent subpatterns of activation that represent coffee in various contexts—coffee with sugar, coffee in a cup, coffee in a jug—Smolensky (1988) states: \"These constituent subpatterns representing coffee in varying contexts are activity vectors that are not identical but possess a rich structure of commonalities and differences (a family resemblance, one might say)\" (p. 17). Even when focusing on representations of coffee in a cup, coffee in a jar, and coffee on a tree, different concepts are involved: coffee drink, coffee granules, and coffee beans. The point about contextual variation of microfeatural representation applies even when this response is no longer plausible. Therefore, there is no strictly common subpattern of activation that can be identified as a syntactic element meaning coffee.\\n\\nIf Smolensky is correct, then relative to a semantic description involving coffee, cups, jugs, and similar items, the input states of a typical connectionist network with distributed representation will not have a syntactic description.\\n\\nA similar point can be made regarding a network performing a sentence interpretation task. We can imagine that the input states registering which sentence has been uttered (or presented visually) utilize distributed microfeatural representation. Furthermore, the way predicates are pronounced (or written) may vary depending on the name with which they are combined. Consequently, the input representation of the predicate \"is drunk\" may vary between contexts such as \"Martin is drunk,\" \"Andy is drunk,\" and \"Frank is drunk.\" The constituent subpatterns may exhibit family resemblance rather than identity. In such cases, although the objects in the task domain have syntactic structure, the input states of the network will not, relative to their semantic description as representing the names, predicates, and sentences of the task domain.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Systematicity}\\n\\nThe observation that certain types of networks lack syntactically structured input states does not undermine the initial conditional claim supporting the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis. This claim remains valid as long as the networks in question do not demonstrate causal systematicity in their processes, particularly when considering input-output generalizations at the level of semantic description, as defined by classical task analysis. Indeed, these networks do not exhibit such systematicity.\\n\\nConsider a hypothetical network where input states represent various facts about coffee in different contexts. For instance, some input states might indicate coffee in a cup, coffee in a jug, coffee in a glass, coffee with sugar, and similarly for wine. Correspondingly, output states might represent a warm drink in a cup, jug, glass, or with sugar.\\n\\nSuppose this network performs basic inferential transitions. An input state signifying \"coffee in a cup\" results in an output state signifying \"warm drink in a cup\"; similarly, \"coffee with sugar\" leads to \"warm drink with sugar,\" and so forth. Observing this externally, a pattern emerges: whenever the input state signifies coffee, the output state signifies a warm drink.\\n\\nTo determine if the network\\'s process is causally systematic relative to this pattern, we must ask whether all coffee-to-warm-drink transitions share a common explanation. Specifically, is there a mechanism within the network responsible solely for these transitions?\\n\\nGenerally, the answer is no. There is not a single set of connection weights responsible for all and only the coffee-to-warm-drink transitions. In terms of rule knowledge, it is inaccurate to describe the network as possessing the rule: \"Given: there is coffee; Infer: there is a warm drink,\" even though the network\\'s behavior aligns with this rule.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the context of sentence interpretation, a network with distributed, microfeatural input and output encoding might conform to the rule: \"Given: the sentence contains the predicate \\'is drunk\\'; Infer: the proposition concerns the property of being drunk.\" However, if the input representation of \"is drunk\" varies, the explanation for the network\\'s conformity to this rule will differ from case to case.\\n\\nThis does not imply that connectionist networks involve entirely distinct and independent processes for each transition that follows a pattern. Connectionist networks offer a middle ground between strict commonality and complete autonomy or modularity. They exist between systems with rule knowledge and mere lookup tables.\\n\\nConnectionism does not challenge the conditional claim that causal systematicity of process implies syntactic structure in input states. With distributed representation, there is typically neither syntax nor systematicity. Moreover, there may be no systematicity in the input-output process, even when syntactic structure exists in the input states.\\n\\nThis typical lack of causal systematicity does not inherently oppose the connectionist approach. If a cognitive process is causally systematic, distributed connectionism may not be an ideal model. However, determining whether a cognitive process is systematic in the relevant sense is an empirical question.\\n\\nTherefore, whether modeling actual cognitive processes poses a challenge for connectionism requires detailed empirical investigation. Nonetheless, the second stage of our argument highlights a tension between the connectionist approach to modeling cognition and our common-sense understanding of ourselves as thinkers. At first glance, the connectionist paradigm does not offer a robust scientific psychological model for conceptualized thought and inference.',\n"," '# An Invitation to Eliminativism\\n\\nIf the preceding discussion holds true, it suggests a potential argument from connectionism to eliminativism—not the elimination of all semantic content, but rather the elimination of the bearers of semantic content within the common-sense framework: beliefs and thoughts in general.\\n\\nThe current argument highlights a tension between the common-sense framework and the connectionist approach, paralleling the discussion by Ramsey et al. in this volume. They propose a conditional claim: \"If connectionist hypotheses are correct, then eliminativism about propositional attitudes will also be correct.\"\\n\\nTheir argument unfolds in two main stages. First, they assert that the common-sense framework is committed to propositional modularity. This concept suggests that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in generating other attitudes and, ultimately, behavior.\\n\\nSecond, they argue that distributed connectionist networks do not exhibit propositional modularity.\\n\\nThe argument in this chapter similarly posits an incompatibility between a feature of the common-sense framework and connectionist hypotheses.\\n\\nRamsey et al. argue: Networks do not exhibit propositional modularity; the common-sense framework is committed to propositional modularity; therefore, connectionism opposes the common-sense framework. Similarly, this chapter argues: Networks do not exhibit syntax and causal systematicity of process; the common-sense framework is committed to syntax and causal systematicity of process; therefore, connectionism opposes the common-sense framework.\\n\\nThe parallel extends to specific details. Ramsey et al. argue that in a connectionist network, there are no functionally autonomous vehicles of proposition-sized semantic contents. When considering patterns of weights as potential vehicles, their point aligns with the claim that processing in networks is not causally systematic. This is unsurprising. If we consider the role of beliefs in mediating between desires and actions or inferentially between other beliefs, propositional modularity requires functionally autonomous transition mediators. This is also necessary for transitions—from desire to action or from belief to belief—to be causally systematic.\\n\\nEach argument aims to establish a necessary condition for a being to be a thinker (a believer, a deployer of concepts). In each case, this necessary condition pertains to internal cognitive architecture and is not guaranteed by behavioral facts. For any being whose behavior prima facie warrants attributing beliefs and other attitudes, according to the intentional stance, it remains an epistemic possibility that the being does not meet the condition on internal architecture.\\n\\nIn each argument, connectionism provides a vivid example to focus on a broader issue. It is claimed that a being whose internal cognitive architecture is accurately described as a connectionist network will not meet the necessary condition for being a thinker that the argument seeks to establish.\\n\\nThe broader issue that connectionism highlights is this: Is it philosophically acceptable for an a priori argument to render it epistemically possible that we might not be believers or thinkers? A significant source of resistance to our argument for the LOT hypothesis is the belief that this is unacceptable; that it is inherent in our conception of a believer or thinker that we are the paradigm exemplars. According to this view, the proposition that we are believers is philosophically non-negotiable.\\n\\nIndeed, philosophers with any Wittgensteinian inclinations may feel uneasy about our argument. Order might emerge from chaos, or it might arise from order. It is an a posteriori matter which of these is the case. Part of the message of Zettel (Wittgenstein, 1981) is, perhaps, that philosophers should not insist that the system must \"continue further in the direction of the center.\" The invitation to eliminativism then presents itself as the consequence of ignoring that message.\\n\\nHowever, despite these doubts, we can reassure ourselves with two thoughts. First, it is possible to defend against eliminativism without rejecting our argument. Second, blanket immunity against eliminativism comes at a steep price. These two claims will be briefly defended in the next (and final) section.',\n"," '# Defending Belief\\n\\nThere are two primary strategies for defending against eliminativism while accepting our argument for the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis. However, one of these can be quickly dismissed.\\n\\nThe first strategy involves adopting an a priori stance regarding the future of science. This approach suggests that we should consider the possibility that evidence might accumulate in favor of the hypothesis that our internal cognitive architecture does not meet the conditions necessary for being a believer, as outlined in our argument. In other words, it is conceivable that we could gather evidence such that, all else being equal, the best explanation would be that the LOT hypothesis is false. However, in such a situation, we should argue that all else is not equal, and we have reason to maintain that what would otherwise be the best explanation is not the correct one.\\n\\nIf our argument for the LOT hypothesis were based on empirical evidence, this strategy might be viable. In the face of strong empirical evidence, claiming that evidence might accumulate against the LOT hypothesis would seem to beg the question. However, since the original argument is a priori, this strategy is merely an unjustifiable refusal to accept an inference to the best explanation.\\n\\nTherefore, in the context of an invitation to eliminativism stemming from an a priori argument, this first defensive strategy is not recommended.\\n\\nThe second defensive strategy against eliminativism involves a two-pronged approach.\\n\\nOne component of this approach is to revisit empirical considerations in favor of the LOT hypothesis. These considerations can support the view that it is empirically unlikely for the observed behavior to occur reliably without an internal architecture that meets the LOT\\'s requirements. Thus, empirical arguments for the LOT are not rendered redundant by our proposal for an a priori argument.\\n\\nIn fact, empirical arguments for the LOT can be divided into two types. Some arguments take the form of a \"How else?\" challenge. In the context of a developing alternative paradigm like connectionism, this type of argument may seem to beg the question.\\n\\nHowever, other arguments involve detailed evaluations of the performance of connectionist models that deviate from the paradigm of rules, representations, systematicity, and syntax. Suppose that analysis of network performance reveals aspects attributable to the departure from systematicity and syntax, which differ significantly from human performance. In that case, this would argue against connectionism becoming the dominant paradigm for modeling human cognitive processes.\\n\\nThis idea of a network\\'s performance aspect attributable to the departure from systematicity and syntax can be illustrated as follows:\\n\\nThe distinction between causally systematic processes and others is drawn to distinguish between two systems with the same input-output relation. However, in real cases, it is highly likely that a departure from causal systematicity will manifest in a system\\'s input-output relation, especially when novel inputs are presented.\\n\\nFor example, consider the past tense (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986). Suppose the transitions from regular verbs to their past tenses have a common causal explanation: a common mechanism mediates these transitions. It follows that the input states for such verbs must share a common property (a symbol indicating the verb is regular) to engage that mechanism. If a new verb is presented and the input state has that property, the verb will be given a past tense like all other regular verbs.\\n\\nThe situation differs if there is only a family resemblance among the transitions for various regular verbs. In this case, the family resemblance is dictated by similarities among input states, where those states are patterns of activation over units that respond to microfeatures. If a new verb is presented, the transition to a past tense is conditioned by the microfeatural similarity of the new verb to others. If the new verb is microfeaturally different from other regular verbs, it is likely to be given a past tense differently.\\n\\nThus, the highly deviant treatment of novel verbs that are microfeaturally remote from familiar examples—an aspect of the Rumelhart and McClelland network\\'s performance—is attributable to the departure from the rules and representations paradigm. If human performance differs significantly from that of the network in this respect, as Pinker and Prince (1988) argue, it lends non-question-begging support to the \"How else?\" challenge.\\n\\nThis concludes the first component of the two-pronged approach.\\n\\nThe second component involves pointing out that connectionist networks that do not employ syntactically structured vehicles of semantic content are susceptible to analyses of their internal operation, such as cluster analysis or receptive field analysis. In some cases, these analyses vindicate higher levels of description where a system meets the LOT\\'s requirements, even if realized in a connectionist substructure.\\n\\nIn other cases, analyses reveal that the network can be seen as composed of two devices. One is a front-end recognition device that is entirely connectionist. The second device meets the LOT\\'s requirements at some level of description and takes the recognition network\\'s outputs as inputs.\\n\\nIn short, the requirements of syntax and systematicity are typically unmet at the level of description of networks in terms of units, connections, activation, and weights. However, this does not rule out the possibility that some analysis of a network\\'s operation may vindicate a higher level of description, where approximate and blurred commonalities are variable realizations of real commonalities (see Clark, 1989, 1990; Davies, 1990b, 1990c).\\n\\nThis concludes the second component of the two-pronged approach.\\n\\nIf successful, this approach makes it highly probable that we are indeed believers, or more accurately, that we meet the particular necessary condition uncovered by our a priori argument.\\n\\nThus, the tension between the connectionist program and the common-sense scheme can be reduced, though not entirely eliminated. There is no absolute guarantee that if we have connectionist networks in our heads, they will meet the requirements of syntax and systematicity (or propositional modularity) at some vindicated level of description. We must accept the possibility that empirical discoveries about cognitive architecture may conflict with our common-sense conception of ourselves.',\n"," \"# The Dissatisfied Critic\\n\\nConsider a scenario where someone argues that the second defensive strategy—the pincer movement—is inadequate in respecting the intuition that our status as exemplars of belief is non-negotiable.\\n\\nTo address this, we might acknowledge that what the critic deems non-negotiable functions as a foundational assumption in our use of concepts like thinker, believer, or concept deployer. This would mean accepting that these concepts are meaningless unless they apply to us. However, if the critic remains unsatisfied with this presuppositional approach, we must contend that pursuing their desired direction would lead to its own set of intolerable issues.\\n\\nIf it is to be non-negotiably true that those of us who exhibit interpretable behavior are thinkers, then the concept of a thinker must not impose any necessary conditions beyond behavior. Specifically, it should not impose any necessary conditions on internal cognitive architecture. This implies that the critic is advocating for a form of behaviorism—not analytical behaviorism, but a doctrine that could be termed supervenient behaviorism.\\n\\nThis form of behaviorism is arguably at odds with common sense. Hypothetical examples of entities that produce appropriate behavior through unconventional internal architectures—such as Block's (1981) string-searching machine or Peacocke's (1983) Martian marionette—demonstrate that supervenient behaviorism conflicts with our intuitions about thinkers. Ultimately, if the choice is between behaviorism and confronting eliminativism, many of us know which path we would choose.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the dissatisfied critic must remain dissatisfied. Absolute immunity against eliminativism cannot be achieved.\",\n"," '# Homunculi\\n\\nConsider a psychological question of the form, \"How does $S$ accomplish $\\\\varnothing$?\" Here, $S$ represents either an individual organism or a type of organism, and $\\\\varnothing$ refers to some achievement or activity performed by that organism, characterized by intelligent and/or intentional behavior. Examples include: \"How do dogs recognize individual smells?\"; \"How does a homing pigeon navigate over miles of unfamiliar terrain?\"; \"How do English speakers understand novel sentences?\"; \"How does an experimental subject estimate the distance from their current location to their birthplace?\"; \"How did Richard Feynman solve physics puzzles?\"; and even, \"How does your chess program evaluate the potential for castling?\" \\n\\nIn philosophy and the history of psychology, answers to such questions have often been inadequate, merely deferring the problem by suggesting an internal homunculus responsible for the task, without further explanation. For instance, \"How does one recognize a person not seen in a long time?\" might be answered with, \"One forms a mental image and compares it to the physical person.\" This implies an internal mechanism capable of recognition, which is unsatisfactory. Such explanations have been criticized by Ryle (1949), Skinner (1964), and others as pseudo-explanatory and empty, leading to a negative view of homunculi as internal devices defined by their roles.\\n\\nAttneave, however, suggested that homunculi can be useful if their functions do not merely mimic the intelligent capacities being explained. A subject\\'s intelligent performance can be understood as the combined result of several simpler performances by sub-agencies acting together. Instead of positing a single homunculus responsible for an activity, we can refer to a team of homunculi, each specialized and less talented, working collaboratively. The functions of these team members are specified first, and then the explanation details how they cooperate to produce the more complex intelligent activity.\\n\\nTo improve upon the earlier example, consider a hypothetical explanation of my ability to recognize faces under controlled conditions: If I am in face-recognition mode (as determined by my master conation-organizing unit) and presented with a person\\'s head, my executive routine calls a viewpoint locator. This locator uses simple cues (such as nasal protrusion and light-dark contrast) to determine the head\\'s orientation: front view, left profile, right profile, or none of these. If the head is in one of the designated orientations, a 2-D physiognomic display is created and analyzed by a display analyzer, which codes the display\\'s content in an efficient storage vocabulary. A librarian then checks this coded formula against stored formulas in the \"face\" subdirectory of my visual memory. If a match is found, the librarian informs my public relations officer, who reads the tag and issues phonological instructions to my speech center. Depending on my wishes, my speech center may or may not vocalize these instructions.\\n\\nFor any functionary in this scenario, we might ask how it performs its specific job. This is another psychological question similar to the first, but about the functional organization of one of my component homunculi. For example, how does the display analyzer work? It might use a projector to impose a grid on the visual display and a scanner to evaluate the darkness/lightness of each grid square. How does the scanner work? It could be a simple light meter registering darkness/lightness and recording digitized values (such as 1 or 0, or more sensitive values like integral multiples of 0.1).\\n\\nWe can continue asking functional-analytical questions extensively. What neural structures realize the scanner and light meter? How does the light meter work? Perhaps through photosensitive chemicals. Which chemical? Suppose it\\'s XYZ. What about XYZ allows it to respond to light? Further questions would delve into physical chemistry, atomic physics, and microphysics, though psychologists may lose interest before reaching such depths.\\n\\nData for homuncular psychology are diverse and not limited to the gross behaviors typically examined by Analytical Behaviorists and folk psychology. They include subtle behavioral phenomena observed in laboratories, psychometric results, dysfunction evidence from lesion studies, effects of drugs on nonverbal behavior and introspective reports, and more. Additionally, evidence from invasive and noninvasive studies of brain structure is relevant, though connecting abstract homuncular organization to neural detail can be challenging.',\n"," '\\\\section*{FUNCTION-ANALYTICAL EXPLANATION}\\n\\nIt\\'s crucial to recognize that the function-analytical style of explanation is not exclusive to psychology. This approach is prevalent in systems theory, particularly when applied to artifacts. It is especially relevant for understanding computers, but it is also beneficial for explaining devices and machines in general. In electronics, explanations are typically function-analytical, as they are in auto mechanics. For instance, an automobile operates by having a fuel reservoir, a fuel line, a carburetor, a combustion chamber, an ignition system, a transmission, and wheels that turn. To understand how a carburetor functions, one would learn about its components and how they work together to infuse oxygen into fuel, among other details.\\n\\nFunction-analytical explanation is also pervasive in biology, as argued by Wimsatt (1972, 1976) and Cummins (1975). To illustrate, consider the elimination of wastes and toxins from the human body. This process is understood by analyzing the excretory system, which initially separates water-soluble from non-soluble products. Soluble wastes are processed by the kidney, which consists of a filter (the renal cortex) and a collector (the medulla). The filter uses a pressurizer (realized for each nephron by a contractile muscular cuff) to further separate wastes from blood cells and larger blood proteins, pushing them into the collector. Additional details are explained through the unique anatomical properties of specialized cells, which are further elucidated by the physical chemistry of cell membranes, and so on.\\n\\nEven though psychology does not delve into atomic physics, there is a considerable amount of hierarchical detail within the lower, more biological layers of psychological explanation. Psychological states and events are realized in neural structures, some of which are specifically located, while others are diffusely distributed. Neural structures consist of networks and fibers, whose behavior is explained in terms of the neurons and other cells that compose them (notably, \"neuron\" and \"cell\" are still functional terms). A cell performs its function through the cooperative action of its membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, and other components. It is an intriguing and debated question how far down this explanatory hierarchy one can go while still engaging in psychological explanation. This question is not merely semantic, as it partly depends on whether the specifics of intracellular activity are relevant to larger, behavioral phenomena that are clearly part of psychology\\'s domain.\\n\\nIn any case, psychological, biological, and mechanical systems are hierarchically organized, often following the principle of \"hierarchical control,\" a concept familiar to computer scientists.',\n"," '\\\\section*{HF and the Mind/Body Problem}\\n\\nHFist philosophy of mind addresses the mind/body problem by identifying mental states and events with homuncular states and events. To be in a mental state of type $M$ means that one\\'s $\\\\varnothing$-er is in a characteristic functional state. The \"is\" in this context refers to metaphysical identity.\\n\\nThe functionalist aspect of HF lies in its identification of mental items based on their functional relationships with other mental items, as well as sensory inputs and motor outputs. This is a well-established concept. What distinguishes HF as homuncular is its robust interpretation of \"function,\" which is defined in terms of the roles and responsibilities of subpersonal and sub-subpersonal agencies that make up the psychological subject\\'s internal structure. HF does not view this as mere fiction or metaphor; it takes these teleological characterizations seriously. If one criticizes this approach as presumptuous or far-fetched, the HFist would argue that biology is already deeply intertwined with natural teleological ascriptions, which are essential for understanding biological phenomena. Without these ascriptions, we would lose valuable generalizations that are crucial for making sense of biological processes. The naturalistic metaphysical explanation of teleology is a separate issue, and HF acknowledges its dependence on the validity of such explanations.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Advantages of HF as a Metaphysics of Mind}\\n\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item HF provides a psychological explanation in a function-analytical style. As Cummins (1983) argued, older materialist theories of the mind, not to mention immaterialist theories, only supported the Positivist D-N model of explanation. This model, which involves subsuming data under increasingly broad universal generalizations, is restrictive for both psychology and biology. HF metaphysics, however, liberates the concept of psychological (or biological) laws from similar Positivist constraints and counters skeptical challenges to this notion (Davidson, 1970; Lycan, 1981b).\\n\\n\\\\item Attneave\\'s original breakdown strategy effectively addresses the standard regress objection to homuncular explanation. It also tackles the profound metaphysical question of how intelligence, even in extraordinary degrees in some subjects, can emerge from a mass of insentient, nonintelligent molecules. A homuncular breakdown ultimately analyzes intelligent beings into sub-sub-\"agencies,\" any of which, as Dennett puts it, \"can be replaced by a machine.\"\\n\\n\\\\item Earlier versions of functionalism treated functional realization—the relationship between a physical organism and the abstract program it was said to instantiate—as a simple one-to-one correspondence between the organism\\'s physical stimuli, structural states, and behavior, and the program\\'s defining input/state/output function. This criterion was quickly deemed too liberal, as virtually anything can correlate one-to-one with virtually anything else, making \"realization\" too easily attainable (Block, 1981; Lycan, 1987, chap. 3). HF addresses this by imposing a teleological requirement on realization: a physical state of an organism realizes a functional description only if the organism has genuine organic integrity and the state fulfills its functional role properly for the organism, in a teleological sense. This requirement effectively excludes some plausible counterexamples that show less demanding notions of realization are too liberal.\\n\\n\\\\item Previous functionalist theories offered a simplistic two-leveled view of human psychobiology: functional states, which type-reduced mental states, were seen as codified in a machine program; the mental was viewed as software running on neurophysiological hardware at a single \"computational\" level of abstract description. This view is extremely unbiological. Neither living organisms nor computers are divided into a purely \"structural\" level of biological/physiochemical description and a single \"abstract\" computational level of machine/psychological description. Instead, they are hierarchically organized at multiple levels, each abstract relative to those below it but structural or concrete as it realizes levels above it. HF allows us to see the functional/structural or software/hardware distinction as entirely relative to a chosen level of organization.\\n\\n\\\\item Recognizing this relativity enables the HFist to address several objections against two-leveled versions of functionalism (Lycan, 1987, chap. 5), particularly those based on the \"qualia\" or \"feels\" of mental states (see also Sober, 1985). HF can dismantle false dilemmas posed to functionalism by critics who assume that mental states must either be located at an MIT-style level of computation over very abstract representations or be a matter of type-reduction to neurophysiology (such as Block, 1978, 1980; see particularly his \"Problem of the Inputs and the Outputs\"). There is no reason to assume that \"the mental\" is all ontologically located at the same level of organization or to deny the existence and importance of many levels between the very abstract-computational and the neurophysiological.\\n\\n\\\\item Van Gulick (1980), Millikan (1984), Fodor (1984), Dretske (1986), and others have argued convincingly that teleology must be part of any adequate analysis of the intentionality of mental states. According to teleological theorists, a neurophysiological state should be considered about, say, peanuts, only if under normal conditions where the subject\\'s relevant agencies function properly, that state exists in an epistemically suitable relation to (actual) peanuts. This view allows naturalistic theories to account for false intentional content. While not without difficulties, no other naturalistic theory of intentionality seems as promising.\\n\\nIn conclusion, HF is a compelling theory of mind and a metaphysical framework for psychology. While I am biased, I argue that HF is the leading realist theory of the mind, with its main competition coming from instrumentalist and eliminativist perspectives. My current task is to examine the contemporary Connectionist model of functional organization as it relates to psychology and assess its compatibility with the HFist paradigm. I aim to explore the relationship between the two; if tension arises, I will not attempt to defend one view at the expense of the other here.',\n"," '# Against Two-Levelism\\n\\nThe first crucial point to understand is the significant similarity between Connectionism and Hierarchical Functionalism (HF): both reject the \"two-levelist\" characteristic often associated with earlier forms of functionalism. The Connectionist model provides a clear, concrete example of the HFist perspective on the importance of intermediate levels of organization, which lie between the highly abstract computational levels described by what Haugeland (1985) refers to as GOFAI—Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence—and the actual neuron-by-neuron physiological structure.\\n\\nFor too long, though really only about a decade, the philosophy of cognitive science has perpetuated a set of interrelated, impressionistic distinctions: software versus hardware; top-down versus bottom-up; abstract computation over predicate-calculus formulas versus biological cell chemistry; printed circuitry versus living organisms; high-tech computer centers versus animal care facilities; MIT versus Southern California. The tensions between \"top-downers\" and \"bottom-uppers\" were perhaps exaggerated for effect. Among philosophers, the arch-top-downer Jerry Fodor once publicly declared that the brain is \"a junkyard\" and should be ignored by psychologists, while Paul Churchland has advocated for the elimination of all human sciences except brain science. However, these tensions were real.\\n\\nSome early Connectionists explicitly claimed to be engaged in \"neural modeling,\" sharply opposing traditional cognitivist AI and aligning themselves with the bottom-uppers. More recently, however, Connectionists and their supporters have begun to reject such stereotypes. For instance, Smolensky (1988) acknowledges the rich multiplicity of levels in nature and attempts to clarify the relationships between several of these levels as they are simulated in connectionist computer programs. It is generally accepted that typical connectionist networks are not literal neural models but are abstract and general descriptions of brain function. In particular, \"units\" (especially those with individual representational properties) are more abstract than single neurons and are more similar in their semantic properties to the traditional internal representations of philosophers and GOFAI.\\n\\nFurthermore, as far as is known, actual neural networks are not governed by externally imposed learning algorithms like \"back-propagation.\" This significant difference is obscured by the fact that learning algorithms are not depicted in illustrations of the connectionist networks they drive. If one were to build an actual connectionist system, rather than simulating one on a digital computer and having the computer also draw a picture of the network, one would need to incorporate the learning algorithm, as well as the biases and connection strengths. This would be no trivial task, as outputs would need to be physically matched against the \"correct\" answers, and the result of the match would then need to be physically parsed into reset instructions for numerous individual connections, which would then need to be physically enforced on the actual connections themselves. More differences between connectionist models and actual neural structures are cataloged by Smolensky (1988, p. 9; see also Crick, 1989).\\n\\nThe same is true for some other abstract \"neural\" models, such as Paul Churchland\\'s (1986) \"phase-space sandwich\" theory of sensorimotor coordination, based on the neurophysiological work of Pellionisz and Llinas (1979, 1982, 1985), and other models featuring coordinate transformation. These models are not literally neural but are far more abstract. Since it is unquestionable that the brain often works by coordinate transformation, at least a measure of neural plausibility is assured for coordinate-transformation theories. However, coordinate transformation itself is biocomputation abstractly described, not neuron-by-neuron physiology, and it functions teleologically as such. Thus, contrary to the spirit of some of Churchland\\'s speculations, it is entirely compatible with HF. A neural structure that topologically transforms, for example, a sequential pattern of receptor inputs into a 2-D spatial map is, in its own way, a cartographer.\\n\\nTherefore, down with Two-Levelism, and may confusion and diminishing income befall its proponents.',\n"," '# Connectionism and Teleology\\n\\nIn this section, I will explore some remaining issues related to connectionism and teleology, offering preliminary remarks on each.\\n\\nHomuncular Functionalism posits that psychological and biological entities are organisms in a robust sense: they are teleologically integrated systems of organs, each defined by its specific functions. These organs are composed of smaller organs, creating a hierarchical structure. But how does this concept apply to connectionism?\\n\\nA connectionist network can indeed function as an organ, meaning an organ could be structured like a connectionist network without any inherent conflict. A slightly more intriguing question is whether the components of a connectionist network can themselves be considered organs in a teleological sense. Do they serve the network as units and connections? In biological systems, there seems to be no reason why they couldn\\'t. Connectionist networks are highly integrated systems, and their presence in biological organisms is presumably not accidental.\\n\\nA more compelling question is whether an individual unit within a network has a specific function. Even if units generally serve the network, it may not be possible to assign a unique function to each one. In \"localist\" connectionist systems, where units are linked to specific propositions, this association can be seen as a representational function. The same applies to \"global representation\" systems, where units represent small bits of information or complex disjunctions of real-world propositions. This piecemeal representation, however modest, can be considered functional.\\n\\nWhat about units that do not represent anything, even in a fragmented or disjunctive manner? Some proponents of connectionism, following the traditions of Wittgenstein and Ryle, aim to understand intelligent behavior without relying on internal representations. As Stanley Munsat has noted, connectionism is \"AI for Wittgensteinians,\" offering \"representation without representation.\" A stronger thesis might argue that no part of a connectionist network, even a large distributed part, represents anything.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s unclear if non-representing units exist in a network that processes representations as input and output. First, no connectionist researcher I\\'ve encountered avoids representational language. Once a network is trained, its creators naturally use intentional ascription, which aids further investigation and use. Second, even if a researcher personally refrains from ascribing content to units, one could argue that, given a representational interpretation of inputs and outputs, an interpretation for any unit can be constructed once the system is fully trained (as suggested by Clark in this volume).\\n\\nAssuming this view is correct, it doesn\\'t necessarily mean a unit\\'s function is to carry its algorithmically constructed content. This content might be seen as a form of pleiotropism. It need not be true that under normal circumstances, a unit would carry that content, so it doesn\\'t have that job in a strong sense. However, since a unit carries content as a result of the network\\'s proper functioning and its role within the network, there may be a weaker, derivative sense of \"function\" to consider. Further distinctions are likely needed.\\n\\nA final caution on this unresolved issue: Questions of organhood and function differ from those of morphological salience and modularity. An organ need not be physically localized within its system; especially in the brain, neural patterns may have specific functions at certain times but be diffusely distributed. Moreover, an organ need not be modular in a technical sense, such as Jerry Fodor\\'s (1983) concept of informational encapsulation; some organs may freely exchange information with many others, as seen in the human speech center.',\n"," '\\\\section*{FOLK PSYCHOLOGY}\\n\\nLet\\'s examine how Hierarchical Functionalism (HF) and Connectionism relate to folk psychology.\\n\\nNeither model inherently challenges the validity of folk psychology. However, historically, proponents of HF, particularly philosophers, have approached their top-down strategy by starting with categories that align with folk psychology. For instance, when outlining the sub-personal structure of a human subject, Dennett (1978, chap. 9) refers to components such as a \"higher executive or Control component,\" a \"short-term memory store or buffer memory,\" a \"perceptual analysis component,\" a \"problem-solving component,\" and a \"print-out component\" or speech center. HF, as I have intended it, seeks a conservative reduction of these categories through functional analysis, rather than reducing them to neurophysiological types.\\n\\nIn contrast, advocates of Connectionism often view their perspective as opposing folk psychology. For example, P. S. Churchland (1986) and others argue that there is a fundamental conflict. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon (in this volume) assert that the conception of propositional attitudes supported by a central class of connectionist models does not align with the requirements of folk psychology.\\n\\nThere is no inherent conflict between HF and Connectionism, as a psychologist could work within the HF framework without considering folk notions, and a proponent of folk psychology could implement models using a connectionist architecture with \"local representation\" (as Thagard, 1989, does). The conflict arises when: (a) HF aligns with a version of folk psychology and specific claims are attributed to it, (b) HF adopts a non-folk-psychological view of cognition that still makes specific claims about internal representation, or (c) a version of Connectionism is developed that explicitly or implicitly contradicts those claims. Ramsey et al. aim to achieve (c), focusing on contrasting folk and connectionist views of mental representation. Let\\'s delve into this topic further.',\n"," '# Propositional Attitudes\\n\\nHomuncular Functionalism (HF) does not inherently address the propositional attitudes of folk psychology. Ramsey et al. do not dispute HF itself. Folk psychology also lacks specificity regarding propositional attitudes; various realist and instrumentalist or interpretivist views have been proposed to capture the common-sense conception. However, a particular realist view aligns well with HF, which I have previously advocated (Lycan, 1981c, 1988). This view posits that beliefs and other attitudes are internal representations, stored and manipulated by organs designed for these functions. As Sellars (1956) and his followers in philosophy and cognitive science suggest, beliefs and thoughts are physical inner states with propositional content and causal powers. Additionally, they have functions, at least in a derivative sense, as products of generalized cognitive devices with specific functions. We can imagine a \"belief box\" for storing information and mapping the external world, along with an inference machine and other information manipulators, all connected to perception and memory. Let\\'s refer to this as Representationalist HF (RHF) and explore its relation to Connectionism.\\n\\nConnectionist researchers have varying ideas about internal representation. Some programs feature local representation, where individual units have propositional or conceptual content, like \"dog,\" \"cup,\" or \"The butler did it.\" Other programs feature global representation, where representation is distributed over large, vague network portions, and individual units do not correspond to everyday concepts. There are two subcases of global representation.\\n\\nFirst, in a conservative approach, individual units may not express everyday concepts but correspond to fine-grained features of the subject matter, perceptible to analysts but not explicitly recognized by ordinary people. For example, Rumelhart and McClelland\\'s (1986) phonetic past-tense-forming network focuses on features like \"roundedness preceded by frontalness and followed by backness.\" In such models, individual units represent, but not in the way folk-psychological beliefs typically do. This is \"weakly global\" representation.\\n\\nIn other systems, representation is more radically distributed, with individual units not representing at all, or so it is claimed. This is \"strongly global\" representation. If a reliable method exists to construct unit content from input and output content after training, then contrary to the modelers\\' claims, there is no strongly global representation, only the weak variety. However, we remain agnostic on this issue.\\n\\nSmolensky (1988) defends a version of global representation, competing with and surpassing RHF. He distinguishes between the \"symbolic\" or GOFAI paradigm and the \"subsymbolic\" paradigm, arguing that real cognition is subsymbolic. The effective causal action is in the connectionist architecture at the \"subconceptual\" level; \"conceptual\" cognition, in the sense of folk psychology or GOFAI, is at best an epiphenomenon. Only the subconceptual level provides \"[c]omplete, formal, and precise descriptions of the intuitive processor\" (Smolensky, 1988, pp. 6-7); in a sense, only subconceptual cognition and causation are real.\\n\\nYet Smolensky acknowledges that actual representation occurs within the so-called subconceptual level, and connectionist models focus on determinate fine-grained features of the task subject matter. Thus, Smolensky discusses weakly global representation.\\n\\nHow do weakly global systems relate to RHF? Such systems mobilize subconceptual concepts, fine-grained rather than the grosser concepts prominent in everyday thinking. These concepts do not occur in the subject\\'s working vocabulary, suggesting that subconceptual states in a weakly global connectionist model are not beliefs in either the RHFist sense or folk psychology.\\n\\nTwo RHFist responses are possible. The first is perhaps disappointingly concessive: The RHFist may argue that common sense is wrong about the contents of human beliefs; perceptual beliefs are about fine-grained features, and more abstract beliefs about the middle-sized world must be inferred or constructed by unknown mechanisms.\\n\\nSecond, encouraged by the fine-grained content of individual units, the RHFist may propose an Implementation thesis: that propositional representation of the folk and/or GOFAI sort exists but is often realized at a lower level of functional organization by a structure of Smolensky\\'s subconceptual, fine-grained representations. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) argued that if cognition is to have the properties of productivity and systematicity characterizing folk-psychological thinking—a big \"if\" for those who see Connectionism as refuting or embarrassing folk psychology—a connectionist model of thinking must be seen as implementing a higher-level system of commonsensical and/or GOFAI representation.\\n\\nBechtel (1987, 1988) observed that this implementation need not be \"mere\" in the sense that underlying connectionist details can be ignored. These details may play an important explanatory role in psychology: We may need to reference connectionist substructure to explain some higher-level relationships. Moreover, cognitive capacities like pattern recognition, which have resisted GOFAI, cannot be reconstructed as governed by traditional semantic rules. One might try to abstract such higher-level rules and fail; as Bechtel says, \"[i]t would also seem wasteful to try to realize these properties through a complex rule system when they might already be provided at a lower level in the architecture\" (1988, p. 9).\\n\\nIt is useful to distinguish psychological capacities linked to human language from those that are not. The former presuppose language use or would not have been acquired without learning a public language. Churchland and Churchland (1983) remind us that language is a late development, idiosyncratic to one species, and our language-linked capacities are likely idiosyncratic too. We should not take them as a model for all intelligent abilities (see also Dennett, 1986, this volume). It is more plausible to think of rules-and-representations structures in humans as sitting atop a more ubiquitous, brain-like architecture shared across species. Non-language-linked cognitive capacities shared with higher animals may be a function of connectionist architecture without higher-level representational organization.\\n\\nThe first response (conceding that perceptual beliefs are fine-grained) does not detract from HF or RHF, neither of which claims anything about the exact subject matter of internal representations. It may affront folk psychology, which holds that beliefs are about tables, chairs, and people rather than \"fine-grained features.\" The second response is more congenial, for if the Implementation thesis is true, Connectionism is compatible with RHF and, as shown, with all of folk psychology.\\n\\nOne might argue that the topology is wrong; symbolic-paradigm or GOFAI computation is linear, proof-like, discrete, monotonic, etc., whereas connectionist computation does not involve manipulating syntactically structured symbols according to rules based on structural elements. It seems to involve causal, associationist excitatory and inhibitory links between (sub-)symbols. But if \"sub\"-symbols are still representors manipulated according to precise rules, they are still symbols, expressing concepts in any traditional sense. The only question is what the rules are. A partisan of the first response can accept that they are associationist rather than proof-theoretic. An advantage is that subsymbol-relating associationist norms are less often violated than predicate calculus inference rules, though some would be violated in network damage cases. A partisan of the second, Implementationist response has an easier time with weakly global representation: If Smolensky\\'s subsymbols implement folk-psychological and/or GOFAI representations at a higher level, then the connection strengths, biases, and other associationist elements likely implement a system of higher-level representations with constituent structure and inference patterns. It is hard to imagine a system of everyday human concepts and propositional contents—however implemented—that does not exhibit standard inferential relations; some philosophers have implied that this is conceptually impossible (Sellars, 1963; Davidson, 1974; Dennett, 1978).\\n\\nSmolensky resists my conclusions, arguing that \"symbolic\" or traditional descriptions of cognition are not \"[c]omplete, formal, and precise\" (especially regarding inference) and are not strictly implemented but are vague, statistical, and nearly epiphenomenal.\\n\\nSmolensky\\'s standards of precision are high. If imposed across all levels of nature where we hypothesize stable entities and generalizations—cold fronts, economic depressions, baseball games, divorces, department meetings, ocean waves, shoeshines, and mud puddles—these items would be seen as vague, statistical, and nearly epiphenomenal. None would be implemented in Smolensky\\'s strong sense.\\n\\nRegarding causality, little or no strict causation would occur between such entities (cf. Davidson, 1970), only crude supervenient causation. Yet most causation concerning us in everyday life is crude-supervenient rather than strict or \"real\" causation. The lack of strictness and precision is no embarrassment to RHF or folk psychology, though it may hinder a more ambitious form of GOFAI as an algorithmically precise system of real-world representation.',\n"," '\\\\section*{MORPHOLOGICAL INTEGRITY}\\n\\nThe issue of morphology is significant in the context of representation paradigms. In the symbolic paradigm, a representation token is a distinct and identifiable segment of hardware at any given time. Conversely, in the sub-symbolic paradigm, which supports weakly global representation, the symbolic token is distributed or dispersed throughout the system, making it morphologically indistinct or invisible. This distinction is potentially important for fields like computer science and psychology, though its relevance to RHF or the broader theory of representation is less certain.\\n\\nThere are two notable implications of moving away from morphological localism. First, while the sub-symbolic paradigm allows for higher-level intentional reference to the external world by scattered regions of hardware, such reference cannot, according to Smolensky, be characterized using the computational terms typically associated with higher-level processes. Dennett (1986, p. 69) observed that the \"brain-thingamabob [that] refers to Chicago\" would need to be described statistically and in terms of the entire connectionist system or a substantial portion of it.\\n\\nIndeed, inferential relations at this higher level cannot be formalized with the precision required for actual machine computation. This challenges the notion that connectionist infrastructure can strictly implement GOFAI, assuming GOFAI necessitates algorithmically sound inferential relations between its higher-level representations. However, folk psychology and RHF can function without such precision.\\n\\nSecondly, the sub-symbolic paradigm complicates philosophical accounts of the intentionality of ordinary folk-psychological representations and similar constructs in standard \"symbolic\" theory. If brain representations of concepts like Chicago, peanuts, and the World Series are described statistically and in terms of a large portion of the connectionist system, simple \"indicator\" or causal-historical accounts of intentionality become inadequate. \"Aboutness\" must be attributed to large, diffuse masses of connectionist hardware, necessitating more abstract, teleological, and causal theories of intentionality to accommodate this complexity.',\n"," '**Functionally Discrete**\\n\\nPreviously, we discussed how a unified function does not necessarily imply morphological prominence. The absence of morphological prominence in representations is not inherently problematic for RHF.\\n\\nTo elaborate, as Ramsey et al. (this volume) acknowledge, \"functionally discrete coding may often be very hard to notice and cannot be expected to be visible upon causal inspection.\" For instance, a standard home computer stores sentences (such as those manipulated by a word processor) in a physically dispersed manner, using various memory addresses that are intricately linked. If one were to ask an expert technician where a specific sentence (e.g., \"With a gasp of relief, Reg unstrapped the slab of raw liver from his left shin\") is stored, the technician would likely have no idea and might doubt that the question has a straightforward factual answer. Yet, the sentence is stored in a functionally discrete manner; a few keystrokes can execute a word-processing operation on that sentence, such as moving it, underlining it, checking its spelling, or making it a separate paragraph.\\n\\nHowever, Ramsey et al. (this volume) remain skeptical:  \\n\"[W]e\\'re inclined to think that the burden of argument is on the [RHFist] critic to show that such a[n as yet undiscovered] system [of propositional encoding in a global connectionist network] is likely; in the absence of any serious reason to think that networks like ours do encode propositions in functionally discrete ways, the mere logical possibility that they might is hardly a serious threat.\"\\n\\nWhile Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s request for positive evidence is reasonable, it is somewhat overstated. The hypothesis of physically scattered but functionally discrete representation is more than a \"mere logical possibility,\" as ordinary digital computers already operate this way, and there is no reason to believe that any reasonably powerful computer will function differently.\\n\\nAdmittedly, conventional computers operate this way because they are programmed from the top down with rules and representations, whereas connectionist networks are trained using general learning algorithms. Yet, even in connectionist systems, morphological prominence can unexpectedly emerge at higher levels of organization.\\n\\nConsider the Chomskyan argument that where there is unbounded competence but only finite resources, there must be recursion on a finite stock of primitives. This principle clearly applies to language understanding, and Fodor and Pylyshyn extend it to the \"productivity\" of thinking. Connectionist architecture might be proposed as an alternative method for achieving unbounded competence from finite resources. However, it remains challenging to see how connectionist architecture alone could accomplish this. For example, when a subject hears a long, novel sentence and immediately produces an equally complex and contextually appropriate response, a Connectionist would argue that the response is mediated by the activation pattern on the system\\'s hidden units, without any mental morphemes or semantic primitives being abstracted from the activation pattern itself. This total non-abstractability seems unlikely. Consider NETtalk, a connectionist program that audibly pronounces English words from written text (Rosenberg, 1987; Rosenberg and Sejnowski, 1987).\\n\\nNETtalk\\'s achievement is impressive because, in a paradigmatically connectionist style, (a) the task is quirky, with the function from English spelling to oral pronunciation being highly irregular; (b) the function is many-to-many, as the pronunciation of a letter or letter group varies with lexical context; and (c) the machine is given no phonological rules or linguistic representations, only a general learning algorithm that adjusts activation levels between word-presentation trials. Initially, the feat seems magical. Philosophically, it appears to some as a Rylean/Wittgensteinian ideal—intelligent behavior unmediated by representations and rules.\\n\\nHowever, it is well known that mature NETtalk activation patterns at the hidden layer are partitioned into disjoint classes. There are 79 such classes, corresponding to the 79 distinct letter-to-phoneme conversions mastered by a competent English speaker. A cluster analysis by Rosenberg and Sejnowski (1987) revealed that these classes are grouped into two main superclasses and various hierarchical subdivisions. The two main superclasses correspond to English vowels and consonants, and the subdivisions align with familiar vowel and consonant subtypes. Thus, all the phonemes of English phonology emerge. Although NETtalk is not provided with phonological rules, it acquires phonological categories during learning, and it would not have achieved its success without them. Remarkably, these categories cannot be easily derived from the raw input, yet NETtalk acquires them, suggesting it possesses phonological concepts (though one might debate the computational properties required for a feature to qualify as a bona fide concept).\\n\\nSimilarly, one would expect familiar morphemes to emerge from a connectionist syntax and semantics for a general natural-language-understanding machine. This expectation is supported by the known psychological robustness of morphemes in humans. The natural-language-understanding capacity is a clear example of a \"language-linked\" capacity.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, I do not claim that the Implementation thesis universally holds, meaning that every connectionist network exhibits higher-level organization in terms of propositional representation. However, I predict this will generally be true for systems whose inputs, outputs, and correction feedback are understood semantically, and likely true for other language-linked capacities.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Distinctive Causal Powers}\\n\\nEven if connectionist networks contain functionally discrete yet dispersed representations, are these representations too diffusely scattered to possess distinctive causal powers? This largely depends on one\\'s perspective on causation. A scattered representation is not akin to a billiard ball or a lever. However, it does possess counterfactual and other subjunctive properties. If we accept that certain clusters of subjunctive properties can fulfill a genuinely, albeit modest, causal role, then it remains plausible to assert that scattered representations have distinctive causal powers.\\n\\nIt is important to note that, despite Ramsey, Stich, and Garon\\'s (this volume) assertion that common sense attributes distinctive causal roles to beliefs, common sense does not treat beliefs as mechanical components like billiard balls or levers. Folk wisdom does not depict a belief as a mechanical part of a person. It is not as if Erica\\'s belief activated part C, which then triggered engine E, and so forth. The intuitive causal role of a belief is instead \"modest,\" described only subjunctively: for instance, Erica would not have attended the meeting if she had not believed the Provost would be there. Therefore, the lack of a tangible, robust cog-like causal role in a scattered representation does not undermine the RHFist\\'s identification of a belief with it.\\n\\nMoreover, there is evidence suggesting that NETtalk and similar advanced systems, particularly linguistic ones, exhibit subjunctive properties of the appropriate kind. Consider two such systems that are very similar but differ slightly in their input-output (I-O) relations; perhaps the only noticeable difference is that one system responds appropriately to an input sentence that the other ignores. The linguistic properties of these systems supervene on their respective connectionist architectures, including their actual and subjunctive linguistic differences. Consequently, there must be systematic subjunctive differences in the two activation patterns, regardless of how holistically these differences are characterized; no I-O difference can exist without a structural difference. Since the I-O difference is characterized strictly syntactically/semantically, it is highly likely that the underlying structural difference would also occupy a syntactic/semantic niche. (Recall the Chomskyan argument; the systematic subjunctive differences would presumably constitute differences in semantic elements. Jay Rosenberg has noted in conversation that, in the case of human language, the back-propagation of error used to train connectionist networks is conducted in semantic terms, such as through misunderstanding or correction.)\\n\\nNETtalk serves as an example: if it did not acquire its aforementioned phonological categories, then (in light of supervenience) its mature activation patterns would have to be different; and if its mature activation patterns were significantly different, NETtalk would not produce the impressive outputs it does. Thus, on at least one modest subjunctive notion of causality, NETtalk\\'s phonological categories are causally involved in the production of its output.\\n\\nSimilar observations apply to Ramsey et al.\\'s example (this volume) of Network A and Network B, which differ only in that B encodes an additional proposition not present in A. When questioning whether B\\'s representation of the additional proposition has played a causal role in producing a particular output, Ramsey et al. (this volume) argue that it is \"quite senseless,\" as there is no \"identifiable\" substructure representing B\\'s proposition. Whether or not the representation is epistemically \"identifiable,\" Ramsey et al. have not demonstrated that it is metaphysically nonexistent or that it lacks a \"modest\" subjunctive-causal role, as common sense attributes to beliefs. It is very likely—again due to supervenience—that B would not exhibit the clearly identifiable extra semantic capacity it does if the scattered representation of the extra proposition did not exist.\\n\\nIn passing, Ramsey et al. raise a third issue closely related to functionally discrete and distinctive causal powers: that of natural kinds. They note that beliefs are commonly considered to comprise a natural kind, and that belief predicates are accordingly projectible in well-behaved generalizations (this volume). HF and certainly RHF agree with this view. Even a globalist Connectionism need not reject this claim, as it is only that belief is a well-behaved type of state (not: a type of well-behaved state), and even if individual beliefs are ill-behaved scattered representations, they are ill-behaved and scattered in generally the same ways. The real issue is whether the doxastic generalizations of folk psychology \"are couched in terms of the semantic properties of the attitudes\" (Ramsey et al., this volume, italics original).\\n\\nThis question further divides into two: whether \"belief that P\" is a natural kind, and whether beliefs exert their causal influence due to their exact propositional contents or truth-conditions. These are distinct questions. The first will be answered affirmatively if there exists an adequate \"psychosemantics\" in the sense of Fodor (1987, 1990), that is, a systematic naturalistic explication of mental reference or \"aboutness.\" In contrast, the second question would remain highly contentious even if a robust psychosemantics were firmly established; for although propositional and/or truth-conditional contents may feature in robust generalizations, the generalizations in which they appear need not be causal generalizations about individual bodily movements in response to stimuli. Indeed, contrary to Fodor\\'s (1980) seminal article, I interpret the lesson of the extensive methodological solipsism literature to be that, although beliefs are (however \"modestly\") causes, they do not exert their causal influence specifically by virtue of their propositional contents. If this is correct, then neither HF nor RHF, as I understand it, has any disagreement with Connectionism on this matter.',\n"," '\\\\section*{EXPLANATION}\\n\\nWe have observed that HF (Hierarchical Functionalism) provides a unique approach to psychological explanation. Does Connectionism offer a significantly different style of psychological explanation compared to HF? Not in a general sense, as Connectionist explanations are also broadly function-analytical. Both approaches align, provided Connectionists are open to a teleological characterization of connectionist architecture. An individual Connectionist who opposes teleology and rejects HF on that basis is entitled to their perspective but speaks only for themselves.\\n\\nMunsat (1988) argued that Connectionist explanations of intelligent capacities differ markedly from RHFist explanations of the same capacities. RHF (like any other version of the representationalist theory of thinking) describes semantic and other intelligent behaviors as products of internal symbol manipulation according to rules. This aligns with GOFAI (e.g., Newell & Simon, 1976), the \"language-of-thought\" view of mental representation, and perhaps folk psychology. The shared idea is that we exhibit semantic and intelligent behavior because something within us behaves semantically, if not entirely intelligently; the semantic properties of internal representations are to be explained independently (see footnote 13). In contrast, Connectionism posits that:\\n\\nOur observable symbol-manipulating capacities are not explained by underlying symbol-manipulating processes. Instead, explanation occurs when our cognitive capacities are shown to arise from structures with specific physical properties (e.g., activation levels, connection strengths, inhibitory or excitatory connections) organized and related in particular ways, where that organization and those relations can be altered by \"experience\" (Munsat, 1988, p. 4).\\n\\nConnectionist explanations are not conceptual and do not involve ordinary inference. (Cf. Smolensky\\'s claim that propositional inference is epiphenomenal in connectionist networks, even if propositional representation is not. A related thesis is discussed by Cummins & Schwarz, 1987).\\n\\nIf Munsat is correct about this distinction between Connectionist and RHF/GOFAI explanations, it is significant. As he notes, RHF/GOFAI explanations are limited in power: outwardly detectable semantics and intelligence are explained by similar internal processes, even though psychosemantics and HF will subsequently explicate the internal semantics and intelligence. The Connectionist explanation, framed entirely in terms of simple, non-intentional physical magnitudes, however abstract, is a deeper explanation for this reason. It is not merely more of the same and is more robustly causal. Thus, as a competing explanation, it prevails.\\n\\nMunsat\\'s point is valid as it stands. The question is whether Connectionist explanations genuinely compete with RHFist explanations. An Implementation theorist might argue that the two do not compete any more than atomic and traditional chemical explanations of the same chemical reaction do. The Connectionist explanation is deeper, true, but it misses higher-level generalizations and does not provide a rational sense to the system\\'s apparently rational output. Therefore, the higher-level representational explanation is also valuable.\\n\\nYet, as Munsat might argue, is it not the connectionist hardware that is truly doing the work? We may \"discern\" higher-level representational structure in the network once it has been trained, but that structure is subjective—seen by those who wish to see it but not part of what actually drives the system\\'s functionality.\\n\\nThis idea\\'s validity hinges on the Implementation thesis. If the thesis holds, then the higher-level structure exists and provides higher-level explanation, regardless of any particular observer\\'s interest. Moreover, if my earlier remarks on causality are correct, the sense in which the connectionist hardware is \"really doing the work\" is not particularly compelling: in the same sense, it is the atomic structure, not the chemical, that is \"really doing the work\" in chemical reactions.\\n\\nIt is too early to determine whether the Implementation thesis holds universally. I would be surprised if it did not; Ramsey et al. would be surprised if it did. A world with such potential for surprise is a pleasant world to inhabit.',\n"," '\\\\section*{2. THREE VERSIONS OF THE POVERTY OF THE STIMULUS ARGUMENT AND THREE LEVELS OF NATIVISM}\\n\\nWhat transformations occur when a child learns a language? The answer is multifaceted. The most noticeable change is that the child becomes capable of understanding the language, communicating effectively, and using it for various purposes. There are also subtler changes. Once a child has mastered a language, they can make a wide range of judgments about the properties and relationships of expressions within the language. For instance, English speakers can typically determine whether any given sequence of sounds forms a grammatical sentence in English. If it does, they can assess whether it is ambiguous. They can also judge whether two sentences are related as active and passive, as declarative and yes-no questions, whether one is a paraphrase of the other, whether one entails the other, and so on for numerous additional linguistic properties and relations. These judgments, often referred to as \\'linguistic intuitions,\\' have been central to generative linguistics since its inception.\\n\\nChomskyans argue that it is astonishing that ordinary speakers of a language can make an almost infinite number of judgments about the grammatical properties and relations of expressions in their language. The most plausible explanation for this ability, they suggest, is that speakers possess a generative grammar of their language—an explicit system of rules and definitions—stored in their mind or brain. According to Chomsky, \"the mature speaker has internalized a grammar with specific properties... [and] in understanding speech, he makes use of this grammar to assign a percept to a signal.\" To know a language is to be in a certain mental state, consisting of a system of rules and principles. This internally represented system of rules guides the complex and prolific linguistic judgments that speakers can make. It is also used in various ways in the more ordinary processes of language production and comprehension. Without an internally represented grammar, Chomsky and his followers argue, it remains a mystery how speakers can have the linguistic intuitions they possess. The mentally stored grammar is not consciously accessible. Speakers cannot articulate the rules of the grammar represented in their brains any more than they can explain how they recognize faces or retrieve salient information from memory. However, if speakers do have an internally represented grammar, a natural goal for generative grammarians would be (and has been) to discover that grammar—the grammar that is \\'psychologically real.\\'\\n\\nThe argument supporting the thesis that speakers have an internally represented generative grammar of their language takes the form of an inference to the best explanation:\\n\\n\"I know of no other account that even attempts to deal with the fact that our judgments and behavior accord with and are in part explained by certain rule systems.\"\\n\\nLater, we will discuss why many connectionists believe their models challenge this thesis. For now, however, let us assume that Chomsky is correct and that speakers indeed have a mentally stored grammar of their language. We can then explore the three versions of the poverty of the stimulus argument against the backdrop of the assumption that the mechanisms supporting language acquisition must be capable of producing the grammar that the child comes to internally represent.',\n"," '**2.1. The Argument for Minimal Nativism**\\n\\nThe most basic form of the poverty of the stimulus argument starts with the observation that, within the typical timeframe for language acquisition, a child encounters only a limited and often misleading set of linguistic data. This \\'poverty of the stimulus\\' arises from three key characteristics of the \\'primary linguistic data\\':\\n\\n1. The range of sentences that a fluent speaker of a language can use, understand, and provide linguistic insights about is vastly larger than the unique set of sentences children are exposed to while learning a language.\\n\\n2. During language acquisition, the speech children hear is not solely composed of complete grammatical sentences. Instead, they are often exposed to a variety of non-sentences, including slips of the tongue, incomplete thoughts, snippets of foreign languages, and even deliberate nonsense. Consequently, the data available to children for distinguishing sentences from non-sentences is notably disorganized.\\n\\n3. Unlike linguists, children are seldom informed that certain unusual and complex sentences are ungrammatical or that certain sentence pairs are paraphrases. Therefore, many types of data that linguists heavily rely on to choose between competing grammars—such as data derived from speakers\\' linguistic intuitions—are not accessible to children.\\n\\nThe fact that children can acquire a grammar based on this type of data suggests they possess a learning mechanism of some kind before the acquisition process begins. A video recorder exposed to the same primary linguistic data as a child does not develop an internally represented grammar, nor does a puppy or a young chimpanzee. The cognitive system a child uses for language learning must be capable of transforming a limited and disorganized sample of data into a grammar that generates most of the sentences in the data, as well as a vast number of additional sentences. Any cognitive system capable of extrapolating beyond the data in this manner must be reasonably sophisticated. Therefore, assuming that children do indeed develop an internally represented grammar, the \\'poverty of the stimulus\\' implies that children approach language learning with an innate learning mechanism of some sophistication. Furthermore, despite exposure to significantly different data samples, different children within the same linguistic community tend to develop essentially the same linguistic intuitions, suggesting they internalize essentially the same grammar. There is no evidence that children have a special predisposition to learn the language of their biological parents. For instance, Chinese children raised in an English-speaking environment learn English as easily as English children do. This indicates that the innate learning mechanisms enabling children to internalize the grammar of the language spoken around them are largely similar across all children.\\n\\nThe critical aspect of this initial version of the poverty of the stimulus argument is the observation that for the child\\'s innate learning mechanism to succeed, it must have a strong preference for acquiring certain grammars over others. This is because the data available by the time grammar acquisition is complete is compatible with an indefinitely large set of grammars, many of which differ significantly from the grammar the child ultimately acquires. The acquisition mechanism must extrapolate from the limited data to a correct grammar—one that classifies sentences in the same way as others in the linguistic community. Thus, it must somehow dismiss the vast array of incorrect grammars that are equally compatible with the data. The thesis we refer to as minimal nativism is simply the assertion that the child approaches language acquisition with an innate learning mechanism strongly biased towards certain grammars and against others. However, stating that the innate learning mechanism is biased towards certain grammars does not commit us to any specific explanation of the mechanism underlying this bias. It is on this point that the three levels of nativism differ. Minimal nativism merely asserts that the bias must exist. The higher levels of nativism make increasingly strong claims about the mechanism responsible for the bias.\\n\\nBefore proceeding to the next version of the argument, it is crucial to clarify what minimal nativism does and does not imply. One might assume that by establishing the existence of a strongly biased innate learning mechanism, Chomsky has succeeded in challenging the empiricist view of the mind. However, this would be a misunderstanding. Even the most committed empiricist would agree that learning requires sophisticated innate mechanisms and biases. As Quine reminds us, the empiricist \"is knowingly and cheerfully up to his neck in innate mechanisms of learning readiness.\" If Chomsky\\'s argument is intended to challenge empiricism, it must address the nature of these mechanisms and biases in a way that questions the empiricist conception of the mind.',\n"," '### 2.2. The Argument Against Empiricism\\n\\nAt first glance, it might seem impossible to argue against all empiricist accounts of the mind. While Chomsky might demonstrate that a specific empiricist theory fails to explain how the mind reliably produces the correct grammar from primary linguistic data, a resourceful empiricist could always devise another theory that adheres to empiricist principles, albeit differing from the refuted one. However, Chomsky presents an ingenious idea to circumvent this issue and refute all empiricist theories simultaneously. We will refer to this idea as the \"Competent Scientist Gambit.\" The core concept is to depict a learning mechanism as powerful as any conceived by empiricists and argue that such a mechanism could not accomplish what a child does. If this can be demonstrated, all empiricist theories would be invalidated. The \"learning mechanism\" Chomsky proposes is a competent, rational scientist.\\n\\nImagine assigning this scientist the task at which a child\\'s mind excels. We provide the scientist with a typical set of primary linguistic data from an actual human language. Her objective is to discover the grammar of that language—the grammar that children exposed to the data will internally represent. In constructing and testing hypotheses about the grammar, the scientist can use any inferential strategy permitted by an empiricist account of the mind. She can record data, conduct sophisticated analyses, devise imaginative or mundane hypotheses, and test them against the available data. Additionally, she can employ the methodological principles and intuitions typically used in empirical theory construction and selection. Simplicity often plays a significant role in these discussions, and we will use \"simplicity\" as a convenient label for the entire package of methodological principles and intuitions available to a competent scientist.\\n\\nHowever, there is one restriction: the competent scientist is not allowed to learn the language from which the primary linguistic data are drawn. There is no reason to believe she couldn\\'t learn the language from the data, as she is a normal human, and we are providing her with data that generally suffices for language learning. The prohibition ensures she does not access data unavailable to the child, such as acquired linguistic intuitions about unpresented sentences, ambiguities, or paraphrases. If her challenge is to replicate what the child does, it would be unfair for her to use information unavailable to the child. It is absurd to suggest that a child must first learn a language to generate the data necessary for learning it.\\n\\nWe assume that after exposure to a decade of primary linguistic data from any natural language, a child successfully constructs a grammar that extends beyond the data and does so correctly, as judged by the senior members of the child\\'s linguistic community. If the scientist is to match the child\\'s achievement, she must also make a monumental projection from the available data and identify the grammar internalized by those producing the data. Chomsky contends that, given only the information in the primary linguistic data and the methodological resources available to her, the competent scientist could not reliably achieve what the child does. That is, the scientist could not discover the grammar the child internally represents when learning a language.\\n\\nIt is crucial to understand Chomsky\\'s claim. He does not deny that the competent scientist could conceive the correct grammar. Of course, she could. By hypothesis, she is intelligent, creative, and resourceful, so if she couldn\\'t think up the right grammar, no one could. However, this intelligence and creativity are also her undoing. Just as she can conceive the correct grammar—the one the child ends up with—she can also conceive an endless variety of incorrect grammars that do not project from the data as the child\\'s grammar does. The key contention of this version of the poverty of the stimulus argument is that the methodological resources available to a scientist will not suffice to motivate the proper selection. Even with criteria like simplicity, the scientist would face an overwhelming number of options. When stating that the scientist would be incapable of \"coming up with\" the right grammar, it means she would have no reliable way to locate the correct grammar among the possible grammars compatible with her limited data.\\n\\nThe Competent Scientist Gambit aims to undermine the empiricist conception of learning. It is plausible to view the competent scientist as a robust and generous characterization of the empiricist mind. If the competent scientist cannot accomplish the task, no learning mechanism compatible with empiricist principles will suffice for language acquisition. If it can be shown that something as resourceful as the empiricist mind would fail at language learning, Chomsky will have demonstrated that the empiricist conception of the mind is flawed.\\n\\nFor this argument to succeed, additional evidence is needed. It must be shown that the methodological principles and biases available to a competent scientist are inadequate for successfully projecting from primary linguistic data to the grammar of the language from which the data are drawn. One way to demonstrate this is to produce a pair of grammars with the following features:\\n1. On all intuitive measures of simplicity, the grammars are comparable.\\n2. The grammars make essentially the same judgments about linguistic phenomena likely to appear in the primary linguistic data.\\n3. The grammars make significantly different judgments about linguistic phenomena unlikely to appear in the primary linguistic data.\\n\\nIf such examples exist, our competent scientist will be unable to choose between the grammars. Since both grammars are compatible with any plausible body of primary linguistic data, she cannot use the data to rule one out. And since they are comparably simple, methodological considerations will not help. If language learners regularly project correctly in these cases, it follows that the mechanisms responsible for language learning must be more powerful than the empiricist conception of the mind allows.\\n\\nIn recent years, linguistics has focused on compiling examples of this nature. For instance, Hornstein and Lightfoot present a case where the choice between two very different, though comparably simple, grammars hinges on paraphrase relations among sentences like:\\n\\n1. She told me three funny stories, but I didn\\'t like the one about Max.\\n2. She told me three funny stories, but I didn\\'t like the story about Max.\\n3. She told me three funny stories, but I didn\\'t like the funny story about Max.\\n\\nIn one grammar, (2) is considered a paraphrase of (1), but (3) is not. The other grammar correctly entails that both (2) and (3) might be paraphrases of (1). Hornstein and Lightfoot argue that it is unlikely every child learning English is exposed to primary linguistic data containing evidence about these abstruse paraphrase facts. If this is correct, and if the only evidence distinguishing the two grammars is comparably abstruse, our competent scientist is in trouble. She can conceive both grammars, and since neither is simpler or superior on other methodological grounds, such considerations will not aid her in making the correct choice. Unlike real linguists who worried about choosing between these grammars, she lacks the data to make the right choice.\\n\\nThe argument is contingent on linguistic facts. For it to be persuasive, there must be numerous examples where the choice between two equally simple and natural grammars can only be made by appealing to abstruse evidence unlikely to be found in primary linguistic data. A substantial collection of plausible cases exists in the literature. If these cases withstand critical scrutiny, Chomsky and his followers will have made significant progress in their case against empiricism.\\n\\nThis leads us to the conclusion of the second version of the poverty of the stimulus argument, a doctrine we will call anti-empiricism. This doctrine asserts not only that the innate language learning mechanism must have strong biases but also that these biases are incompatible with the mental mechanisms suggested by even a generous characterization of the empiricist mind. Anti-empiricism makes a negative claim about the language learning mechanism—a claim about what its biases are not. The third version of the poverty of stimulus argument aims to establish a positive claim about how the language learning mechanism functions.',\n"," '**2.3. The Case for Rationalism**\\n\\nIf the empiricist view of the mind falls short in explaining language acquisition, what alternative models can? To address this, we should consider why our hypothetical scientist struggles to replicate a child\\'s language learning. The issue isn\\'t her inability to conceive the correct grammar; rather, it\\'s her capacity to generate numerous incorrect grammars that are equally simple and compatible with the data, without a method to distinguish among them. To overcome this, one strategy might be to limit the range of grammars she needs to evaluate. Imagine if all correct human language grammars—those actually represented in speakers\\' minds—shared certain characteristics. If informed of these properties from the start, the scientist\\'s task would be significantly simplified, as she could disregard any grammars lacking these \\'universal\\' features. The more extensive the collection of universal features, the stronger the constraints on the grammars she must consider, thereby easing her task.\\n\\nWhat does this imply about a child\\'s mind? The logical hypothesis drawn from comparing the child\\'s task to the scientist\\'s is that a child\\'s mind is equipped with knowledge of linguistic universals—biases specific to language acquisition—that help identify the correct grammar by narrowing the search space. According to this hypothesis, a child starts with a substantial amount of innate linguistic information that defines the class of all human languages. The relatively limited environmental input is seen merely as a trigger; much of the eventual linguistic ability is determined by genetically encoded principles, activated rather than directly formed by environmental stimuli.\\n\\nThis hypothesis extends beyond the notion that the innate language learning mechanism\\'s biases are non-empiricist. As John Searle points out, \"Chomsky argues not just that the child must have \\'learning readiness\\', \\'biases\\', and \\'dispositions\\', but that he must possess a specific set of linguistic mechanisms.\" Furthermore, the domain specificity of innate mechanisms has traditionally been a feature of rationalist views of the mind. For Chomsky and his followers, the primary argument for the child\\'s domain-specific language learning biases is an inference to the best explanation—it is \"the only substantive proposal to address the problem of acquiring language knowledge.\" Before the rise of connectionism, Chomsky\\'s argument was quite compelling. Considering the challenges a child faces, it is difficult to imagine how they could solve the projection problem and arrive at the correct grammar without a rich set of constraints specifically designed for the task. The conclusion that the innate language learning mechanism includes such constraints is derived from the third version of the poverty of the stimulus argument, which we will refer to as rationalism.\\n\\nWe have now completed our reconstruction of the three versions of the poverty of the stimulus argument and the conclusions drawn from them. In Section 4, we will examine how connectionism might challenge these arguments. Before that, however, we will provide a brief overview of connectionism and review some recent efforts to study linguistic phenomena within a connectionist framework.',\n"," '# 3. An Overview of Connectionist Research on Language\\n\\nConnectionism represents a novel approach to cognitive modeling that has gained prominence over the past decade. Connectionist models are composed of networks made up of numerous simple, interacting units. These units, inspired by neuronal architecture, are typically interconnected in a manner that allows them to either excite or inhibit each other by transmitting activation signals through pathways. These networks often include an input layer, an output layer, and one or more intermediate (\\'hidden\\') layers, all linked by weighted connections that facilitate the flow of activation. In \\'feed-forward\\' networks, processing occurs in a single direction, with units modifying and passing activation signals to subsequent units and layers. More complex networks may feature feedback loops and bidirectional communication between nodes, forming what are known as \\'recurrent\\' networks. Units may have threshold values that their total input must surpass for activation, or they may function analogously, with activation values ranging from 0 to 100%. The connections between units have varying weights, determining the strength and excitatory or inhibitory nature of the activation signal transferred from one unit to another.\\n\\nThis architecture supports a computational style distinct from earlier cognitive models, which primarily relied on \\'symbol manipulations\\'. In traditional models, information is stored in separate locations from the structures performing computational operations, and processing involves manipulating discrete tokens or symbols according to encoded rules or commands.\\n\\nConnectionist information processing differs significantly from these earlier models. Notably, it typically does not involve manipulating distinct symbolic tokens. While connectionist modelers may use the concept of representations to describe network elements, these representations differ from the discrete symbolic entities found in classical architectures. This is particularly true in models employing \\'distributed representations\\', where the same set of units and weights encode diverse information. Another key difference is that connectionist models blur the line between structures that store information and those that process it. Information is \\'stored\\' in the connection weights between units, which also play a central role in processing. Thus, traditional notions of stored programs or autonomous command structures are absent in connectionist architecture.\\n\\nThese differences are significant in the debate over the psychological reality of linguistic rules. As discussed in Section 2.1, Chomsky\\'s poverty of the stimulus arguments assume that language learning results in an internally represented generative grammar, typically a set of rewrite or production rules composed of distinct symbols. Pre-connectionist cognitive models, which view cognition as symbol manipulation, align with this view. However, connectionist models, especially those with distributed representations and non-modular strategies, struggle to accommodate the symbolic rules posited by generative grammarians. Chomsky argued that internalized grammatical rules were the best explanation for linguistic judgments and behavior, and prior to connectionism, this argument was compelling. If connectionist models can account for similar linguistic data, Chomsky\\'s claim that internalized rule explanations are the \"only game in town\" may no longer hold.\\n\\nConnectionist information processing is governed by connection weights between units, allowing computations to be altered by changing these weights. Researchers realized that purposeful weight changes could enable models to learn in a biologically plausible and computationally revolutionary manner. Recent advancements have addressed past challenges in multi-layer weight adjustment, leading to powerful learning strategies that allow connectionist networks to effectively \\'program\\' themselves. The \\'generalized delta rule\\' or \\'backpropagation\\', developed by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, is a widely used learning algorithm. During training, a network is presented with inputs and produces outputs, which are compared to target outputs to generate an error signal. This signal is propagated back through the network, adjusting weights according to the learning algorithm. Once trained, the system can make informed responses to new inputs not encountered during training. The success of models is often measured by their ability to generalize within a specific task domain.\\n\\nThis overview highlights the basic elements of the connectionist paradigm. We now turn to the growing body of research focused on developing models of language processing and acquisition. Much of this research is driven by skepticism about Chomsky\\'s account of language acquisition and the belief that connectionist architectures may offer more natural explanations. Before connectionism, Chomsky argued that it was difficult to refine or elaborate on empiricist ideas about conditioning and associative nets to account for linguistic competence. Many connectionists believe their computational tools address these challenges and have developed impressive models to demonstrate this point.\\n\\nA typical model is PARSNIP, developed by Hanson and Kegl. This auto-associator network was trained on three sets of syntactically tagged natural language sentences. Assuming that natural language reveals linguistic constraints that limit possible grammars, the modelers found that a network trained to produce accurate copies of input could also exhibit grammar-like behavior in various linguistic tasks. The network learned to produce correct syntactic category labels for each sentence position and generalized to 1,000 new sentences distinct from the training samples. PARSNIP performs sentence completion and recognizes novel sentence patterns absent from the presented corpus. Notably, PARSNIP reproduces test sentences with deep center-embedded patterns it has never seen while failing with multiply center-embedded patterns.\\n\\nHanson and Kegl acknowledge that their model has psychologically implausible features, such as insensitivity to temporal factors, but argue that:\\n\\n> There are important parallels between the task given to PARSNIP and the task that arises for children as they learn a natural language. Both PARSNIP and the child are only exposed to sentences from natural language, and both must induce general rules and larger constituents from the regularities they encounter, based solely on positive evidence. PARSNIP\\'s ability to generalize knowledge of constituent structure has been extracted from its experience with natural language sentences.\\n\\nSeveral connectionist models aim to account for language aspects that are challenging for conventional rule-based systems. Sensitivity to multiple information sources, such as phonetic, semantic, and contextual cues, is easier to implement in connectionist networks with distributed encodings and parallel processing. McClelland and Kawamoto (1986) designed a system to assign correct case roles to sentence constituents, using word order and semantic constraints to determine case assignments and select contextually appropriate readings of ambiguous words. A similar but more complex model by St. John and McClelland (1988) learns mappings between words in specific contexts and concepts, predicting additional meanings implicit in sentences.\\n\\nWhile these systems focus on semantic aspects of language comprehension, other connectionist models address syntactic, phonological, and non-semantic components of language processing. For example, Fanty (1985) developed a connectionist parser that incorporates all levels of the parse tree simultaneously, producing the sentence\\'s surface structure as output. Other connectionist parsing efforts include models by Cottrell (1985), Waltz and Pollack (1985), Selman and Hirst (1985), and Charniak and Santos (1986). Rumelhart and McClelland (1986b) created a network to model the acquisition of English past-tense verbs, replicating human past tense learning aspects like overgeneralization of regular forms to irregular forms without discrete symbolic rules. Elman (1988) developed a model that learns to segment an unbroken input stream into phonemes, morphemes, and words, a capacity often considered innate. The model also produced lexical class representations through exposure to word order alone, distinguishing nouns and verbs and organizing their representations into semantic hierarchies.\\n\\nThis survey, though not exhaustive, demonstrates that connectionist language modeling is a robust and thriving research area. While it is too early to determine the ultimate success of this work, our focus is not on debating the superiority of connectionist models but on exploring how nativism arguments will fare if connectionist models prove empirically accurate in explaining language acquisition and linguistic competence. This is the issue we will address in the following section.',\n"," '**4.2. The Second Connectionist Challenge: Connectionist Learning Algorithms and Language Acquisition**\\n\\nThe poverty of the stimulus argument, in all its forms, concludes that the mechanism responsible for language acquisition must inherently favor certain outcomes over others. The anti-empiricist perspective argues that these biases are incompatible with the empiricist view of the mind. Meanwhile, the rationalist perspective suggests that these biases are specific to language and only relevant to language acquisition. However, consider the possibility that a system utilizing backpropagation or another connectionist learning algorithm could effectively model a significant aspect of a child\\'s language learning process. For instance, imagine a connectionist model that can replicate a language learner\\'s ability to extrapolate from primary linguistic data to make judgments about sentences they have never encountered. This hypothetical model, when exposed to a sample of primary linguistic data from any natural language (a large set of utterances similar to those a child might hear, possibly with contextual information), could learn to differentiate between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences with accuracy comparable to a human learner.\\n\\nThe existence of such a model could potentially challenge all three versions of nativism. It could be argued that backpropagation and other connectionist learning algorithms are not limited to language but are broadly applicable across various domains. Backpropagation has been successfully used in training networks for diverse tasks, from converting written text into phonemes to distinguishing sonar echoes of rocks from those of undersea mines. Thus, the imagined learning model directly challenges the rationalist doctrine. Furthermore, connectionist learning algorithms like backpropagation align with the simple, general-purpose learning mechanisms envisioned by the empiricist tradition. Historically, backpropagation can be seen as a variant of a simple learning rule proposed by Hebb, and the unmodified \\'delta rule\\' was first introduced by Sutton and Barto as part of their classical conditioning theory. Therefore, if such a connectionist acquisition model could be developed, it would challenge the anti-empiricist doctrine. It might even threaten minimal nativism, as backpropagation and other connectionist learning algorithms appear to be largely unbiased. This may be what Sampson refers to when he states: \"The knowledge eventually stored in the system, in the pattern of weights, is derived entirely from the input. The system\\'s only contribution is to react in a passive, mechanical way to individual data items.\"\\n\\nThese challenges suggest that connectionism is on a potential collision course with Chomsky\\'s nativism. If empirically successful connectionist models of adult linguistic competence can be developed, a key assumption of the poverty of the stimulus arguments will be undermined. Additionally, if connectionist learning algorithms can extrapolate from primary linguistic data as children do, the conclusions of all three arguments are at risk. However, even if connectionism succeeds, the challenge it poses to Chomskian nativism may not be devastating. While the connectionist achievements we envision could disrupt all three versions of the poverty of the stimulus argument, this alone would not refute Chomsky\\'s nativist conclusions. As we will explore in the following section, a new version of the argument for minimal nativism can be formulated to bypass both connectionist challenges. The argument for anti-empiricism can also be reconstructed, as discussed in Section 4.4, though it will require a different type of empirical evidence than that used in Section 2.2. Furthermore, as we will argue in Section 4.5, even Chomskian rationalism may ultimately be compatible with our hypothesized connectionist achievements.',\n"," \"**4.3. Connectionism and Minimal Nativism**\\n\\nFor the sake of argument, let's assume that, contrary to Chomsky's claims, the mechanisms supporting a speaker's linguistic abilities do not rely on an internally represented grammar. Instead, let's propose that a trained connectionist network underlies a speaker's ability to judge sentences as grammatical or ungrammatical. Under this assumption, the role of the language acquisition mechanism is to develop an appropriate network that evaluates sentences in the same way as other speakers of the language. The input available to this mechanism consists of a typically disorganized collection of primary linguistic data, primarily from the language being learned. Naturally, the network produced by the acquisition mechanism must be able to respond correctly to a wide range of sentences that it has never encountered before.\\n\\nJust as there are countless grammars that are equally compatible with any given set of primary linguistic data—despite differing in their judgments about sentences not included in that data—there are also countless connectionist networks that agree, to a large extent, on their judgments about a given set of primary linguistic data, while differing in their judgments about sentences not included in the data. Therefore, the language acquisition mechanism must somehow eliminate a vast number of networks that are equally compatible with the data. To achieve this, the mechanism must be strongly biased towards acquiring certain networks and against others. This is precisely what minimal nativism asserts. This conclusion is independent of any assumptions we might make about the algorithm used by the acquisition mechanism. If a connectionist acquisition mechanism using backpropagation can indeed produce a trained network that makes accurate judgments about numerous sentences not included in the primary linguistic data, the conclusion is not that minimal nativism is incorrect, but rather that the learning algorithm is strongly biased towards certain projections and against others. This should not be surprising. The task of the language acquisition mechanism is an inductive learning task. As Goodman and others demonstrated long ago, any successful inductive learning strategy must be strongly biased.\",\n"," \"### 4.4. Connectionism and Anti-Empiricism\\n\\nMinimal nativism suggests that the language learning mechanism must have inherent biases. In contrast, the Chomskian argument for anti-empiricism posits that simplicity and other methodological principles, which scientists might use to choose among theories, are insufficient to explain a child's success in language acquisition. As discussed in Section 2.2, the anti-empiricist argument requires sophisticated linguistic evidence. It involves identifying cases where two grammars, nearly equal in simplicity and other methodological virtues, also agree on typical primary linguistic data. If these grammars differ in their judgments about cases unlikely to be found in primary linguistic data, a competent scientist attempting to replicate a child's achievement would struggle to choose between them.\\n\\nThis argument for anti-empiricism assumes that the mechanism underlying linguistic competence is a grammar, based on specific claims about the formal properties of grammars. However, as noted in Section 4.1, the success of connectionism challenges this assumption. Connectionist models of competence do not rely on grammar; thus, the compatibility of different grammars with data and their simplicity would not support anti-empiricism if connectionist models prove accurate. Therefore, the connectionist models of linguistic competence we envision undermine the standard Chomskian argument for anti-empiricism. This does not refute anti-empiricism, as it is possible to reconstruct an anti-empiricist argument parallel to Chomsky's, assuming linguistic competence is supported by a connectionist network.\\n\\nAssuming adult linguistic competence is supported by a connectionist network rather than a grammar, we must identify cases where two connectionist networks exhibit the following properties:\\n1. The networks make similar judgments about sentences likely to appear in primary linguistic data.\\n2. The networks make significantly different judgments about sentences unlikely to appear in primary linguistic data.\\n3. The networks are similar in terms of intuitive simplicity and other methodological criteria.\\n\\nGiven the recent emergence of connectionist studies of language and skepticism about nativism among many researchers, there has been no systematic effort to find such examples. Consequently, the data needed to support our reconstructed anti-nativist argument are unavailable. However, there is no a priori reason to believe that the required evidence cannot be found. In assessing the threat connectionism poses to anti-empiricism, this point is crucial. It suggests that even if the assumptions in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are correct, the truth of anti-empiricism remains an open question, to be resolved through further empirical research. If the appropriate linguistic evidence is found and the language acquisition mechanism is indeed a connectionist device using back propagation, the conclusion is not that anti-empiricism is incorrect, but that the connectionist acquisition mechanism embodies biases different from those in the empiricist tradition. Specifically, if the data are correct, the connectionist acquisition mechanism must use something other than simplicity and other intuitive methodological principles. For, by hypothesis, the acquisition mechanism prefers one network over another, even though they are comparably simple and equally compatible with the data. Conversely, if the appropriate linguistic examples are not found, we have no reason to consider anti-empiricism true.\\n\\nBefore concluding the discussion on anti-empiricism, one final point requires attention. As noted in Section 4.2, back propagation, the most widely used connectionist learning algorithm, was inspired by Hebbian learning rules and classical conditioning. While back propagation is more sophisticated than Hebb's rule or the unmodified delta rule used in classical conditioning, it shares a strong resemblance with them. It could be argued that Hebb's rule and classical conditioning processes align with the mental processes posited in the empiricist tradition. Therefore, if a connectionist language acquisition device using back propagation can project from data as a child does, why not conclude that an empiricist acquisition device could succeed in learning language?\\n\\nThe issue here is how to best understand the notion of an 'empiricist' learning mechanism. Chomsky and his followers have used the competent scientist approach as the definitive test for empiricism. Any acquisition mechanism that can reliably perform tasks a competent scientist cannot is not considered an empiricist mechanism. By this standard, connectionist devices using back propagation may not be empiricist mechanisms. An alternative account of an 'empiricist' learning mechanism rejects the competent scientist standard, with its reliance on intuitive simplicity and other methodological considerations, opting instead for a family resemblance criterion. By this account, connectionist devices using back propagation likely are empiricist mechanisms. This dispute is largely semantic. It will be interesting and important if the competent scientist account of empiricism and the family resemblance account do not align. However, if this occurs, who retains the term 'empiricist' is of little consequence.\",\n"," '**4.5. Connectionism and Rationalism**\\n\\nRationalism, as we have been discussing, posits that the innate language learning mechanism includes biases or constraints specifically tailored for language acquisition, which are not applicable to other domains. The Chomskian defense of this thesis hinges on the assertion that no viable alternatives exist. In 1980, prior to the rise of connectionism, Wexler and Culicover stated:\\n\\n\"Currently, the constraints we require are distinctly linguistic. While more general theories would be fascinating, as insightful generalizations always are, we must remain skeptical until we have reason to believe in these generalizations or can coherently formulate them.\"\\n\\nHowever, the advancements in connectionism challenge the Chomskian argument. As noted, connectionist learning algorithms are not exclusively linguistic; they have been successfully applied across various domains. Therefore, if a connectionist acquisition device could extrapolate from primary linguistic data as a child does, Chomskians can no longer assert that rationalist acquisition models are the sole option.\\n\\nDisproving Chomsky\\'s argument for rationalism does not necessarily invalidate rationalism itself, nor does it prove that connectionism is incompatible with rationalism. There are numerous connectionist learning devices that utilize backpropagation. Some require unique architectures or extensive pre-wiring and pre-tuning to perform adequately in their designated task domains. As McClelland and Rumelhart observe, such models align with a strongly nativist perspective. While connectionist research has developed learning strategies that are not domain-specific, the extent to which these strategies can succeed in language acquisition without relying on specialized architectures remains uncertain. If successful connectionist language acquisition devices necessitate language-specific architectures or pre-tuning, then even the rationalist version of nativism remains unthreatened by connectionism. Recently, Rumelhart and others have been investigating ways to modify connectionist learning algorithms to bias learning in specific directions. If the most effective connectionist models for language acquisition employ a learning algorithm particularly suited for language learning and largely ineffective in other domains, then rationalism and connectionism could be harmoniously compatible.\\n\\nIt is also possible that connectionist learning models might replicate significant aspects of language learning without relying on unique architectures, specialized pre-tuning, or domain-specific learning algorithms, and that similar models could excel in cognitive tasks in domains unrelated to language. If such non-domain-specific models were developed, they would present a genuine challenge to Chomskian rationalism.',\n"," '# Commonsense Refutations of Eliminativism\\n\\nLike William Lycan, I also believe that eliminative materialism, in any of its primary forms, is a false doctrine. However, I am skeptical that it can be directly refuted in a Moorean manner, as Lycan suggests. Here are the reasons for my skepticism:\\n\\n1. Eliminativism regarding propositional attitudes is, in Lycan\\'s words, \"materialism plus the claim that no creature has ever had a belief, desire, intention, hope, wish, or the like.\" This surprising doctrine, supported by Churchland (1981), Stich (1983), and others as a plausible conjecture, is purportedly established by its proponents through various arguments, such as those Lycan enumerates (El-E6). Lycan argues that this doctrine is refuted by the fact that many commonsense mental ascriptions, like \"Granny wants a beer and believes there is one under the sofa,\" are \"individually more plausible... than are the purely philosophical premises of any arguments designed to convince us to the contrary.\" According to him, the conclusion of eliminativist arguments implies that commonsense ascriptions are never true, and thus, the falsity of eliminativism is directly entailed by something he knows to be true (that his Granny wants beer), just as the falsity of McTaggart\\'s claim that time is unreal is \"directly entailed\" by something Moore knew to be true (that he had breakfast before lunch).\\n\\nI agree with Lycan that statements like \"S wants x\" or \"S believes that p\" have stronger epistemic credentials and are more likely to be true (and known to be true) than any purely philosophical proposition. However, I doubt that the truth of such Moorean commonsensical statements directly entails the falsity of eliminativism, the philosophical doctrine that there are no beliefs, desires, and the like. Let me explain by presenting an ad hominem argument.\\n\\nStephen Stich, possibly the most clearheaded among the eliminativists, once said: \"A question I have often encountered... is whether I think there are any such things as beliefs. But the question is less than clear. If it means: Are statements of the form \\'S believes that p\\' or \\'x is the belief that p\\' ever true, the answer is plainly yes.... However, if the question is construed as asking whether there are belief state tokens or belief state types (i.e., properties), then the answer is negative\" (Stich 1983, p. 226). Here is a champion of eliminativism who, at least in one of his moods, has no problem allowing that commonsense belief ascriptions are often \"plainly true,\" but who is not prepared to accept (indeed, explicitly denies) what on Lycan\\'s Moorean account they \"directly entail\"—namely, the thesis that there are such things as beliefs. How can Stich have it both ways? How can he claim both that commonsense belief ascriptions are often plainly true, and that nonetheless there are no belief states or properties? The answer, I think, is as follows.\\n\\nThe thesis that there are (or are not) such things as beliefs, desires, and so on is a philosophical thesis, and like most philosophical theses, it does not wear its meaning on its sleeve. Until we are told what kinds of things beliefs are supposed to be, it is \"less than clear,\" as Stich puts it, what we are asking when we ask whether there are any such things as beliefs. The point is that eliminativism, in any of its forms, is a philosophical thesis whose precise content is to be determined not by direct confrontation with commonsense statements, but only vis-à-vis some other philosophical thesis that tells us something about the nature of beliefs and desires, whose existence it affirms. As Lycan himself makes clear, the thesis that various forms of eliminativism oppose is folk psychology under the so-called \"theory\" theory interpretation; and that, by my lights, is some form or other of intentional realism—the thesis that there are inner states (types and tokens) that meet some such conditions as having determinate content (whether broad or narrow), as having causal efficacy, as having (perhaps) combinatorial structure, and the like. As the various standard arguments for eliminativism make plain, the conclusion they aim to establish is that there are no states or properties that satisfy all or any of these conditions, and depending on which conditions are claimed not to be satisfied, there are distinct brands or grades of eliminativism (including subtle blends of eliminativism and epiphenomenalism, as E4 types of arguments, in Lycan\\'s listing, make plain).\\n\\nSo it is unsurprising that Stich should conclude: \"In denying that believing that p is a property [a state type], we need not deny that statements of the form \\'x is a belief that p\\' are often unproblematically true\" (1983, p. 226). For, he explains, \"it is simply a mistake to assume that every meaningful predicate or open sentence corresponds to or expresses a property\" (p. 225). The point is that while for Stich (at least in one of his moods) a sentence of the form \"S believes that p\" may be unproblematically true, its truth conditions are not unproblematic, or at any rate they are not what intentional realism takes them to be.\\n\\nStich holds that ascriptions of the form \"S believes that p\" are true just in case S is in a state similar to the state that would underlie our ordinary utterance of p. But for Stich, there is no unique such state that all believers that p share; and so there is no belief property corresponding to \"S believes that p\"—certainly no belief property of the sort intentional realism claims there is. But still, Stich argues, different people may each be in some state or other that resembles, by diverse and even conflicting similarity measures, the state that would underlie our ordinary utterance of p; and, depending on a number of contextual considerations, people in one or another of these states may sometimes merit a true ascription of the belief predicate. I do not believe Stich\\'s story for a moment; but my aim here is not to defend or refute eliminativism (Stich\\'s or anyone\\'s), but to illustrate how much more tortuous the route is from the acceptance of Moorean commonsense statements to the rejection of a philosophical thesis such as eliminative materialism, than Lycan makes it out to be.\\n\\n2. Lycan might reasonably protest that I have represented Stich\\'s position in one of his less-than-clearly eliminativist moods (for Stichean scholars, that is the \"modified Panglossian\" mood; cf. Stich, 1983, chapter 5). Recall that on Stich\\'s \"Syntactic Theory of the Mind\" (STM), the scientifically relevant—the \"real\" mental states are syntactic computational states, which (unlike folk psychological states) have no content essentially. Now as long as the STM theory, in Stich\\'s words, \"cleaves reasonably close to the pattern presupposed by folk psychology,\" (p. 229) belief ascriptions can often be regarded as true, even though the states ascribed are not the belief states of folk theory but, rather, syntactic belief-like states (belief-like because they resemble folk-psychological beliefs in regard to their \"causal profile\" or functional role). If it should turn out (and for Stich, this is a \"real possibility,\" p. 229) that the functional architecture of the mind is significantly different from that presupposed by folk psychology, then belief ascriptions would no longer be unproblematically true (in Stich\\'s words: \"We could no longer say that belief sentences stand a good shot at being true\"; 1983, p. 229). In that eventuality, there will be nothing—no belief or belief-like state—to which the predicate \"is a belief that p\" applies. I am much more skeptical than Stich that such a scenario will ever materialize, but I believe, with Stich, that it is a strictly empirical question whether it will or not: It is not a question to be decided a priori, by means of a Moorean argument.\\n\\nThis brings me to my second main point. As Lycan acknowledges, Moorean common-sense beliefs are not irrefutable. They can be refuted by scientific theorizing. The belief that the earth is flat and motionless was refuted by science, as was the belief that granite boulders are (literally) solid. So why is it exactly that our commonsense belief in the existence of such states as beliefs and desires is not open to an analogous sort of refutation by what may turn out to be our best scientific psychology? Lycan\\'s answer is: \"In order to reach the staggering conclusion that there has never been a belief, a desire, or any other propositional attitude, any argument for eliminativism will have to rest on one or more a priori principles connecting scientific truths to negative ontology. It is terminally unlikely that any such principle could be more credible for me than that Granny wants beer.\"\\n\\nI suspect that the same is true of any commonsense empirical belief that stands to be refuted by scientific evidence. Scientific evidence by itself refutes nothing: One needs a complex inductive (or abductive) argument that relates evidence to theory, that confronts the proposed theory with competing theories, and that with the help of several assumptions (methodological, epistemological, and even metaphysical) chooses one theory over competing theories and thus \"refutes\" the targeted belief. I doubt that there is any real disanalogy between the style of argumentation that would refute our belief in folk psychological beliefs and the style of argumentation that would refute any other commonsensical belief. Eliminativist arguments that appeal to a (future) cognitive psychology to refute our belief in the propositional attitudes will be no more dependent on principles that \"connect scientific truths to negative ontology\" than are arguments that appeal to basic physics to refute our common-sense belief that the granite boulder is solid through and through.\\n\\nIn the end, Lycan, I think, comes to much the same conclusion about the refutability of folk psychology by science. Chemistry and physics, he says, have shown us that the boulder is not solid after all. Yet in some \"operational sense,\" the boulder is solid: It is impenetrable, hard, and so on. Perhaps—he goes on to say—\"science will force us to distinguish a fairly superficial, operational sense of \\'believe\\' and the rest from a more commissive sense.\" This \"halfway house\" for beliefs does not sound unlike Stich\\'s first (\"modified Panglossian\") proposal that I described earlier: There really are no beliefs; but belief ascriptions are sometimes \"plainly true.\" Indeed, depending on what the \"operational\" and the \"commissive\" senses exactly come to, even the more virulent Stich (and, to a degree, even Churchland, let alone such an exemplary halfway-house resident as Dennett, 1981) may feel vindicated.\\n\\n3. I would like to conclude with a metaphilosophical point. Suppose that the Moorean argument were valid, and that we thereby had all the \"epistemic warrant\" we need to claim that there are such things as beliefs, and even that they have just the properties attributed to them by folk theory. Still, the really interesting and fundamental question remains: How is it possible for beliefs, so conceived, to exist—that is, to have the properties ascribed to them by folk theory? As Kant taught us, it is the question of how, not the question of whether, that is often the more philosophically interesting. Interesting philosophical theorizing, like all theorizing, often has a transcendental character: Granted that such and such is the case (that scientific knowledge is possible, that we are free agents, that our thoughts are causally efficacious, or whatever), how is it possible for this to be the case, given certain other (independently plausible but prima facie conflicting) beliefs, philosophical assumptions, and scientific commitments? The aim of this sort of transcendental theorizing is not to establish the truth of a belief (for which we may already have adequate warrant), but to accommodate the belief within a web of other beliefs. So granted (as Lycan and I cheerfully grant) that there are propositional attitudes folk theoretically conceived, how is it possible for them to have determinate intentional content, to be causally efficacious and be so in virtue of their content, and so on, given certain widely accepted assumptions about externalism, holism, the closure of the physical domain, supervenience, the principle of causal/explanatory exclusion, and so on? Many eliminativist (and epiphenomenalist) arguments have forced us to think about just these kinds of questions. A Moorean type of refutation of eliminativism need not, of course, blind us to these questions, but may just invite a certain complacency in thinking that our folk-psychological beliefs are not only true but unproblematically true. If that happened, it would be a pity.',\n"," '\\\\section*{What Does It Take to Be a True Believer? Critiquing the Opulent Ideology of Eliminative Materialism}\\n\\nEliminative materialism, as William Lycan discusses in this volume, is a form of materialism that asserts no creature has ever experienced beliefs, desires, intentions, hopes, wishes, or other \"folk psychological\" states. Some contemporary philosophers argue that eliminative materialism is likely true. They propose potential scenarios for the development of cognitive science and neuroscience, suggesting that if these scenarios were accurate, eliminative materialism would be validated.\\n\\nBroadly, there are two ways to counter the claim that eliminative materialism is true (or highly probable). One approach is to argue that the scenarios envisioned by eliminativists are extremely unlikely. Based on current knowledge, including unbiased scientific understanding, we can be confident that these scenarios will not occur. The other approach is to argue that even if these scenarios did occur, they would not undermine commonsense psychology. People would still possess beliefs, desires, and other folk psychological states.\\n\\nThese two strategies are not mutually exclusive; one could employ both. However, the second strategy challenges eliminativism at a more fundamental level. If successful, it would secure the position of folk psychology, demonstrating that it is not vulnerable to the potential empirical-theoretical developments envisioned by eliminativists. The likelihood of such scenarios occurring would not affect the integrity of folk psychology.\\n\\nEliminativist arguments often rely, sometimes implicitly, on certain assumptions about what it takes for a creature to have beliefs, desires, and other folk psychological states—assumptions about some supposed necessary conditions for being a \"true believer\" (a term borrowed from Dennett, 1987b). With these assumptions, the eliminativist envisions a scenario where the supposed necessary condition is unmet. Since this scenario could potentially occur, they argue, eliminativism is likely true.\\n\\nTo pursue the second strategy against eliminativist arguments is to argue that the assumptions about necessary conditions for true believerhood in eliminativist arguments are likely false. We advocate for this second strategy. We believe Lycan also supports this generic strategy and presents his own argument to implement it—his \"particularly compelling\" Moorean argument. However, our approach to implementing this strategy differs significantly from Lycan\\'s. In this chapter, we will present our own anti-eliminativist argument, highlighting the differences between our approach and Lycan\\'s.',\n"," '# What Eliminativist Arguments Need to Assume\\n\\nTo illustrate our points, let\\'s examine a common eliminativist argument, though the key insights will apply broadly. Eliminativists often posit that possessing a \"language of thought\" (LT)—a system of internal mental representations with languagelike syntactic structure and propositional content—is a necessary condition for being a true believer. They argue that mature cognitive science might not support the existence of an LT, leading to the conclusion that humans may not be true believers.\\n\\nThe question arises: In what sense must eliminativists claim that possessing an LT is necessary for being a true believer? We must distinguish between two notions of necessary conditions. First, a conceptually grounded necessary condition is one embedded in the very concept of belief or a true believer (a being with beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.). Second, a de facto necessary condition is a scientific prerequisite for having beliefs and being a true believer.\\n\\nWith this distinction, we can refine the question: Is it sufficient for eliminativists to claim that possessing an LT is merely a de facto necessary condition, or must they assert that it is a conceptually grounded necessary condition for true believerhood?\\n\\nTo explore this, consider two advocates of the LT hypothesis, Zenon and Jerry. Zenon believes that a conceptually grounded necessary condition for being a true believer is susceptibility to a \"robust folk psychological interpretation\"—a coherent assignment of beliefs and desires that aligns with folk psychology and explains a wide range of behaviors. True believers must exhibit \"true-believer-indicating\" (TBI) capacities, or have internal states that would support such capacities if not for physical limitations.\\n\\nZenon also holds that beliefs must be realized by autonomous internal states. Thus, humanoid robots controlled by external forces, despite behaving like humans, would not be true believers. He believes that satisfying these conditions is a conceptually grounded sufficient condition for true believerhood, and there is strong evidence that humans meet these criteria. He argues that human behavior is the result of autonomous inner states, not external control, and that folk psychological states are realized by cognitive science-described states, which involve cognitive \"functional architecture\" or \"psychotectonic realization.\"\\n\\nZenon asserts that there is strong evidence, including from cognitive science, that these psychotectonic states involve languagelike mental representations in an LT cognitive architecture. He claims that, scientifically, the only way beliefs could be realized in beings like humans is through an LT cognitive architecture, making it a de facto necessary condition for true believerhood.\\n\\nFor Zenon, the LT hypothesis is not part of the concept of belief. He argues that possessing an LT is a de facto necessary condition, not a conceptually grounded one.\\n\\nIn contrast, Jerry believes that possessing an LT is a conceptually grounded necessary condition for true believerhood, embedded in the concept of belief itself. He agrees with Zenon that cognitive science will posit an LT architecture and that beliefs are realized in humans by states in this architecture. He also contends that no non-LT architecture could support TBI capacities.\\n\\nBoth Zenon and Jerry would challenge the eliminativist\\'s premise that cognitive science might not posit an LT. However, they differ on the subjunctive claim:\\n\\n(S) If we were to obtain good evidence that humans do not possess an LT, we would then have good evidence that humans are not true believers.\\n\\nFor Zenon, this claim is false. Even without an LT, he argues, humans would still meet all conceptually grounded necessary conditions for true believerhood. The evidence would suggest that beliefs are realized differently, not that humans aren\\'t true believers. For Jerry, however, the claim is true because an LT is a conceptually grounded necessary condition.\\n\\nThis parable highlights two key points for eliminativists regarding the LT hypothesis and folk psychology. First, claiming that an LT is a de facto necessary condition is insufficient. Eliminativists must argue that even without evidence of an LT, it remains a prerequisite for true believerhood. Second, eliminativists must assert, like Jerry, that having an LT is a conceptually grounded necessary condition. Without this, evidence against an LT would not necessarily support eliminativism.\\n\\nFinally, the eliminativist argument does not presuppose a distinction between analytic and nonanalytic truths, nor does it require that LT possession is a purely conceptually grounded truth. Conceptually grounded truths might include empirical claims, as long as these claims remain highly warranted even without evidence of an LT. For example:\\n\\nGiven that beliefs are realized by physicochemical processes, a creature can have beliefs only if it has an LT.\\n\\nMoreover, the relevant conceptually grounded truths need not be knowable a priori, as epistemic status differs from semantic/modal status. This leads us to our next section.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Philosophy and Ideological Inquiry}\\n\\nWe define \"ideology\" as the exploration of human concepts and the semantics of the terms that express these concepts, as well as the facts that such exploration aims to uncover (cf. Horgan, 1993; Graham and Horgan, 1994; Henderson and Horgan, 2000). Ideology, as a field of inquiry, is a broadly empirical and interdisciplinary endeavor that includes psychology, linguistics, social anthropology, and philosophy. We argue that even the philosophical aspect of ideology is empirical, rather than a priori in the traditional sense. The data philosophers use are readily accessible, including, but not limited to, one\\'s own conceptual and linguistic intuitions about how to describe various concrete scenarios, whether actual or hypothetical. Philosophical thought experiments are genuine experiments: they produce empirical data in the form of these intuitions. Such data provide strong, though potentially fallible, empirical evidence regarding questions of ideology because, all else being equal, the relevant intuitive judgments are likely to reflect one\\'s own conceptual and semantic competence.\\n\\nTo understand that the type of ideological inquiry typically conducted in philosophy is indeed a broadly empirical endeavor (even though the data used are largely accessible from the armchair), it is helpful to compare this inquiry to the methodology typically used by linguists in developing and evaluating theories of natural-language syntax. The empirical data for syntactic theory include certain judgments and judgment dispositions of competent language users—specifically, judgments and dispositions regarding the grammaticality or ungrammaticality of various sentence-like strings and the grammatical ambiguity or clarity of various sentences. These judgments are relevant to both psychological theories of human language processing and linguistic theories about the syntax of language itself. Native speakers, after all, are expected to have judgment dispositions about these matters that reflect a solid mastery of their own language (or at least their regional dialect). When native speakers are intersubjectively consistent and uniformly confident about such syntactic judgments, the best psychological explanation is usually that these judgments reflect the speakers\\' syntactic competence, their mastery of the syntactic norms or structures underlying their language. This psychological hypothesis, in turn, directly impacts linguistic theory—under an adequate theory of syntax for the speakers\\' language (or dialect), these syntactic judgments will be correct.\\n\\nSimilar observations apply to hypotheses or theories concerning ideology. Certain robust patterns of judgment among competent users of concepts and language can be plausibly explained as manifestations of the users\\' conceptual and semantic competence. Here too, as with grammaticality judgments, much of the relevant data is readily available, some of it in the form of our own introspectively accessible linguistic intuitions about how to describe various actual and imagined scenarios. Since the evidence these data provide is empirical, it is, of course, fallible. Nevertheless, it can be very strong—comparable in epistemic weight to the empirical evidence that syntactic judgments provide for theories of syntax.\\n\\nConsider, for example, the thesis about the ideology of our concept of water:\\n\\nGiven that the substance we call water on Earth is composed of H₂O molecules, superficially water-like substances can only be considered real water if they too are composed of H₂O molecules.\\n\\nHilary Putnam (1975) convinced nearly the entire philosophical community of this thesis by asking us to consult our intuitions about how to describe his Twin Earth scenario. (The influential arguments of Saul Kripke, 1972, for related ideological theses operate similarly.) We were right to be convinced because the deliverances of our descriptive intuitions likely reflect the proper workings of our own conceptual and semantic competence with the notion of water and are therefore likely correct.\\n\\nPhilosophers have not often been explicit about the nature of ideological investigation in philosophy. When they have been explicit, they typically conceive it as a non-empirical endeavor, pursued through reason alone. However, such inquiry is more credibly construed, especially within the framework of a broadly naturalistic approach to human cognition and epistemology, as broadly empirical, as argued in greater detail elsewhere (Graham and Horgan, 1991, 1994; Henderson and Horgan, 2000; Horgan, 1993).',\n"," '# The Ideology of Folk Psychology: Opulent or Austere?\\n\\nJerry and the eliminativists argue that possessing a language of thought (LT) is a conceptually necessary condition for being a true believer. In contrast, Zenon suggests that the prerequisites for being a true believer are much simpler. He contends that the requirement of an LT cognitive architecture is not inherent in folk psychological concepts, nor are there any other requirements that could, under any likely future developments in cognitive science or neuroscience, be unmet by humans. We will refer to Zenon\\'s view of folk psychology as \"austere,\" while competing views that consider LT possession and other scientifically contentious features as necessary prerequisites for true believerhood will be termed \"opulent\" (cf. Graham and Horgan, 1991, 1994; Horgan, 1993).\\n\\nDetermining whether the ideology of folk psychology is opulent or austere is an empirical question. Here are some empirical arguments supporting the austerity hypothesis over the opulence hypothesis. These arguments are based on data readily available from our own intuitions, yet they remain empirical and thus open to revision.\\n\\nFirst is the argument from recalcitrant intuitions. If we imagine a scenario where the LT hypothesis is proven false and then consider whether it seems appropriate to say, \"Humans do not have beliefs and desires,\" the answer is no. Instead, it seems natural to say, \"Humans have found reasons to believe the LT hypothesis is false.\" If the LT hypothesis were truly embedded in folk psychology, our intuitions should reflect this, making it seem incorrect to describe people in this scenario as having beliefs and desires. However, this is not the case. Therefore, it is likely that our intuitions are correct, suggesting that the ideology of folk psychology is austere regarding the LT hypothesis, not opulent.\\n\\nSecond is the argument from ideological conservatism. Concepts like action, assertion, having reasons, and epistemic warrant are all rooted in folk psychology and assume humans are true believers. These concepts play essential roles in human life that would persist even if the LT hypothesis were false. If folk psychology were committed to an LT, this would contradict the purposes for which these concepts are used. Since human concepts evolve pragmatically, they are unlikely to have more restrictive conditions than necessary. Thus, folk psychology is likely austere regarding the LT hypothesis.\\n\\nThird is the argument from conceivability. While we can imagine the LT hypothesis being false, we cannot conceive of abandoning folk psychological notions like action and assertion. To do so would involve actions and reasons, which are inherently folk psychological. This mismatch is easily explained if folk psychology is conceptually austere, as the concepts would still apply to humans. If folk psychology were committed to an LT, this mismatch would be puzzling. Therefore, the conceivability mismatch supports the austere view of folk psychology over the opulent view.\\n\\nThese arguments are empirical and thus open to revision. However, they suggest that the austere conception of folk psychology aligns better with the evidence than the opulent conception. The convergence of different forms of evidence strengthens the case for the austere view. The arguments also apply to other conceptually grounded conditions proposed by eliminativists, supporting the idea that folk psychology is generally austere.\\n\\nThis leaves open the possibility that some features considered necessary by eliminativists are de facto necessary for true believerhood. However, such debates do not undermine folk psychology. The key point is that no likely scenarios would fail to meet the necessary conditions for true believerhood. If evidence suggested otherwise, it would indicate that certain conditions thought necessary are not truly necessary.',\n"," '# Comments on Lycan\\n\\nIn our understanding of Lycan\\'s anti-eliminativist argument, he interprets eliminativists as relying on supposed conceptually grounded necessary truths. He describes his Moorean argument as fundamentally a comparison of plausibilities: the plausibility of commonsense mental ascriptions (e.g., that Granny wants a beer and believes there is one under the sofa) versus the plausibility of eliminativist assumptions (e.g., that possessing a language of thought is a conceptually grounded necessary condition for being a true believer). Essentially, the Moorean argument hinges on the idea that commonsense claims will always appear more intuitively plausible than eliminativist claims.\\n\\nWhile we tend to agree with this notion, its effectiveness against eliminativism can be questioned. Why should comparative intuitive plausibility hold epistemic authority in debates about eliminativism? Comparative intuitive plausibility can be unreliable, especially when comparing a specific commonsense claim with a general theoretical hypothesis. It is not intuitively plausible that the hands I see are mostly empty space or that simultaneity is relative to a reference frame, yet these are accepted scientific truths. When commonsense claims are compared with theoretical hypotheses that challenge them, defending the former based solely on intuitive plausibility gives undue privilege to common sense. Higher intuitive plausibility does not automatically confer epistemic authority.\\n\\nWe believe Lycan would concur. He states, \"Commonsense beliefs can be corrected, even discarded entirely, by careful empirical investigation and scientific theorizing\" (p. 8). However, he argues that such epistemic authority over common sense can only be granted to empirical scientific hypotheses, well-supported by evidence. It cannot be granted to the \"purely philosophical\" premises he believes eliminativist arguments rely on. He asserts:\\n\\n\"Philosophers are not explorers or scientists. Common sense must yield to evidence, but it need not yield to bare metaphysical pronouncement. No purely philosophical premise can ever legitimately have as strong a claim to our allegiance as a humble commonsense proposition such as Moore\\'s autobiographical one. Science can correct common sense; metaphysics and philosophical \\'intuition\\' can only throw spitballs.\"\\n\\nThus, Lycan\\'s Moorean argument crucially depends on the assumption that eliminativists rely on nonempirical premises, which he claims can never epistemically trump commonsense beliefs.\\n\\nOne might be tempted to engage in debates about whether any nonempirical claim can trump commonsense beliefs and, if so, which kinds can hold this privileged epistemic status and why. However, we can set these issues aside. From our perspective, Lycan\\'s argument is flawed at a more fundamental level: it incorrectly assumes that eliminativist arguments use nonempirical premises. We argue that, although these arguments require premises about putative conceptually grounded necessary conditions for true belief, such premises are empirical ideological hypotheses. In principle, these hypotheses could gain enough evidential support to surpass commonsense claims, like the claim that Granny wants a beer and believes there is one under the sofa. Therefore, Lycan\\'s Moorean argument commits a straw-man fallacy, as it is based on a misinterpretation of eliminativist reasoning.\\n\\nOur own anti-eliminativist approach acknowledges eliminativist assumptions as broadly empirical contentions about the ideology of folk psychological concepts and provides empirical arguments against these assumptions. Certain intuitive, commonsense judgments are involved: for instance, judgments about how to characterize various actual or hypothetical scenarios. However, these commonsense judgments serve not as direct and automatic counters to nonempirical philosophical claims but as data for ideological theorizing—data that may be presumed to stem from our conceptual/semantic competence and thus may reflect the nature of folk psychological concepts.\\n\\nDespite its flaws, Lycan\\'s Moorean argument can be seen as pointing toward the type of reasoning we have presented: a broadly empirical, yet still philosophical, argument for the ideological austerity of folk psychology. Both we and Lycan aim to effectively implement the second strategy we described initially. We assert that our argument achieves this successfully, whereas his does not.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Connectionism and the Propositional Attitudes}\\n\\nThere is a general consensus that if our future comprehensive cognitive theory is classical, folk psychology has a fair chance of being validated. However, there is less agreement on the implications for folk psychology if connectionism prevails in the computational arena. A significant portion of the debate centers around the work of Ramsey, Stich, and Garon (RS&G) (1990), who assert: \"If connectionist hypotheses of the sort we will outline prove correct, then eliminativism about propositional attitudes will also be correct\" (p. 500).\\n\\nThe type of connectionism they refer to involves distributed, superpositional networks designed as models at the psychological level. These models aim to explain psychological data by abstracting from the specific neuroanatomy or neurophysiology of the brain. A \"distributed\" network implies that the information contained in a single proposition is stored across the connection strengths and biases of numerous units. A \"superpositional\" network means that these same connection strengths and unit biases store information related to multiple propositions. For simplicity, we will refer to this type of connectionist network as a \"connectionist* network.\" By \"eliminativism about propositional attitudes,\" RS&G mean that, although propositional attitudes may still be referenced in folk psychological practices, they do not actually exist. It is crucial to note that RS&G\\'s conclusion is conditional. They do not provide reasons to support the claim that our future complete cognitive theory will be a distributed, superpositional connectionist network, although they might believe this. Their primary interest is in arguing that if cognitive science develops in this direction, it spells trouble for folk psychology.\\n\\nWhat supports this conditional, according to RS&G? Their argument is essentially this: Folk psychology characterizes propositional attitudes by a cluster of three features that RS&G term \"propositional modularity.\" The issue is that when examining connectionist* networks that might be expected to contain propositional attitude-like states, these features are absent. Therefore, if our future complete cognitive theory is connectionist*, we must conclude that propositional attitudes do not exist. While this is the argument at a general level, the strategy is to focus on a specific case and assume the argument will generalize. RS&G, in fact, discuss only one propositional attitude—belief—and two particular sample connectionist* networks.\\n\\nNot everyone is convinced. Some philosophers question whether folk psychology is committed to propositional attitudes being propositionally modular in all the ways RS&G require for their argument (Bechtel and Abrahamsen, 1993; Bogdan, 1993; Botterill, 1994; Clark, 1995). Others challenge the claim that connectionist* networks lack the necessary propositional modularity (Forster and Saidel, 1994; Botterill, 1994; Clark, 1995; Smolensky, 1995). Still others critique some of the argument\\'s inferential steps (Egan, 1995; Stich and Warfield, 1995). While many of these critiques raise valid points, there is room for further response. Except for Clark (1995), the complexity of RS&G\\'s argument has not been fully appreciated. Upon closer examination, RS&G\\'s overall argument comprises three subarguments, one for each feature of propositional modularity. The reconstructions of the argument in the literature often focus on one or two of these subarguments. Additionally, because the three strands of the argument have not been clearly separated, there is confusion about what the three features of propositional modularity are supposed to be. Specifically, regarding the feature of semantic interpretability, insufficient attention has been given to the types of kinds folk psychology assumes and what kinds connectionist* networks allow.\\n\\nThe purpose of this chapter is to systematically present the case against RS&G, addressing all three subarguments. In building this systematic case, I will review the various critical points made to date and RS&G\\'s responses (where available). I will also introduce some of my own insights. Ultimately, the conclusion will be that, despite some critics missing the nuances of RS&G\\'s argument, their overall assessment is roughly correct. If our future cognitive theory is connectionist*, it does not necessarily imply the non-existence of propositional attitudes.',\n"," '\\\\section*{Setting the Stage}\\n\\nTo thoroughly understand RS\\\\&G\\'s argument, we must examine four key aspects: (1) the characteristics of the two sample connectionist* networks, (2) the criteria for a network to potentially contain belief-like states, (3) the concept of propositional modularity, and (4) RS\\\\&G\\'s reasoning for why connectionist* networks expected to contain belief-like states do not actually possess them.\\n\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item RS\\\\&G illustrate their argument by constructing two sample connectionist* networks. Network A is designed to evaluate the truth or falsity of sixteen propositions, such as \"dogs have fur,\" \"dogs have paws,\" \"cats have paws,\" and \"fish have eggs.\" It is a three-layer, feed-forward network with sixteen input units, four hidden units, and one output unit. Each proposition is encoded as a sequence of sixteen 0s and 1s. For instance, \"dogs have fur\" is encoded as 11000011 00001111. An output close to 1 indicates the proposition is judged true, while an output close to 0 indicates it is judged false. The network is trained using backpropagation until it consistently outputs values greater than 0.9 for true propositions and less than 0.1 for false ones. Network B is similar to Network A but includes one additional proposition. Like Network A, Network B is designed to evaluate propositions, contains four hidden units, and is trained using backpropagation.\\n\\n\\\\item RS\\\\&G\\'s argument hinges on the notion that among the vast array of distributed, superpositional connectionist networks, there exists a subset where belief-like states would naturally be found, if they exist. A belief-like state is one that possesses propositional content and fulfills a functional role akin to that of beliefs, as determined by folk psychological generalizations (e.g., beliefs combined with desires lead to intentions to act). RS\\\\&G do not extensively discuss this subset of networks but focus on their two sample networks, which crudely model the capacity to judge the truth or falsity of specific propositions. This capacity presumably involves beliefs, as folk psychology would explain that we judge a proposition $p$ to be true if we believe $p$, and false if we believe it is not the case that $p$. Consider the various cognitive capacities that, at the folk psychological level, we explain by attributing one or more beliefs to the subject. These are our \"belief capacities.\" The networks RS\\\\&G are interested in belong to the class of connectionist* networks that aim to account for these belief capacities.\\n\\n\\\\item A crucial component of RS\\\\&G\\'s argument is the claim that propositional attitudes exhibit a cluster of features termed \"propositional modularity.\" Propositional modularity is defined as follows: \"Propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behavior\" (RS\\\\&G, 1990, p. 504). Initially, each component is characterized in natural folk psychological terms, although, as RS\\\\&G develop their argument, the notion of functional discreteness begins to acquire architectural dimensions.\\n\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\nRS\\\\&G initially describe the components of propositional modularity as follows:\\n\\nFunctional Discreteness: It is often reasonable to assert that a person has acquired or lost a single memory or belief. For example, it might be claimed that when Henry awoke from his nap, he had completely forgotten that the car keys were hidden in the refrigerator, though he remembered everything else (1990, p. 504).\\n\\nSemantic Interpretability: Common sense psychology generalizes in terms of the semantic properties of attitudes. A belief has a specific effect or cause by virtue of being the belief that $p$. Thus, common sense psychology treats predicates expressing these semantic properties, like \"believes that the train is late,\" as projectable predicates suitable for nomological or law-like generalizations (1990, p. 504).\\n\\nIndependent Causal Role: From a common sense perspective, a person may have several belief clusters, any of which might lead to further inferences. When an inference is drawn, folk psychology assumes it is an empirical question what it was inferred from, typically with a determinate answer. For instance, if Inspector Clouseau believes the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel and arrived back on the morning train, and also believes the hotel is closed for the season and the train is out of service, he might infer the butler is lying. Folk psychology presumes the inference could be based on beliefs about the hotel, the train, or both. It is possible, from a common sense perspective, that although Clouseau has long known the hotel is closed, this belief played no role in his inference on that occasion. Once again, common sense psychology invokes distinct propositional attitudes, one causally active and the other inert (1990, p. 506).\\n\\nRS\\\\&G also provide an example where folk psychology explains an action based on a specific set of beliefs and desires, even though the agent had multiple belief-desire sets that could have led to the action.\\n\\n4. RS\\\\&G\\'s overall argument is divided into a main argument and three subarguments, each corresponding to one of the three features of propositional modularity.']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42}],"source":["repo_name = \"Chickward/processes\"\n","filename = f\"{num_samples}_process_revised_existing_texts_seed{seed}_{gpt_model_title}\"\n","\n","if gpt_gen:\n","    save_and_upload(process_revised_existing_texts)\n","process_revised_existing_texts, response_revised_existing_texts = download_and_process_file(False)\n","\n","response_revised_existing_texts = [text.replace(\"**Revised Text:**\", \"\", 1).strip() for text in response_revised_existing_texts]\n","\n","response_revised_existing_texts"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739813113154,"user":{"displayName":"Sam","userId":"18172871330063317003"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"KvRhYEqfh88_","outputId":"425e90d1-e21e-4766-faf2-ab742cffcf92"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["# Connectionism and Teleology\n","\n","In this section, I will explore some remaining issues related to connectionism and teleology, offering preliminary remarks on each.\n","\n","Homuncular Functionalism posits that psychological and biological entities are organisms in a robust sense: they are teleologically integrated systems of organs, each defined by its specific functions. These organs are composed of smaller organs, creating a hierarchical structure. But how does this concept apply to connectionism?\n","\n","A connectionist network can indeed function as an organ, meaning an organ could be structured like a connectionist network without any inherent conflict. A slightly more intriguing question is whether the components of a connectionist network can themselves be considered organs in a teleological sense. Do they serve the network as units and connections? In biological systems, there seems to be no reason why they couldn't. Connectionist networks are highly integrated systems, and their presence in biological organisms is presumably not accidental.\n","\n","A more compelling question is whether an individual unit within a network has a specific function. Even if units generally serve the network, it may not be possible to assign a unique function to each one. In \"localist\" connectionist systems, where units are linked to specific propositions, this association can be seen as a representational function. The same applies to \"global representation\" systems, where units represent small bits of information or complex disjunctions of real-world propositions. This piecemeal representation, however modest, can be considered functional.\n","\n","What about units that do not represent anything, even in a fragmented or disjunctive manner? Some proponents of connectionism, following the traditions of Wittgenstein and Ryle, aim to understand intelligent behavior without relying on internal representations. As Stanley Munsat has noted, connectionism is \"AI for Wittgensteinians,\" offering \"representation without representation.\" A stronger thesis might argue that no part of a connectionist network, even a large distributed part, represents anything.\n","\n","However, it's unclear if non-representing units exist in a network that processes representations as input and output. First, no connectionist researcher I've encountered avoids representational language. Once a network is trained, its creators naturally use intentional ascription, which aids further investigation and use. Second, even if a researcher personally refrains from ascribing content to units, one could argue that, given a representational interpretation of inputs and outputs, an interpretation for any unit can be constructed once the system is fully trained (as suggested by Clark in this volume).\n","\n","Assuming this view is correct, it doesn't necessarily mean a unit's function is to carry its algorithmically constructed content. This content might be seen as a form of pleiotropism. It need not be true that under normal circumstances, a unit would carry that content, so it doesn't have that job in a strong sense. However, since a unit carries content as a result of the network's proper functioning and its role within the network, there may be a weaker, derivative sense of \"function\" to consider. Further distinctions are likely needed.\n","\n","A final caution on this unresolved issue: Questions of organhood and function differ from those of morphological salience and modularity. An organ need not be physically localized within its system; especially in the brain, neural patterns may have specific functions at certain times but be diffusely distributed. Moreover, an organ need not be modular in a technical sense, such as Jerry Fodor's (1983) concept of informational encapsulation; some organs may freely exchange information with many others, as seen in the human speech center.\n"]}],"source":["for i in range(1):\n","    random_index = random.randint(0, len(response_revised_existing_texts) - 1)\n","

Functionally Discrete States, and Connectionist Networks: A Comment on Ramsey, Stich, and Garon}\n","At the moment it is still very unclear whether connectionist models of cognitive function will turn out to be consonant with the commonsense theory of propositional attitudes many claim to discern in our folk psychology. William Ramsey, Stephen Stich, and Joseph Garon (in Greenwood [1991], pp. 93-119) have argued that it is at least problematic whether models inspired by a particular family of connectionist hypotheses can be compatible with the propositional modularity that characterizes the central folk psychological state of belief. If they are right about this, the success of such models (a matter for future research) would constitute empirical support for eliminativism. I shall argue that they have not shown these models to pose any particular threat to the 'Panglossian prospect' (Stich [1983], Ch. 11) of a tolerably smooth, ontologically conservative integration of folk psychology with cognitive science. On the contrary, there is one important aspect of the ordinary concept of belief that these models promise to cohere with rather neatly.\n","\n","The point I intend to make is, in truth, a very simple and modest one. But in order to see where the rescue operation to revive faith in folk psychology comes in I need to tell the first part of the story in much the same way as Ramsey et al., starting by saying a little about what they mean by 'propositional modularity'. This they define as a cluster of claims, implicit in folk psychology, to the effect that 'propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behaviour' (Greenwood [1991], p. 97). That commonsense psychology is committed to the reality of such internal aetiological structure is, of course, not an uncontroversial claim. Ramsey et al. offer three illustrative examples in support of the propositional modularity of folk psychology. One of these is just an exemplification of Davidson's durable argument (Davidson [1963]) that since an agent might have two belief-desire pairs that would justify the performance of a particular action, and yet only one of them be the actual reason for which she so acted, we do in general attribute causal efficacy to the reasons for which agents act. A second, closely analogous, illustration involves inference rather than action. A thinker has two distinct beliefclusters, from either of which a further belief might be inferred. When the inference is drawn, folk psychology takes it to be an empirical question which 'typically has a determinate answer' from which set of beliefs the inference was made. The remaining illustration is intended to exemplify the fact that folk psychology allows that a person may acquire or lose just a single belief or memory. This case seems much more questionable than the other two, given the apparently holistic character of folk psychological ascriptive practices. That reservation apart, I have no need to quarrel with the claim that propositional attitudes are taken by folk psychology to be functionally discrete and causally active. The question to be addressed is whether this is a theoretical commitment that may jeopardize the future of folk psychology. Following Ramsey et al., I am concentrating on the case of belief, and there is no doubting that beliefs are semantically interpretable.\n","\n","So what are they like, these connectionist models which may, if successful, threaten folk psychology? It's time to wheel on the main exhibit in the case for the conditional prosecution (i.e. conditional upon the success of connectionist modelling) of folk psychology. Ramsey et al. very helpfully provide us with a nice little trained-up specimen, which serves to make the discussion more concrete and is simple enough for non-specialists to comprehend. Using back propagation, they trained up a three-tiered, feed-forward network with sixteen input nodes, four hidden nodes, and one output node, on a set of sixteen distinct input strings. Taking an output higher than 0.9 as a positive response ('true') and an output lower than 0.1 as a negative response ('false'), a suitably generous interpretation of the inputs as encoding propositions enables us to regard the network, after training, as an information-store or greatly simplified memory-model. The interpretations assigned to the sixteen inputs were a set of sixteen propositions, ten true and six false, about dogs, cats, and fish such as Cats have paws, Fish have scales, and Dogs have fins. Since the assignments are largely arbitrary, there is no particular problem about input strings being taken as encoding propositions. We may find it helpful to think of a particular input as an interrogation of the network (Fish have fins?), or an instruction to determine a truth-value by computation.\n","\n","The trained-up network (labelled Network A by Ramsey et al.) with its various connection weights and biases is displayed in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the network's response to the interrogation Dogs have fur? Ramsey et al. also report the striking result that when a second network with exactly the same structure of units was trained up on a set of inputs that included the encoding of just one single additional proposition (Fish have eggs) they obtained a completely different set of weights and biases (their Network B-not illustrated; see Greenwood [1991], p. 110, for the details).\n","\n","Network A 'remembers' that dogs have fur. Why, after all, can it not be thought of as having a single functionally discrete representational state with the content that dogs have fur? Certainly there is some point to describing the network as informationally holistic. There is no particular area within the network where that information is stored; rather the information is distributed throughout the network with its 'trained-up' set of weights and biases. I cannot draw a circle round a particular part of the network and say: That's where the information is retrieved from in order to give an affirmative answer to an appropriate input. The essential points Ramsey et al. are making are that, firstly, several (and presumably in a more realistically complex model very many) connection strengths, biases, and hidden units are involved in the computation of the input value for any given input string; and, secondly, any particular unit, weight or bias encodes information about several (and presumably in a more realistically complex model very many) different propositions.\n","\n","That's clear enough. But Ramsey et al. invite us to conclude that there is an incompatibility between the holistic distribution of information in the network and the propositional modularity of commonsense psychology. Yet it seems to me that the features of holistic distribution they emphasize do not establish the claim that the network does not contain (nor, in general, that networks of this kind cannot contain) functionally discrete representational states. The claim about functional discreteness was, quite evidently, never to be taken as a spatial claim: it did not say that intentional states occupy parts of the brain that other intentional states can't reach because they mutually exclude each other. Folk psychology is surely not committed to intentional states being discrete in the same way as impenetrable physical objects-to being mutually exclusive residents of particular cerebral locations.\n","\n","I would suggest that what goes for cerebral locations also applies to the functional locations supplied by a cognitive model. There is no reason to impute to folk psychology a commitment to beliefs being functionally discrete in the very specialized and technical sense of being realized in a mutually exclusive way in the functional locations (e.g. processing units) of our best cognitive model. In accepting that intentional states (and, specifically, beliefs) are functionally discrete, we accepted that they had distinct causal roles in inference and the production of action. If we are not to foreclose the possibility that folk psychology is implemented on connectionist networks, we must allow that there may be different levels of functioning, and with different levels of functioning we have different sorts of functional discreteness. To suppose otherwise would be tacitly to presuppose that only very simple mappings between folk psychological representational states and states of connectionist networks are admissible. That is not a presupposition that can be extracted from the causal role (Ramsey et al.'s propositional modularity) assigned to beliefs in folk psychology.\n","\n","If we look elsewhere than the basic functioning locations (processing units) supplied by the connectionist model, there is a rather obvious candidate to play the part of functionally discrete representational state in networks like A , and that is the activation pattern of the hidden nodes. In the example given this activation pattern is the 4 -tuple $(21,75,73,12)$. This activation pattern is a unique state of the system, and since it does cause the output it is qualified to be functionally discrete in the production of behaviour and inference.\n","\n","Ramsey et al. have heard this one before (listing it as objection 2 b to their position), and have a counter-argument ready. Their reply is that activation patterns are not the sort of things that could be beliefs, because beliefs and propositional memories are typically stable and enduring cognitive states. Consider your belief that kangaroos are marsupials (or dolphins are mammals, or Aristotle tutored Alexander, or whatever). You have had it for years, along with a host of other beliefs, and yet it probably has not been activated much recently, until you just received that bit of input. A network can only contain a single activation pattern at any given time. So it cannot contemporaneously contain a multitude of beliefs realized as activation patterns.\n","\n","Thinking this disposes of the suggestion that activation patterns could be equated with beliefs, they proceed to consider the suggestion that beliefs could be regarded as dispositions to produce activation patterns. We can discern these dispositions in the network in the set of weights and biases. These are enduring states all right, and so not to be rejected as candidates for belief-like status on the same grounds that activation patterns were. But, say Ramsey et al., they are not functionally discrete. The relations of connectivity in the network that are the dispositions to produce a given activation pattern (and its subsequent output) are the very same relations that produce different activation patterns in response to different inputs. So there can be no question of treating such dispositions as causally isolable in the production of inference.\n","\n","Here comes my very simple point. I suggest that as soon as we introduce a distinction between an active belief and a belief as a mere disposition we can see that the alleged incompatibility between the way the connectionist network functions and the way folk psychology represents us as functioning simply disappears. Certainly, beliefs can persist as dispositions over long periods of time. But while they are dispositions they are mere potentialities to think certain occurrent thoughts. While they are mere potentialities, there is no reason whatsoever to suppose that they are functionally discrete. They are not fulfilling any particular causal roles, because they are not fulfilling any active causal roles at all. All we need to say, then (in order to deal with the problem from a Panglossian perspective), is that beliefs as dispositions are dispositions to enter states that are functionally discrete. Those states could be, for all we know, neural analogues of connectivist activation patterns.\n","\n","Distinguishing between active beliefs and beliefs-as-dispositions is by no means an ad hoc manÅ“uvre. It's a distinction that one has to resort to quite often in the philosophy of mind. It's also a well-known story from the history of philosophy of mind that some accounts of belief (e.g. Hume's) fit active belief-episodes better while other accounts (e.g. Ryle's) fit long-term dispositions better. The general feeling is that we need to accommodate both. Perhaps folk psychology is not particularly well geared up to mark the distinction, so that we have to talk about 'occurrent thoughts', 'acts of judgement' on the one hand, and 'merely dispositional beliefs' and 'longstanding belief-states' on the other. In order to render the distinction salient, for theory of theory of mind purposes, we may choose to stretch the normal vocabulary of folk psychology just a little. Nobody, however, has ever suggested that the availability of the distinction should, in itself, lead us to proclaim that folk psychology is radically mistaken.\n","\n","If anything, the preceding remarks underestimate the extent to which the connectionist model presented by Ramsey et al. is congenial to the role of belief in folk psychology. For folk psychology (in its English idiom, at any rate) does have a way of observing the distinction, which philosophers of mind are liable to obscure through their penchant for using the term 'belief' as a cognitive all-rounder. We should not neglect the more common psychological verb 'think'. Talk of thinking that usually denotes an occurrent cognitive episode, rather than a long-standing dispositional belief. It is pertinent to note that one method of deciding a self-attribution of belief is to ask yourself the question 'Is it true that $p$ ?'. You find yourself thinking 'Yes, $p$ is true' and are then ready to say 'I believe that $p$ '. (For the significance of this route to self-attribution in relation to the theoretical character of folk psychology, see Carruthers [forthcoming].) It does look as if Network A would model this process rather nicely, if only it could be equipped with some way of interrogating itself. At any rate, it seems clear that commonsense psychology has no difficulty in countenancing both occurrent belief and standing belief, even though it may sometimes mark the difference rather quietly (e.g. by use of tense, as in 'he is thinking that' v . 'he thinks that'), and sometimes wrap it in a more elaborate context (as in 'Of course I knew that all'along. It's just that it didn't occur to me at the time').\\\\\n","So, at the present stage of our knowledge of such models, it does seem possible to regard connectionist 'memory' networks as modelling both occurrent episodes of thought and the background retention of a stock of dispositional beliefs. Is there, however, a problem with taking long-standing dispositional beliefs to be realized in-in effect, to be stored in-the system of weights and biases of a connectionist network? It is certainly true that connectionist storage differs in a number of interesting ways from any system in which distinct contents are stored discretely. One such way is that a connectionist model of storage appears able to dispense with the distinction between core beliefs and dispositionally activated beliefs that any system of discrete storage is going to require. As Dennett pointed out (Dennett [1975]), any system in which beliefs are stored in a propositional or encoded form must acknowledge a limit on available neural storage capacity that is exceeded by the indefinitely large number of background beliefs that can be ascribed to an individual. This shortfall in storage capacity can be handled by postulating a stock of core beliefs which are augmented by the operation of 'an extrapolator-deducer mechanism attached to the core library' (Dennett [1978], p. 45). Since a given set of weights and biases in a connectionist network can compute responses to a large number of propositions, including propositions that were not part of the original training set, connectionist storage is not committed to this distinction between core beliefs and other dispositional beliefs. To the extent that the distinction is motivated only by theoretical requirement (and that does seem to be the case), one could regard this as an economy of storage that counts in favour of connectionist cognitive modelling. This is, admittedly, far from being a decisive point in favour of connectionism, since some sort of extrapolator-deducer mechanism is going to be required anyway for cases of genuine inference. The fact that realizing that one has any of a multitude of background beliefs-such as (e.g.) that Zebras don't wear overcoats in the wild, or that Australia is larger than the Isle of Mandoes not involve conscious inference is, on our present knowledge of cognitive function, equally compatible with these being cases of holistic storage of information or cases of subconscious inference.\n","\n","But what about lack of stability in the set of connection strengths? As noted above, the inclusion of a single additional proposition in the training set generated a network (Network B) with a completely different set of weights and biases. The first thing to say about this is that we need to find out whether this is a general feature of connectionist modelling, or just a feature of mini-models like the one developed by Ramsey et al. An attempt at a more realistic modelling of memory storage would have to involve both a greatly enlarged training set and also some way of simulating the possibility of on-going retraining. So far as I know, it is an open question whether larger and more realistic models would also be less unstable under retraining, although it is at least clear that the connection strengths must be sensitive to the acquisition of new information, in so far as this constitutes an addition to the training set rather than mere confirmation of something already computable (and hence already implicit within a set of weights and biases). But whatever further research reveals about that, I do not see why it should prevent us from considering dispositional beliefs to be realized in the weights and biases of a connectionist model. For the constraint that folk psychology imposes upon the realization of dispositional beliefs amounts, so far as I can see, to no more than this: that they should be realized in whatever state yields, upon activation, a causal role appropriate to the content of the particular belief in question. Any network that has been successfully trained up is going to satisfy that constraint, because it is the criterion for successful training.\n","\n","My conclusion is that there is no reason to suppose that the prospect of a connectionist modelling of higher cognitive functions is going to reveal that folk psychology is radically mistaken. Not yet, anyway.\n","\n","[80]\n","\\section*{1 What the Folk Think}\n","Ramsey, Stich and Garon, in chapter 8 (henceforth RS\\&G), depict the common-sense understanding of belief as involving a crucial commitment to what they call propositional modularity. The thesis of propositional modularity claims that propositional attitudes are: 'functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behaviour' (chapter, p. 315). The attitudes are functionally discrete in so far as we are happy to speak of agents gaining or losing individual beliefs (chapter 8, p. 316). They are semantically interpretable in so far as folk psychology condones generalizations based on the semantic properties of beliefs. We group people together as all believing that soand-so, and expect lawful regularities in their behaviour to be captured as a result. The predicate 'believes that P ' is thus meant to be projectable in the sense of Goodman (1965). Finally, these functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states are said to play a role in the production of behaviour. An individual belief can be cited as the cause of a particular action. It is this last requirement which, in the end, turns out to afford the best chance of supporting the eliminativist case. It will be wise, then, to cite their own examples in a little detail.\n","\n","The first concerns Alice, who wishes to send some e-mail, and believes she can do it from her office. She also wants to speak to her research assistant and believes she can do this at her office. But, and here is the crux, she might (according to folk psychological views about belief) go to the office as a result of just one of these two belief/desire complexes, both of which she possesses, and either (or both) of which would be sufficient to yield the behaviour (Chapter 8, p. 317).\n","\n","The second example concerns Inspector Clouseau. Suppose Clouseau believes that the butler said that he spent the evening at the village hotel, and that he took the morning train home. And suppose Clouseau also believes (a) that the hotel is closed and (2) that the morning train is not running. Then Clouseau could infer (given his knowledge of what the butler said) that the butler is lying. And he could do so by either or both of two routes. He could spot the inconsistency over the hotel, or the train, or both. But it at least makes sense, on the folk psychological conception, to imagine that he in fact draws the conclusion solely by reflection on one of the two pieces of evidence. In short, 'we see common-sense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert (Chapter 8, pp. 317-18).\n","\n","In what follows, I shall use a different example which I find clearer, and which preserves all the essential structure of the authors' own cases. Consider Lesley. Lesley has the following two desires:\n","\n","She desires a pint of Coopers\\\\\n","She desires to sit near an open fire\n","\n","She also has the following long-standing beliefs:\n","\n","She believes that the Dingo and Whistle serves draught Guinness She believes that the Dingo and Whistle has an open fire\n","\n","One night, while out walking, she reads and understands the pub sign 'Dingo and Whistle'. She goes in. And yet, it makes sense to suppose that she went in solely because of her desire for an open fire, even though the desire for Coopers, on its own, would have been sufficiently potent to cause her to enter.\n","\n","The general form of the claim, then, is that someone might believe all of:\\\\\n","$P, P \\rightarrow Q Q \\rightarrow S, P \\rightarrow R, R \\rightarrow S$ but on a given occasion happen to use only the $Q$-information in coming to the conclusion that $S$.\n","\n","Traditional AI models, such as production systems and semantic networks, are (RS\\&G claim) visibly compatible with the thesis of propositional modularity. In a semantic network, for example, distinct propositions will be represented as distinct node-and-link patterns. The compatibility is even more apparent where there is storage of sentence- like symbol structures. But with highly distributed sub-symbolic connectionist models, according to RS\\&G, the compatibility disappears.\n","\n","It would be unduly repetitious to spend much time describing this style of connectionist model here (it is done at length by Smolensky in chapter 2; see also Clark, 1989). But a few facts will help. First, the models in question represent data using densely connected networks of simple processing units connected in parallel by positively and negatively weighted links. Secondly, the style of representation involves distributed superpositional storage. Distributed here means that what might look like one item of information in a public formalism (e.g. 'Fido is a dog') is stored as a set of weights across many units, and these are sensitive to semantic regularities which are finer-grained than the public symbols. Thus 'dog' might be a pattern across banks of units which represent colour, eating habits, size, sound and so on. As representations become more and more distributed, the interpretability of individual units decreases until at the limit we cannot say what feature they encode. The use of distributed representations makes superpositional storage easy. For what this means is that one set of units and weights can be finely tuned so that it is able, upon being given appropriate inputs, to call up many different patterns of activation which code for various items, e.g. a network which stores 'dog' as a distributed pattern of size, sound and eating habit features could find one set of weights which can give appropriate patterns to represent dog, cat, calf and so on. It could also store quite orthogonal patterns (e.g. for 'bagel') (see McClelland et al., 1986, ch. 17).\n","\n","Connectionist systems thus encode knowledge as complex patterns of positive and negative weights linking up simple processing units. These units are often arranged into three functional layers. An input layer, in which the network can be given a cue for a particular act of recall or processing; a hidden unit layer, in which the complex pattern of weights is further choreographed by units with activation thresholds which then pass activation values to a final layer of output units which express the system's considered response to the input. The system thus expresses its knowledge as a pattern of activation consequent upon a given input.\n","\n","What is it, then, that the folk are meant to find embarrassing?\n","\n","[81]\n","\\section*{2 Two Eliminativist Arguments}\n","RS8G offer two main arguments whose purpose is to highlight an alleged incompatibility between connectionist storage and representation and the assumptions of propositional modularity. These are:\\\\\n","1 An argument concerning superpositional storage and discrete causal efficacy.\\\\\n","2 An argument concerning natural kinds.\\\\\n","Let us rehearse these in turn.\n","\n","Superpositional storage\n","We are asked to consider a network (called Network A) whose task is to answer yes or no to 16 questions. The questions are posed by giving the network a coding for a proposition as input (e.g. dogs have fur) and reading off a yes/no answer by consulting a single output unit which is interpreted to mean 'yes' if it comes on, and 'no' if it stays off. It is a simple matter to deploy a standard connectionist learning algorithm to train a network to succeed in this task. The trained network will take a vector of values across input units to code up the proposition and learn  a set of weights leading to and from the hidden units which will mediate just the input-output profile we desire. Thus, suppose we have 16 input units and code 'dogs' as the pattern 11000011 across the first eight and code 'have fur' as the pattern 00001111 across the last eight. The system learns to take input 1100001100001111 and give output 1 (i.e. 'yes') at the sole output unit. The learnt weights connect the 16 input units to a layer of four hidden units and on to the output unit. The important fact is that this single array of weights must be subtly adjusted (via an automatic learning algorithm) so as to work not just for one proposition but for all 16 . The knowledge is thus stored superpositionally in a single, subtly orchestrated, set of weights.\n","\n","At this point we are already, according to RS\\&G, starting to cross swords with folk psychology. For the folk would like to say that it is the belief that dogs have fur which causes them to say yes to the question 'do dogs have fur?' But if our memory was organized in the superpositional connectionist style, it seems unclear that it makes sense to say that it was that particular piece of stored information (rather than the rest) which caused the output. As they put it:\n","\n","The information encoded in Network A is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network. Whenever information is extracted ... many connection strengths, many biases and many hidden units play a role in the computation. And any particular weight or unit or bias will help to encode information about many different propositions. It simply makes no sense to ask whether or not the representation of a particular proposition plays a causal role in the network's computation. (chapter 8, pp. 326-7)\n","\n","In other words, it is meant to be no more the case that it was the network's knowledge that dogs have paws that caused the 'yes' output than it was the case that its knowledge that, say, cats have fur, caused it. For it is all stored in a single set of weights.\n","\n","Natural kinds\n","The second argument of RS\\&G I dub 'the argument from natural kinds'. It goes like this. Suppose you train a second network (B) on 17 propositions (the same 16 as network A, plus an extra one). Network B will learn a set of weights which are globally different from those of network A. This is because the use of superpositional storage means that the may you encode a proposition is crucially dependent on what other knowledge the network has to store.  The result is that a 17 proposition network must store all 17 propositions in a way subtly different from the way the 16 proposition network stores its 16 , even if the 16 are a subset of the 17 . Contrast this with the more conventional procedure of adding a declarative representation (e.g. a sentence) to a list structure. The lists\n","\n","List 1 dogs have fur cats have fleas\\\\\n","List 2 dogs have fur cats have fleas cats have fur have a common typographic subset. And such commonality can be preserved in traditional symbolic models. But it seems to disappear in superpositional connectionist storage.\n","\n","The conclusion which this is meant to force on us is that where folk psychology finds a natural psychological kind (all the believers that dogs have fur) Connectionist psychology does not - for the units-and-weights description of all the various networks which might encode such knowledge need have no common sub-part. As RS\\&G put it:\n","\n","The moral here is that though there are indefinitely many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur just as well as Network A does, these networks have no projectible features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory [thus] the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind at all, but simply a chaotically disjunctive set. (Chapter 8, p. 329)\n","\n","Finally, let us note that the examples of Alice, Clouseau and (in our case) Lesley are used to highlight the tension already suggested in Argument 1 by stressing the folk's apparent commitment to what I shall call the equipotency claim, viz.\n","\n","Equipotency claim: An agent may have two long-standing beliefs which are both equipotent (both apt to cause the same piece of behaviour on a given occasion) AND YET the agent may as a matter of fact act on the basis of only one of the two beliefs.\n","\n","The worry is that, given the facts about superpositional storage chronicled in Argument 1, it seems to make no sense to suppose that one of the beliefs rather than the other is active at a given moment.\n","\n","I think we can capture the spirit of the eliminativist arguments in a simple picture. Imagine the following two ways of storing sentences. In the first way, you keep a discrete token of each sentence on a slip of paper in a drawer. It is then easy to see how to use the tokens one at a time. In the second way, you token each sentence as a pot of coloured ink. You then take a vat of water and throw in all the pots. It is now not easy to see how to use the colours separately. And worse still, the resultant overall colour will vary according to the global set of pots of ink put in. The commonality between various tokeners of the same sentence now seems lost to view. The question then is: how could a vatand-inks (read 'superpositional connectionist') style of storage be compatible with the assumption of propositional modularity?\n","\n","There are three ways out. We might just deny that the folk care about propositional modularity. I shan't do this. Or we might try to show that propositional modularity is safe whatever turns up in the head. I don't have a satisfactory way of doing that, though I discuss the matter a little in section 5. Finally, we might argue that distributed, sub-symbolic, superpositional connectionist models are actually more structured than RS\\&G think, and hence visibly compatible with the requirements of propositional modularity. To this end we might question the choice of a units-and-weights description as the sole description of a network for the purposes of a scientific psychology. That sounds like a good idea, and I pursue it in the next two sections.\n","\n","[83]\n","\\section*{4 Eliminativism Revisited}\n","Recall the argument from superpositional storage. The question was how can it make sense, given that many weights are active in causing an output and each weight participates in the storage of many items of data, to highlight a particular belief as causing an output?\n","\n","Now let us shift our attention a little. Let us focus not on the active weights but upon what they are geared to $d o$. What they are geared to do is to generate a pattern of hidden unit activity which then causes the output.\n","\n","Consider further the kind of output we expect a real-belief encoding system to drive. Such a system must drive a large and subtle set of behaviours. In effect, it will be more like NETtalk (which has a large bank of output units) than the Networks A and B (which have only one unit, with two degrees of freedom). Such a system is very likely to succumb to some form of post hoc analysis.\n","\n","Suppose it does so. In fact, let's suppose that it succumbs to a cluster analysis whose labels involve semantic entities. In such a case, we are able to untangle the superpositional storage by recourse to the higherlevel descriptions of the hidden unit activation states. Thus if, on being given a certain input, the network goes into a hidden unit activation state which falls squarely into a cluster we have found reason to label 'dogs have fur', we would be warranted (regardless of superpositional storage) in saying that it gave a certain output because at that moment it believed that dogs have fur.\n","\n","These are, of course, big ifs: if the network succumbs to such an analysis and if it warrants labels like 'dogs have fur'. But the move is dialectically sound. For RS\\&G purport to argue directly from distributed, sub-symbolic storage and representation to eliminativism. The mere possibility of a cluster analysis turning out as I've suggested shows that there is no direct inference of the kind claimed. For it should be obvious that if we can unpick the superpositional storage as suggested, then the arguments from natural kinds and equipotency are immediately undermined.\n","\n","Thus consider once again the argument from natural kinds. The pivotal fact was the lack of any units-and-weights kind uniting nets $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}$ and so on. But we can now see that RS\\&G being unduly reductionist about well-motivated kinds. The fact that networks which are quite various at the units-and-connectivity level of description are treated as instances of a psychological kind need occasion no more surprise than the fact that an Amstrad and an Atari may, subject to running the right software, be treated as instances of a computational kind (e.g. as instantiations of a certain word-processing package). All that the varietyof-networks point establishes is that Connectionist psychology may need at times to avail itself of higher-level descriptions than units, connections and weights descriptions. But the example of cluster analysis shows that it is possible to reveal that a whole set of networks fall into an equivalence class defined by the way their various assignments of weights divide the spacing of possible input patterns into significant sub-spaces. Thus it would be perfectly legitimate (given the common clustering profile) to assign all the instances of NETtalk to a psychological kind even though they look very different at the units-andweights level. Such a grouping might help us explain some shared error patterns and the relative difficulty of processing various inputs. Of course, as Churchland (1989) points out, for some explanatory purposes (e.g. predicting how future learning will affect weight distributions) the differences will make a difference. My point is only that there may be some legitimate psychological-explanatory interests which call for the higher-level grouping provided by the cluster analysis.\n","\n","The basic philosophical point here is a very familiar one. Good explanations may demand the grouping together of systems which, at a low enough level of physical description, form a 'chaotically disjunctive set'. Thus economics may group an earth community and an antimatter-earth community together as instantiating Keynesian economic systems. And we are probably all familiar with Putnam's peg-and-hole example (see Putnam, 1981) in which the explanation of variously constituted square pegs passing through square holes is to be given in terms of common higher-level properties of rigidity, solidity and so on.\n","\n","Finally, there was the matter of equipotency. The worry, recall, was that it seemed to make no sense to suppose that an agent could have two beliefs, each capable of causing a given action, and yet only one of which did, as a matter of fact, cause the action. But now consider the case of Lesley's two beliefs (one about Coopers, one about the open fire). It is a simple matter to establish that the system must in general be capable of action which is appropriate to each belief individually (e.g. it must be capable of some range of actions which are beer-related and not fire-related). For otherwise the description of the network as knowing the two facts would be unwarranted. But this requires that the system be capable of a set of hidden unit activation patterns which are associated with the beer-belief, and a different (perhaps partially overlapping) set capable of powering different outputs, and associated with the firebelief. So we can say that one belief rather than the other was active just in case, for example, we found an instance of activation in the beercluster and not in the fire-cluster (this kind of response, in RS\\&G, is accredited to Adrian Cussins and Gary Cottrell).\n","\n","RS\\&G respond by saying that it is a mistake to identify the belief state with the transient activation state. Thus they write that:\\\\\n","in common-sense psychology beliefs and propositional memories are typically of substantial duration . . . An activation pattern, however, is not an enduring state of a network . . [for example] there is an enormous number of . . . beliefs that you've had for years. But it makes no sense to suppose that a network could have many activation patterns continuously over a long period of time. At any given time a network exhibits at most one pattern of activation. (Chapter 8, p. 331)\n","\n","Suppose we accept this. The next obvious move is to suggest that we might identify the belief not with the transient activation pattern but with the long-standing disposition to produce that activation pattern in a given circumstance. This move in the dialectic is credited to Ned Block and Frank Jackson. The trouble is, of course, that it is not obvious that the various dispositions said to correspond to various beliefs are sufficiently extricable from one another, qua subvening states of the system, to count as the 'discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requiresâ€™ (Chapter 8, p. 333).\n","\n","But this just muddies the waters unnecessarily. Beliefs need to be long-standing states, yes. And a belief-in-action needs to be capable of having a functionally discrete realization, yes. But the folk are nowhere committed to the view that the belief-in-action and the long-standing stored state must be physically identical. The long-standing stored state may be the disposition, given inputs $A-F$ to propagate activation so as to yield a pattern of hidden unit activation $P$ which falls within a cluster appropriate to 'believing that the pub has Coopers'. And the discrete causal potency of that belief may be the power of that class of hidden unit activation states to cause a distinctive kind of output. So we have long-standing states and a degree of causal discretion. But what has causal discretion is not the long-standing state but the state of activation to which it gives rise.\n","\n","Someone might, I suppose, worry that being in a certain cluster cannot, properly speaking, be a cause. Thus, they might insist that what actually does the causing must always be a particular hidden unit activation pattern and hence that, if we have to appeal to clusterings of such patterns to find analogues for semantic items, the semantic items cannot figure in the real causal story.\n","\n","But this is surely a dangerous move. For it places the philosophical feet on a slippery slope to physics worship (and fundamental physics worship at that). And this is radically revisionary. Chemistry, for example, is generally regarded as a respectable special science, and yet it is concerned to group different physical structures as instances of chemical types and to define causal laws which apply to those types. So unless the sceptic is willing is give up the causal efficacy of chemical properties too, he or she would be unwise to object to the very idea of higher-level constructs figuring in genuine causal claims.\n","\n","In general, then, it seems as if the invocation of higher-level descriptions of hidden unit activity patterns may provide for the kind of causal discretion RS\\&G require. There is, however, a class of cases (invoked in a dialectic towards the end of Chapter 8 ), which may still look problematic. These are the cases (call them lemma-belief cases) where a particular belief is said to cause a particular belief, which in turn causes an action.\n","\n","The trouble here is simple. Our account provides a single locus of discrete, causally-active belief states, viz. the locus consisting of a hidden unit activation pattern. But in some cases we seem to want two (or more) such loci. Thus consider the case of Clouseau who has the long-standing beliefs (dispositionally analysed) $p \\rightarrow q, q \\rightarrow s$ $p \\rightarrow r, r \\rightarrow s$ and learns that $p$. Suppose we want to say of Clouseau that:\\\\\n","(a) he infers $s$ using only the $q$-information; and\\\\\n","(b) his belief that $s$ then causes him to perform an action $A$.\n","\n","It now looks as if the hidden unit states resulting from input $p$ need to fall simultaneously into the $q$-cluster and the $s$-cluster variety. But the network cannot be in both states at once.\n","\n","The answer here is to introduce a notion of recurrency. A recurrent network is one which can cycle an output state back as an input state and continue processing. Now any good model of the belief system must allow that belief can play two roles. One is to mediate between perception and action. The other is to mediate between belief and belief. This means that the output states and input states must be capable of taking belief states as data too. In which case the answer to the single locus worry is to invoke a single locus used twice in a serial process. Thus in the Clouseau case we would have input $p$ yielding hidden unit activation falling into the $q$-cluster sector, which causes output meaning that $q$. This is then cycled back as input which yields activation falling into the $s$-sector and causing action $A$.\n","\n","In sum, it seems that, contrary to the eliminativists' conditional argument, distributed sub-symbolic models can allow for individual beliefs to be discretely active  in causing behaviour and other beliefs. They can do so if we adopt the following analysis:\\\\\n","1 Long-standing states of believing that $p=$ the networks disposition, given apt input, to produce hidden unit activation states falling into a cluster  which warrants the label $p$.\\\\\n","2 Active states of believing that $p=$ patterns of hidden unit activation falling into the $p$-cluster.\\\\\n","3 Active lemma-belief states $=$ as (2) but realized in a recurrent network.\n","\n","[84]\n","\\section*{5 Semantic Facts, Consciousness and Fodor's Metaphysical Prejudice}\n","The bulk of this chapter has amounted to an unabashed empirical bet that any system complex enough to count as a believer will reveal (under some post hoc analysis) semantically clustered patterns of activation. Such reasonably complex models as we have available (e.g. NETtalk) lend support to this contention.\n","\n","But suppose I were to lose the empirical bet? Suppose that, as it happens, there is no well-motivated non-semantic level of description of the belief encoding networks which unearths a scientific kind in any way corresponding to any of the semantic kinds fixed on by beliefascriptions. Then we've got trouble. There are (as far as I can see) just three options. Either we accept eliminativism (there are no beliefs and desires), or we accept a modified eliminativism (the belief/desire classificatory scheme has value in our daily lives, but beliefs are not really causes), or we attempt some sort of radical defence in which the purely semantic shows up as genuinely causal.\n","\n","For a pure semantic fact (the fact that $F$ believes that $P$ ) to be genuinely causal it must be the case that there can be true causal explanations which cite the belief despite there being no projectible non-semantic description of the system in which some internal state turns out to be the system's belief that $P$, and to have causal powers in the usual, non-semantic way.\\\\\n","(Notice that considerations concerning the holism of belief and desire, though persuasive and important, do nothing to establish this radical possibility. We can accept that an internal state can count as the belief that $P$ only in the context of other possible beliefs (and even world states) and still insist that to have causal powers that belief requires a causally active token which is also identifiable as a token of some nonsemantic kind.)\n","\n","One philosopher who is explicitly opposed to the possibility of purely, semantic facts is Jerry Fodor. He writes:\n","\n","I'd better 'fess up to a metaphysical prejudice . . . I don't believe that there are intentional mechanisms. That is, I don't believe that contents per se determine causal roles. In consequence it's got to be possible to tell the whole story about mental causation (the whole story about the implementation of the generalizations that belief-desire psychologies articulate) without referring to the intentional properties of the mental states that such generalizations subsume. (Fodor, 1987 p. 139)\n","\n","Such opposition seems plausible (a display of solid, materialist common sense) at least until we reflect that the semantic (intentional) properties of some mental states seem to have their causal powers in virtue of entering into our conscious awareness. Thus, often enough I perform some action consequent upon rehearsing a reason 'in my head'. The idea I wish to flirt with is then this: that beings capable of the conscious rehearsal of reasons have available a resource (viz. that conscious rehearsal) which can allow for the discrete causal efficacy of beliefs regardless of any stories about the underlying mode of storage and retrieval of data. Dualists (to take an extreme case) could hold both that spirit is undifferentiated and that individual consciously rehearsed beliefs are discrete causes of actions! In short, what makes it the case that my belief that $P$ caused action $A$ might be that it was my consciousness of $P$, however realized, that led to my $A$-ing.\n","\n","Likewise, regarding the issue of psychological kinds, a friend of consciousness might say that the commonality between all the variously constituted believers that $P$ just consists in the fact that an otherwise wild disjunction of physical constitutions all share the property of presenting the world to the beings concerned as being $P$-ish.\n","\n","The appeal to consciousness threatens, however, to overvalue our conscious claims about our own reasons for acting. We do not want to find ourselves forced to say that the alcoholic, who sincerely insists that she went into the pub purely on the basis of her belief about the fire, is thereby right. I do not know how to deal with cases of self-deception. A second reason for being dissatisfied with the appeal to consciousness is that it will not do if we seek causal discretion for belief contents which are not consciously rehearsed.\n","\n","What should NOT incline us to reject the account, surprisingly, is any bed-rock commitment to a materialistic worldview. For we may grant that conscious contents can provide a locus of causal discretion while still expecting, from a mature cognitive science, an account of how conscious awareness of reasons is possible. The materialistic account of the causal discretion of reasons may thus rest on an explanatory dog-leg. But this is hardly tantamount to giving up on materialism itself.\n","\n","The attraction of the invocation of consciousness is that it rules out eliminativism at a stroke. But the drawbacks are still considerable. It feels deeply unexplanatory; it does not account for the causal discretion of non-conscious contentful states; it seems impotent in the face of selfdeception. But the only other sure-fire way of ruling out eliminativism is (as Martin Davies, 1991, likes to. remind us) to endorse some form of behaviourism. This option often seems less attractive than the eliminativism it is meant to exorcize.\n","\n","[85]\n","\\subsection*{1.1 The false presupposition}\n","In this passage, Ramsey, Stich and Garon (chapter 8, henceforth RS\\&G) make a pivotal claim, in terms they credit to Jerry Fodor. Lurking within is a false presupposition which is embraced by proponents of two opposite viewpoints on the relation of Connectionist to Classical psychology - by RS\\&G, endorsing eliminativism, and by Fodor and Pylyshyn (F\\&P, chapter 3), endorsing implementationalism. When the false presupposition is exposed and pursued in the context of RS\\&G's argument, the result is evidence for neither extreme view, but rather for a more complex and interesting position.\n","\n","The mistaken presupposition in the passage from RS\\&G is revealed in the phrases 'projectable features . . . describable in the language of Connectionist theory'; 'not a genuine kind ... but a chaotically disjunctive set'; not a 'natural kind' in. 'Connectionist psychology'. At least to someone who has been actively involved for years in the effort to construct referents worthy of the names 'Connectionist theory' and 'Connectionist psychology', to penetrate the mysterious workings of connectionist networks and uncover their 'projectable features', to design more sophisticated networks embodying more cognitively powerful and relevant 'natural kinds' - at least to such a reader, it comes rather as a shock to hear that one can already presuppose such notions, that one can simply display a connectionist network and presume to immediately glean from its surface the notions Connectionist theory does and doesn't provide to Connectionist psychology. Even a casual acquaintance with the connectionist literature must raise the worry that such a presupposition might be rather a dangerous one. As RS\\&G themselves urge: 'it is early days yet' (p. 312) - not just for the empirical discipline of Connectionist psychology, but also for the formal theory of connectionist computation.\n","\n","Indeed, RS\\&G themselves identify my line of objection:\\\\\n","Objection (2): Our models do not really violate the principle of propositional modularity, since the propositions the system has learned are coded in functionally discrete ways, though this may not be obvious.\n","\n","We've heard this objection elaborated along three quite different lines. The first line - let's call it Objection (2a) - notes that functionally discrete coding may often be very hard to notice, and cannot be expected to be visible on casual inspection...\n","\n","Reply (2a): It is a bit difficult to come to grips with this objection, since what the critic is proposing is that in models like those we have constructed there might be some covert functionally discrete system of propositional encoding that has yet to be discovered. In response to this we must concede that indeed there might. We certainly have no argument that even comes close to demonstrating that the discovery of such a covert functionally discrete encoding is impossible. Moreover, we concede that if such a covert system were discovered, then our argument would be seriously undermined. (chapter 8, p. 33)\n","\n","Indeed, the point of this chapter is precisely to show explicitly that not only does such a 'covert' system of encoding exist - it is in fact just what is required to explain the behavior of the kind of networks that RS\\&G consider. In order to uncover this covert system, we need to take due mathematical consideration of the following central principle (Smolensky, 1986, and chapter 2 of this volume), which will be invoked frequently in this paper:\n","\n","Semantic level principle: Semantically interpretable aspects of distributed connectionist models reside at the higher level defined by activation patterns or vectors, and weight vectors - not at the lower level of individual units and connections. That is, semantic elements are non-local: individual semantic elements are defined over shared, spatially distributed, regions of the network.\n","\n","In this chapter, I will show how, when this principle is applied to the network on which RS\\&G base their case, a 'covert' knowledge representation system emerges. I will argue, with Objection (2), that while it is not at all obvious from staring at individual units and connections, analyzing these networks at the higher level of activation and weight vectors leads to a Connectionist version of the notion of belief. And this notion has some, but not all, of the critical properties of propositional modularity which RS\\&G argue are just the features of folk psychological beliefs that render them targets for elimination by Connectionist psychology. (This notion can in fact be viewed as a specific formalization of an idea which RS\\&G articulate as Objection (2c): Connectionist beliefs are dispositions to produce activation patterns.)\n","\n","The semantic level principle asserts that semantic notions in connectionist networks are abstract notions that must be formulated in terms of activation and weight vectors. The Connectionist notion of belief we will develop exemplifies this principle nicely. In its first formalization, C-belief, a Connectionist belief will be specified by a region within the space of weight vectors: a network holds a C-belief if its weight vector lies in that region. Whether a network holds a particular C-belief is, in general, dependent on all the individual weights in the network: on the entire weight vector. Different C-beliefs reside in the same vector of weights. In the second formalization, $L-$ belief, one particular weight vector in the region defining a C-belief is singled out; a network holding this L-belief has this particular vector as one of the components of that network's weight vector. Both the notions of C-belief and L-belief possess one of RS\\&G's crucial properties of propositional modularity: functional discreteness. Different C- or Lbeliefs have discrete identities - not in the sense of being physically localized to different parts of the network, but in the sense of being discretely identifiable and combinable in the more abstract space of weight vectors where semantically interpretable elements must be sought, according to the semantic level principle. On the other hand, C- and Lbeliefs do not individually play the kind of casual role that their Classical counterparts do.\n","\n","Pressure to develop Connectionist theoretical constructs to do at least some of the work of Classical beliefs also stems from another objection to RS\\&G's argument, one which they curiously don't address. RS\\&G's claim is that if a class of connectionist models is correct, then they constitute an ontologically radical theory shift in which folk psychological belief is eliminated. But eliminated in favor of what? The parade examples of eliminativism are cases where a notion such as caloric was eliminated in favor of a much richer and more formally elaborated set of concepts such as those of the kinetic theory of heat. With such admirable scientific progress as our guiding inspiration, we are led to expect that the primitive notion of folk psychological belief is to be eliminated in favor of a rich and formally elaborated set of concepts, concepts providing a more adequate explanation of basically the same problems that were formerly solved by Granny's humble folk psychology. These new concepts define the 'projectable features of Connectionist theory' and the 'natural kinds of Connectionist psychology'. Where are they? They are certainly not easily found in RS\\&G, and, I maintain, for very good reason - by and large, such concepts are only now being developed. Presumably, to Fodor, 'Connectionist psychology' co-refers with 'Humean associationism', and the projectable features of Connectionist theory are basically those recognized by Hume. This is not the image of glorious scientific progress evoked by the parade examples for eliminativism. So presumably RS\\&G envision some other concepts embodied in connectionist psychology. RS\\&G don't say what these concepts are, just what they are not: folk psychological beliefs, as characterized by the properties of propositional modularity.\n","\n","My reply takes as its starting point not the shared presupposition of RS\\&G and Fodor - that we know what the projectible predicates of Connectionist theory are - but precisely its negation. In effect, I ask not what Connectionist theory can do for (to?) belief, but what belief can do for Connectionist theory. At least in the class of networks RS\\&G consider, I show that Connectionist theory requires a concept like belief, and that indeed such a concept can be constructed using existing theory.\n","\n","What's at stake in this argument is the nature of the relation between the connectionist and classical cognitive architectures. If RS\\&G's argument were correct, the results, as they point out (p.312), would be (a) that proponents of the cognitive architecture represented by the connectionist models RS\\&G consider should accept the eliminativist conclusion, at least as regards Classical belief, and (b) that those who find such an eliminativist conclusion untenable should reject this connectionist cognitive architecture and accept instead, for example, the implementationalist conclusion that the only viable connectionist architecture is one which implements the classical architecture.\n","\n","However, the particular way that RS\\&G's argument will be shown to fail will lead to quite a different conclusion. Both the eliminativist and implementationalist conclusions will turn out to be unwarranted. Contra RS\\&G-style eliminativism, the concept of Connectionist belief we will construct will share several important properties of propositional modularity with its folk psychological cousin, and the theory shift is therefore not ontologically radical in the sense claimed by RS\\&G. Contra implementationalism, the Connectionist notion of belief will differ none the less in important ways from its Classical relative. Contra both eliminativism and implementationalism, the result will be that, by taking seriously a Classical notion, we actually advance connectionist theory - and at the same time, connectionist theory substantially revises that Classical notion. And when the relation between the connectionist and Classical notion of belief is examined in more detail, the relation between the connectionist and classical cognitive architecture which is exemplified will turn out to be the intermediate position between eliminativism and implementationalism proposed as 'The Proper Treatment of Connectionism' in chapter 2, adding new support for recent developments in that theoretical framework.\n","\n","RS\\&G's argument resides in the philosophy of (cognitive) science; it purports to analyze the nature of a shift from folk psychological to Connectionist theory. Thus it should come as no surprise that the central concern in this chapter is with the actual content of Connectionist theory. The overarching fact is that developing a satisfactory theory of connectionist computation is extremely difficult, and while some progress has been made, such a theory still seems far off. Thus, for most kinds of connectionist networks, it is impossible to determine how Connectionist theory relates to Classical theory, simply because the theory of that kind of network is so weak. So it becomes critical what kind of connectionist model we choose to base our assessment of RS\\&G on. If we choose state-of-the-art connectionist cognitive models, the theory is so underdeveloped that no conclusions are possible. In order to have anything interesting to say, we must turn to simpler models where there is at least some existing theory. This would appear to be the spirit in which RS\\&G chose their model, although their argument is in fact oblivious to what Connectionist theory actually has to say concerning their model. As we will see, their model falls on the current frontier of network theory, and to the extent that the theory exists, it would seem to argue the incorrectness of RS\\&G's conclusions.\n","\n","For a more definitive result, I prefer to focus on a model slightly simpler than RS\\&G's, a kind of network for which the theory is now quite complete. There, where we actually have a Connectionist theory on which to test RS\\&G's analysis, we can clearly identify its failures. Whether the conclusions based on Connectionist theory that actually exists are likely to survive in the face of future developments in Connectionist theory is a subject of speculation taken up in the conclusion (section 5).\n","\n","[86]\n","\\subsection*{1.2 Plan of the chapter}\n","RS\\&G's argument hinges on a connectionist model which I'll call RSGnet. In my reply, I will study a simplification of RSGnet called $R S G n e t_{0}$, defined in section 3. My reply depends crucially on explaining the behavior of networks like RSGnet; developing the necessary explanatory notions of $C$-belief and $L$-belief is much more straightforward for the simplified network RSGnet ${ }_{0}$. The Appendix explicitly analyses the original RSGnet, showing how to apply the notions of Cand L-belief in explaining the more complex network (a complete explanation is not carried out, and is probably not possible until further progress has been made in Connectionist theory).\n","\n","My argument develops as follows; each claim is labelled by the number of the section where it is presented:\\\\\n","2 Connectionist explanation requires some technical notion to do the work of belief. Two strategies exist for deriving such a notion: weight analysis and learning analysis.\\\\\n","3 Pursuing these two strategies within Connectionist theory, through analysis of the simplified network RSGnet $_{0}$, leads to derivation of two Connectionist formalizations of the notion of belief: C-belief and L-belief.\\\\\n","4 C- and L-beliefs possess some, but not all, of RS\\&G's properties of propositional modularity.\\\\\n","5 Conclusion: C- and L-beliefs show that RS\\&G have actually set up an argument supporting the 'proper treatment of connectionism', not eliminativism or implementationalism.\\\\\n","6 P.S. 1, response to a worry: It is legitimate to replace RSGnet by RSGnet $_{0}$; RSGnet $_{0}$ is just as valid as RSGnet as an illustration of RS\\&G's class of connectionist models.\\\\\n","7 P.S. 2, Appendix: C- and L-beliefs also play important roles in explaining RSGnet, although current theory may not suffice to fully explain RSGnet.\n","\n","[91]\n","\\section*{4 C-beliefs and Propositional Modularity}\n","We now move on to the crucial question: do the notions of C - and L belief possess any of the three properties of propositional modularity which RS\\&G claim make Classical belief a target for elimination by the PTC form of connectionism? Let's consider these three properties in turn.\n","\n","Semantic interpretability\n","Clearly both C-beliefs and L-beliefs involve semantic interpretation. The fundamental principle driving the analysis we have developed is the semantic level principle, which asserts that semantically interpretable aspects of connectionist netporks lie at the higher level of activation and weight vectors, and not at the lower level of individual units and connections. To make claims about semantic properties of connectionist networks based on staring at individual units and connections is to make a fundamental category error. In the absence of something like weight and learning analysis, carried out at the vector level - in the absence of some understanding of what is going on at this higher level of description - no sound claims about any semantic properties are possible. But concepts such as C- and L-beliefs, and others that reside at the higher level, do exist, and do make it possible to explain the behaviors of connectionist networks in semantically interpretable terms.\n","\n","Functional discreteness\n","RS\\&G's discussion of functional discreteness centers on the relation between their Network A - successfully trained on a set of 16 propositions - and Network B - successfully trained on this same set with an additional 17th proposition added. We can apply the notions of C- and L-beliefs to understand the relation between Net A and Net B, which are analogous to RS\\&G's except the network architecture is that of RSGnet $_{0}$ rather than that of RSGnet. The C-beliefs of Net B include the 17 it was trained on, 16 of which are also held by Net $A$. That means the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}_{B}$ of Net B must lie in a solution space $S_{B}$ that is smaller than the solution space $S_{A}$ containing $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}}: S_{A}$ is defined as the intersection of 16 half-spaces, while $S_{B}$ is the intersection of these 16 with an additional 17th half-space. Despite the fact that the C-beliefs are not physically localizable to different spatial sub-regions of the networks, there is none the less a more abstract but perfectly welldefined sense in which the 17 beliefs are functionally discrete: the projectable predicates in terms of which we describe the knowledgeencoding vectors $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}} / \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are just the $16 / 17 \\mathrm{C}$-beliefs. The sensible thing to say about these nets, as far as actual Connectionist theory is concerned, is precisely that there is a particular additional C-belief in the second net as compared to the first. Furthermore, if some process were to disturb the weight vector $w_{\\mathrm{B}}$, so that it moved out of the solution space $S_{B}$ while still remaining within the larger solution space $S_{A}$, it would make perfectly good sense to say that the second net had 'lost' or 'forgotten' the 17 th belief, while retaining the other 16 . The sensibleness of talking of one belief coming or going independently of others is the focus of RS\\&G's characterization of functional discreteness (chapter 8, p. 316).\n","\n","Functional discreteness can be seen via L-beliefs as well, although greater caution is required. For, assuming Nets A and B to have been trained according to (7), their weight vectors $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathbf{A}}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are given by (6) as:\n","\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","& \\mathrm{A} \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\mathbf{p}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\mathbf{q}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\mathbf{r}^{*}+\\ldots  \\tag{11} & \\mathrm{B} \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathbf{B}}=\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\mathbf{p}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\mathbf{q}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\mathbf{r}^{*}+\\ldots+\\operatorname{tr}(z) \\mathbf{z}^{*}\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","\n","where $z$ is the extra (17th) proposition on which Net $B$ is trained. It is important to remember that the * operation depends on the training set, so that in fact the vector denoted $\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ in (11A) and that denoted $\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ in (11B) are, in general, somewhat different vectors.  Thus we can analyze $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ as containing 16 and 17 L-beliefs, respectively. In this case, the L-belief that $p$ has truth value $\\operatorname{tr}(p)$ is in general somewhat different in the two networks.\n","\n","Thus our excursion into basic Connectionist theory shows the falsehood of RS\\&G's crucial claim, part of which was cited in section 1 as the primary impetus behind this reply:\n","\n","The contrast between Network A and Network B enables us to make our point about the incompatibility between common-sense psychology and these sorts of connectionist models in a rather different way. We noted in section 3 that common-sense psychology treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of propositional attitudes as projectable. Thus 'believes that dogs have fur' or 'remembers that dogs have fur' will be projectable predicates in common-sense psychology. Now both Network A and Network B might serve as models for a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur; both networks store or represent the information that dogs have fur. Nor are these the only two. If we were to train up a network on the 17 propositions in table 8.1 plus a few (or minus a few) we would get yet another system which is as different from Networks A and B as these two are from each other. The moral here is that though there are indefinitely many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur just as well as Network A does, these networks have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory. From the point of view of the connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind at all, but simply a chaotically disjunctive set. Common-sense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a psychologically natural kind; Connectionist psychology does not. (chapter 8, pp. 328-9)\n","\n","Causal role\n","While C- and L-beliefs possess the first two properties of propositional modularity, the same is not true of the final property. The modular causal roles of the beliefs of folk psychology are illustrated by RS\\&G as follows: it makes sense to say (a) that a particular instance of an action taken by an agent was caused by a particular belief/desire pair and not another, even though both pairs are held by the agent and both pairs rationally entail taking the given action; (b) that a particular instance in which an agent infers a conclusion was caused by one set of beliefs and not another, even though both sets are held by the agent and both sets logically entail the given conclusion (pp. 317-18). Focusing on the most relevant case (b), we must conclude that there is no corresponding sense for $\\mathrm{RSGnet}_{0}$ that some set of relevant C-beliefs are causally implicated in an inference on a particular occasion, while another set of relevant Cbeliefs are not causally implicated on that occasion, but might be on another.\n","\n","That this property fails for RSGnet $_{0}$ is probably clearest from learning analysis. As explained in (10) above, when a proposition $x$ is presented to be judged, the net computes its judgment by superimposing its response to all the training patterns $\\pi$, each such response weighted by the similarity of $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\pi^{*}$. When this similarity is $0-$ when $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\pi^{*}=0$, i.e. when the L-belief $\\operatorname{tr}(\\pi) \\pi^{*}$ concerning $\\pi$ produces no judgment of $\\mathbf{x}$ as true or false - then the effect of the training pattern $\\pi$ on the judgment of $x$ is nil. (Thus, for example, if the truth value of $\\pi$, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\pi)$, were reversed prior to training the net, this would have no effect on the judgment of $x$.) In such a case it could be reasonably said that this L-belief is not relevant to $x$ and has no 'causal role' in the judgment of $x$. On the other hand, if the similarity of $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\pi^{*}$ is non-zero, then the L-belief about the truth value of $\\pi$ is relevant, and it plays a causal role in the net's judgment of $x$. There is no meaningful sense in which a relevant belief might play a causal role in judging $x$ on one occasion, but not another; all relevant beliefs always have the same causal role.\n","\n","[93]\n","\\subsection*{2.1 Natural kinds and 'higher levels of descriptions'}\n","In RS\\&G a pair of networks (Network A and Network B) are described, each of which responds affirmatively to an input sequence that has been stipulated to code the proposition that dogs have fur. Both of these networks, it is claimed, 'might serve as models [albeit \"tiny toy\" models] for a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur; both networks store or represent the information that dogs have fur' (chapter 8, p. 329). When we look at the weights and biases in these two networks, however, they appear to have very little in common. Moreover, it is obvious that one could construct many other networks that store the information that dogs have fur, and that those would be as different from Networks A and B as these two are from each other. The moral here is that though there are indefinitely many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur just as well as Network A does, these networks have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory. From the point of view of the connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind at all, but simply a chaotically disjunctive set. Commonsense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a natural kind; Connectionist psychology does not. (Chapter 8, p. 329)\n","\n","Clark disagrees. As he sees it, RS\\&G are being 'unduly reductionist' (p. 000) about the ways in which connectionists can characterize their kinds. There is, he claims, a 'higher level of description' (p. 347) that will unify what seems, 'at the units-and-weights level, to be a chaotic disjunction of netporks' (p.347) To illustrate the sort of higher level of description that he has in mind, Clark sketches the sort of 'post hoc' cluster analysis that Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1986) carried out on NETtalk. The crucial finding here is that, though different training runs led to versions of NETtalk that 'had very different descriptions at the units-and-weights level of analysis', it none the less 'turned out that all the versions of NETtalk yielded pretty much the same clustering profile when subjected to post hoc statistical analysis' (p. 347) 'The moral' that Clark would draw here is one we happily endorse: 'there may be higher-level descriptions which are both scientifically well grounded and which capture commonalities between networks which are invisible at the units-and-weights level of analysis' (p. 347).\n","\n","But how, exactly, is this moral relevant to RS\\&G's natural kind argument? Apparently Clark thinks that just as various versions of NETtalk yield pretty much the same clustering profile so, too, various networks that model cognitive agents who share a given belief will also manifest higher-level commonalities that are invisible at the units-andweights level of analysis. Indeed, according to Clark, the bulk of [his] chapter has amounted to an unabashed empirical bet that any system complex enough to count as a believer will reveal (under some post hoc analysis) semantically clustered patterns of activation. Such reasonably complex models as we have available (e.g. NETtalk) lend support to this contention. (chapter 9, p. 352)\n","\n","We find this a deeply puzzling passage and, we must confess, we are not at all sure what it means. But on the most charitable interpretation we can come up with, Clark's 'unabashed empirical bet' strikes us as a sure loser. Indeed, it is our contention that the sort of higher-level commonalities that Clark's argument requires aren't even there in the case of systems like NETtalk. To see the point we have to get a bit clearer about which systems are alleged to have the 'higher-level' common properties.\n","\n","One way of characterizing the relevant class of systems is behaviorally or functionally. 'NETtalk is a connectionist network trained to negotiate the domain of text-to-speech transformations. More accurately, it takes a window of text and, letter by letter, yields a coding for phonemes which is then fed into a speech synthesizer which produces the spoken sounds' (pp. 345-6). Let us use the term NETtalker for any system that can carry out the appropriate text-to-speech transformations at a suitably impressive level of accuracy. Another way to characterize the relevant class of systems is by describing their architecture. 'The network [NETtalk] itself is fairly large, comprising 309 units and 18,629 connectors. The units include 80 hidden units and 55 output units corresponding to distinct phonemes' (p. 346). We will use the term NETtalk-structure for systems that fit this description and are otherwise similar to the network described by Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1986).\n","\n","Now what Sejnowski and Rosenberg showed is that several different NET TALKERS all of which had NETtalk-structure 'yielded pretty much the same clustering profile when subjected to post hoc statistical analysis' (p. 347). On the basis of this it might be plausible to conjecture that all\n","\n","NETtalkers with a NETtalk-structure will yield much the same clustering profile. However, it is almost certainly the case that one could build lots of NETtalkers that do not have anything resembling a NETtalk-structure. One can, in all likelihood, build NETTALKers with 800 hidden units, or with 8,000 . And, as Clark notes (note 4), when they are 'trained up' using back-propagation, systems with hidden units to spare tend to find strategies very different from those invoked by systems with fewer hidden units. The Sejnowski and Rosenberg cluster analysis was restricted to systems with a NETtalk-structure. Thus it provides no reason at all to suppose that all NETtalkers, whatever their structure, will exhibit 'much the same clustering profile'. Indeed, it is far from clear that it even makes sense to compare the clustering profile of two NETtalkers with radically different structures.\n","\n","To see how all of this is relevant to RS\\&G's natural kind argument, let us return to Clark's 'unabashed empirical bet'. What Clark is betting is that 'any system complex enough to count as a believer' will manifest some higher-level commonalities with all other such systems. But now how does Clark propose to characterize the systems to which the bet applies? Plainly he doesn't want to restrict his claim to systems with structures like those of Network A and Network B, nor, for that matter, to networks with any other specific architectural features. Rather, the systems he's talking about are to be characterized behaviorally or functionally, in much the same way that the class of NETTalkers was characterized a few paragraphs back. But, as we have just seen, there is not the slightest plausibility to the suggestion that all NETtalkers exhibit similar or identical cluster profiles. And since Clark's 'bet' was based entirely on the analogy with NETtalk, it seems pretty clear that the smart money will bet against him.\\\\\n","Before leaving the natural kind argument, let us consider briefly how what we have said might apply to Smolensky's view. On what is perhaps the most natural reading, Smolensky's reply to RS\\&G's natural kind argument is rather similar to Clark's. For Smolensky, too, is urging that there are non-obvious 'higher-level' features shared by certain connectionist networks, though on casual inspection the networks appear to have little in common. The difference, of course, is that Smolensky does not rely on analogies; he explains in great detail how the putatively shared features (C-belief and L-belief) are to be defined.\n","\n","Our problem with Smolensky's argument is that we are not at all sure which systems he thinks will manifest the common features that he characterizes. To see the point, let us return to the 'unabashed empirical bet' that is at the heart of Clark's argument. What Clark is betting is that 'any system complex enough to count as a believer' that $p$ will manifest appropriate higher-level commonalities with any other system complex enough to count as a believer that $p$. And, indeed, this is exactly what is needed to rebut RS\\&G's natural kind argument. For what RS\\&G claim is that 'the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes [that $p$ ] is not a genuine natural kind at all, but simply a chaotically disjunctive set' (chapter 8, p. 329). So if Smolensky is offering a serious rebuttal to RS\\&G's argument, he must be claiming that any connectionist network that would count as a model of a cognitive agent who believes that $p$ would manifest the C-belief that $p$ or the L-belief that $p$. However, if this is what Smolensky is claiming, then by his own admission his argument does not even come close to establishing his conclusion. For surely most, if not all, of the networks that we would take seriously as models of a cognitive agent who believes that $p$ are going to be vastly more complex than either RSGnet or Smolensky's RSGnet ${ }_{0}$. And far from giving us some reason to believe that all of these models have the C- or L-belief that $p$, Smolensky concedes that he does not even know how to define C- and L-belief for these more complicated systems. Now, of course, it may be unfair to Smolensky to attribute to him the claim that all networks that would count as a model of a believer that $p$ will manifest the C- or L-belief that $p$. Certainly, he never explicitly makes such a claim. However, if he doesn't accept this claim, then it is hard to see how his sophisticated construction of C- and L-belief is at all relevant to RS\\&G's natural kind argument. RS\\&G claim that networks (all networks, of course, not some networks) that model agents who believe that $p$ 'have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory' (Chapter 8, p. 329). So if we read Smolensky as claiming only that some networks that model agents who believe that $p$ have the C - or L-belief that $p$, then he has simply failed to respond to RS\\&G's challenge.\n","\n","At one point in chapter 10, Smolensky claims that it is 'likely' that 'explanatory notions [that are] richer, more powerful and more cognitively relevant than C-and L-beliefs will emerge' from Connectionist theory. Though he quite sensibly goes on to note that '[w]hether the new notions will support the conclusions drawn here from C- and Lbeliefs is impossible to know in advance' (Chapter 10, p. 380). On the other side, RS\\&G cheerfully concede in their Reply (2a) that they have no argument demonstrating that it is impossible to discover the sort of 'covert functionally discrete . . . encoding' that folk psychology seems to require, and that 'if such a covert system were discovered, then [their] argument would be seriously undermined' (chapter 8, p. 331). So, though Smolensky's tone is perhaps a bit more optimistic than RS\\&G's, it seems to us that the difference between his position and RS\\&G's is all but indiscernible.\n","\n","[94]\n","\\subsection*{2.2 Superpositional storage and discrete causal efficacy}\n","The second argument in RS\\&G that Clark considers is the one he calls the argument from 'superpositional storage'. The essential claim in that argument is that, in networks like A and B , in which information 'is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network ... [It] makes no sense to ask whether or not the representation of a particular proposition plays a causal role in the network's computation' (Chapter 8, p. 327). By contrast, common-sense psychology assumes that it typically does makes sense to ask whether a given belief played a role in a certain cognitive episode, or whether it was causally inactive in that episode. Moreover, common sense recognizes that in some cases '[a]n agent may have two long-standing beliefs which are both equipotent (both apt to cause the same piece of behaviour on a given occasion) AND YET the agent may as a matter of fact act on the basis of only one of the two beliefs' (Clark, chapter 9, p. 345). Clark labels this latter thesis the 'Equipotency claim'.\n","\n","In responding to RS\\&G's argument, Clark's first move is to propose that we identify a belief with a certain pattern of hidden unit activation. If we do this, there will be no problem in saying whether or not a given belief plays a causal role in a particular computation that the network performs. But, as Clark goes on to note, this proposal was anticipated in RS\\&G, and criticized on the grounds that having a certain belief is typically a long-standing feature of a system, while being in a certain activation state is not an enduring state of the network.\n","\n","Very well, Clark continues, '[s]uppose we accept this. The next obvious move is to suggest that we might identify the belief not with the transient activation pattern but with the long-standing disposition to produce that activation pattern in a given circumstance' (p. 350.) But, as Clark reports, this move, too was anticipated and criticized RS\\&G.\n","\n","The trouble is, of course, that it is not obvious that the various dispositions said to correspond to various beliefs are sufficiently extricable from one another, qua subvening states of the system, to count as the 'discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires'. (p. 350) 'But', Clark continues, this just muddies the waters unnecessarily. Beliefs need to be longstanding states, yes. And a belief-in-action needs to be capable of having a functionally discrete realization, yes. But the folk are nowhere committed to the view that the belief-in-action and the long-standing belief must be physically identical. The long-standing stored state may be the disposition [to produce an appropriate pattern of hidden unit activation]. And the discrete causal potency of that belief may be the power of that class of hidden unit activation states to cause a distinctive kind of output. (p. 350)\n","\n","On our view, there are two rather different problems with this reply. First, the interpretation of the propositional modularity assumption that is implicit in the reply is much too weak; indeed, it is so weak that it renders the assumption completely trivial. For, on the interpretation of propositional modularity that Clark's argument requires, no deterministic system that stores propositional information could fail to satisfy propositional modularity. If this is right, there is nothing at all we could learn about the workings of such a system that would show that it violates propositional modularity. Secondly, as Clark himself concedes, his suggestion does not really address the problem posed by equipotency unless it is supplemented with an assumption about recurrency. But that assumption leads to models of cognitive activity that are both bizarre and unworkable. We'll elaborate on each of these problems in turn.\n","\n","Imagine that you are given a black box which behaves just the way that RS\\&G's Network A does. Given any of the 16 coded sentences in table $8-1$ of RS\\&G, it answers yes or no, and the answers are the same as the ones Network A would produce. Suppose further that we know the black box is a deterministic device: it responds the same way each time it is given an input of a particular type. Beyond this, we will assume we know nothing at all about how the device works.\n","\n","Let's now ask whether the device respects the principle of propositional modularity. On Clark's interpretation of the principle, it would seem that the answer must be yes. For, every time the black box is given a particular input, it produces the same output. And there must be some pattern of internal states - simple or complex - which the system goes through in getting from the input to the output. So, following Clark, we can identify the 'belief-in-action' with this pattern of internal states, whatever it may be. Of course, this pattern is a transient state, not an enduring state of the system. So if we are looking for long-standing beliefs, it is not a good candidate. But this needn't worry us. For the system must have a long-standing disposition to produce the 'belief-inaction' pattern, and we can identify that disposition with the longstanding belief. Of course, the 'belief-in-action' is a very different state of the system from the long-standing belief. But, according to Clark, that's just fine. There is no need for the two to be identical. So it looks like our black box satisfies propositional modularity, as Clark would interpret it. And, since we know nothing about the box except that it is a deterministic device that responds appropriately, it looks like any deterministic device that can respond appropriately to various coded sentences must represent them in a propositionally modular fashion. On Clark's reading of propositional modularity, anything that behaves like a believer really is one.\n","\n","Now we can imagine an opponent who would be quite happy with this result. The opponent we are imagining contends that common-sense psychology makes no really substantive claims about the mechanisms underlying behavior. There are passages in Dennett's work which appear to endorse such a view (see, for example, Dennett, 1987), and Jackson and Pettit (1990) also seem to flirt with this sort of neobehaviorist account of belief. But this would be an odd position for Clark to endorse. A central theme in Clark's work is that if the scientific account of the mechanisms underlying behavior turn out to conflict with the common-sense account, 'then we've got trouble' (p.352) since the eliminativist will have won the day. Since Clark is prepared to take this eliminativist threat seriously, he can't adopt the toothless interpretation of propositional modularity that his reply to RS\\&G requires. For, on that interpretation, any deterministic system that behaves like a believer automatically satisfies propositional modularity, and there is no possibility that a scientific account of the mechanisms underlying that behavior will conflict with propositional modularity.\n","\n","Let's turn, now, to Clark's discussion of the equipotency problem. In the case sketched by RS\\&G, Clouseau has two long-standing beliefs each of which might contribute to his inference that the butler is lying. On Clark's proposal, both of these long-standing beliefs are dispositions of the belief-storage system. So how are we to tell which of them contributed to the inference? Clark's answer appeals to the notion of recurrence. In order to play a role in an inference, the dispositional state must first produce a hidden activation pattern, which causes an output; that output is 'then cycled back as input' to the storage system, which then yields the conclusion about the butler as a second output.\n","\n","Perhaps the first thing to say about this proposal is that it hardly seems in the spirit of connectionism, since it ignores what ardent connectionists see as one of the most important virtues of their models: the capacity to simultaneously make use of a large number of facts or constraints. On Clark's account of inference, by contrast, each intermediate step in an inference must be individually activated and then cycled back as a premise in a new computational cycle.\n","\n","But this is the least of the problems with Clark's proposal. A much more serious problem is that the idea just won't work when the logical forms of the conditionals involved in the inference are a bit more complex. Suppose, for example, that Clouseau has long-standing beliefs of the form:\n","\n","If $p^{*}$ then $p$\\\\\n","If $q^{*}$ then $q$ and\\\\\n","If $p \\& q$ then $s$\\\\\n","Now suppose he is informed that $p^{*}$. After a brief delay during which he may think about other matters, he is informed that $q^{*}$. How is he supposed to get to s? Well, as Clark tells the story, when he learns that $p^{*}$, he outputs $p$. At this point he might recycle $p$ into the system. But it wouldn't produce $s$. Now $q^{*}$ comes along. The system outputs $q$. Feeding this back as input won't yield $s$ either. As far as we can see, there is no way for the system that Clark sketches to get from $p^{*}$ and $q^{*}$ to $s$. So, far from having the resources to handle cases of equipotence, the sort of system Clark proposes does not even have the capacity to handle simple inferences.\n","\n","[96]\n","\\subsection*{3.2 Eliminativism and 'constitutive' properties}\n","In some of the literature in this area there are hints of a rather different strategy for filling the gap in the eliminativist argument. Rather than relying on the description theory of reference, this strategy invokes the notion of a conceptually necessary or 'constitutive' property. The basic idea is that some of our concepts require, as a matter of logical or conceptual necessity, that any object to which the concept applies must have certain properties. These properties are 'constitutive' of the concept. We would not apply the concept to an object, or count the object as falling within the category that the concept specifies, unless the object has the constitutive properties. Thus, for example, it might be urged that being unmarried and being male are constitutive properties for the concept of a bachelor, or that having a negative charge is constitutive for the concept of an electron. If something is not male and unmarried, we just would not classify it as a bachelor; if something does not have a negative charge, it would not count as an electron.\n","\n","It is relatively easy to see how the notion of a constitutive property might be used to fill the logical gap in eliminativist arguments. If it can be shown that a certain property is constitutive for having propositional attitudes, then if science (or philosophical argument) can demonstrate that no one has that property, it follows that the no one has propositional attitudes. Thus, for example, if having propositionally modular psychological states is constitutive for having beliefs and desires, then if people do not have propositionally modular psychological states, then they do not have beliefs and desires. We are not at all sure that anyone really construes eliminativist arguments in this way, though there are a number of authors who sometimes write as though they take quite seriously the idea that certain properties are constitutive of the concept of belief, thus inviting this sort of eliminativist argument (see, for example, Evans, 1982, pp. 65, 104; Clark, 1989, pp. 146-50; 1991a, b, s.II; Davies, 1991, p. 239ff). The closer one gets to Oxford, the more fashionable this talk of 'constitutive' properties becomes. But if it is not clear that anyone actually interprets eliminativism in this way, it is clear that this strategy for filling the gap in the eliminativist argument faces some daunting difficulties.\n","\n","The first difficulty is making a case for the claim that one or another property is in fact constitutive for having propositional attitudes. Thus, for example, the mere fact (if indeed it is a fact) that lots of people think or presuppose that beliefs are propositionally modular is surely not enough to establish that propositional modularity is constitutive for having beliefs. Nor would it be enough to show that many people would refuse to apply the term 'belief' to any state which is not propositionally modular. For it might simply be the case that most people (or indeed all people) happen to have some strongly held opinions about propositional attitudes, and that these opinions are false. There was, after all, a time at which most people would have refused to apply the term 'star' to an object that did not rotate around the earth. As we now know, they had some deeply entrenched false opinions about stars.\n","\n","For those familiar with central themes in the philosophy of language during the past four decades, this first difficulty suggests a second. The whole idea of constitutive or conceptually necessary properties seems to presuppose that we can draw a distinction between analytic sentences (roughly those that are 'true in virtue of their meaning alone') and synthetic sentences (roughly those whose truth or falsity depends, in part, on the way the world is). If being unmarried is constitutive for being a bachelor, then presumably 'All bachelors are unmarried' is analytic. And if being propositionally modular is constitutive for being a belief, then 'All beliefs are propositionally modular' is analytic as well. But, of course, Quine and others have offered some enormously influential arguments aimed at showing that there is no analytic/ synthetic distinction to be drawn (see, for example, Quine, 1953; Harman, 1967). There are no sentences which are true solely in virtue of their meaning. If this is right then there are no constitutive or conceptually necessary properties.\n","\n","We don't propose to review the arguments against the existence of the analytic/synthetic distinction. Indeed, for current purposes we need not even assume that the conclusion of those arguments is correct. All that is needed for current purposes is the observation that the very existence of analytic truths and thus of constitutive or conceptually necessary properties is hotly disputed and highly problematic. Those who want to fill the logical gap in the eliminativist argument by invoking the idea of constitutive properties owe us some further argument. They must, at least, make it plausible that the arguments against the analytic/ synthetic distinction are mistaken, and that the notion of constitutive properties is defensible. If there are philosophers who choose to follow this path, we wish them well. But we don't propose to hold our breath until they succeed.\n","\n","[97]\n","\\subsection*{1.1 A Commitment of Common Sense Psychology.}\n","RSG base their main argument on three commitments of common sense psychology concerning propositional attitudes: propositional attitudes are semantically interpretable; they have a causal role; and they are functionally discrete. RSG call this cluster of features propositional modularity (504). The first two are familiar. Propositional attitudes are the sorts of things that can be true or false, satisfied or unsatisfied, and the like; in the current term of art, they have content. And propositional attitudes influence behavior, belief fixation, etc. in ways that are appropriate to their content. To say that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete is to say that they can have effects singly (or in contentbased structures, as when a conclusion is drawn from two premises, with no other propositions playing a role). RSG hold that distributed connectionist models do not satisfy the common sense demand for functionally discrete states because in such models all information is encoded holistically-hence inseparablythroughout the network.\n","\n","They mention two different ways in which common sense propositional attitudes are functionally discrete. First, they can be acquired or lost individually (nearly enough). For example, \"Henry...had completely forgotten that the car keys were hidden in the refrigerator,\" (504-5) although he had forgotten nothing else. And if you are told that the keys are in the refrigerator, you will acquire a small cluster of new beliefs, but most of your beliefs will be not be altered.\n","\n","The second kind of functional discreteness is more important in the argument. Sometimes a person has a total set of beliefs and desires that provide more than one reason for performing an action, A. And sometimes it happens that the person does A for one of those reasons, with the other possible reason not figuring in the etiology of the action at all. Likewise, sometimes a person has several sets of beliefs that could lead her to infer a particular new belief, $p$, and she infers p from one of those sets, with the others not figuring in her thinking at all. Thus, according to common sense psychology, it is a determinate question which potential reasons for an action or change in belief were the actual or operative reasons.\n","\n","According to common sense psychology, then, the same state is semantically evaluable and has a content-appropriate, functionally discrete, causal role. Such states have what RSG call propositional modularity. Functional discreteness is the feature on which the argument turns. Since semantic evaluability and some kind of causal role are taken for granted for the most part, we will usually speak of functional discreteness, reserving 'propositional modularity' for contexts in which semantic evaluability (or causal role) might be an issue.\n","\n","[98]\n","\\subsection*{1.2 A Class of Connectionist Models.}\n","RSG claim that distributed connectionism must deny propositional modularity. They characterize a class of connectionist models, which, they claim, are incompatible with propositional modularity, in particular with functional discreteness of semantically evaluable states. The models in this class are characterized by three properties:\\\\\n","i. Their encoding of information in the connection weights and in the biases on units is highly distributed rather than localist.\\\\\n","ii. Individual hidden units in the network have no comfortable symbolic interpretation; they are subsymbolic....\\\\\n","iii. The models are intended as cognitive, not merely as implementations of cognitive models. (p. 508)\n","\n","Features (i) and (ii) are meant to insure that it is not possible to associate specific information with particular local parts of the model. Connections and nodes are not to be semantically evaluable individually or in small sets. Information in the model is encoded holistically throughout the network or throughout large portions of the network. Furthermore, each node contributes to representing many different propositions, and each connection weight contributes to storing many different propositions. Thus, information is contained in the network holistically and globally, not locally. And this means, RSG argue, that all of the information in the network is involved in all of its processing, so that it is not possible to single out certain bits of information as operative-and others as inoperative-in a token process, as folk psychology requires.\n","\n","As RSG note, feature (iii) is not about the network as such, but about how it is to be interpreted. The idea is that the model is supposed to tell us something about how the mind works, not how it might be embodied. Consider, for instance, a classical parser-a classical computer program which is meant to take natural language sentences as input and yield structural descriptions of the input sentences as output. Such a program can be considered a hypothesis about the cognitive processes, knowledge structures, and so forth, involved in recognizing the grammatical structure of sentences. The program can be run on many different computers, with different machine languages; the hypothesis about cognition is the same in each case. The machine language of the computer that the program happens to be running on is irrelevant to the cognitive story the program proposes.\n","\n","One could attempt to use a connectionist network to implement the operation of such a classical program. This would be to attempt to use the network as an implementation of the classical model-as an alternative, unorthodox kind of machine language. There would still be no difference in the hypotheses put forward about cognition. This is the kind of construal of connectionist models that (iii) rules out.\n","\n","But a connectionist model-for instance, a parsing model such as Berg (1992)-can also be construed as offering an alternative story about the cognitive processes involved in recognizing the grammatical structure of sentences, a story that is in competition with the classical model. This would be to construe the model as a cognitive model, as required by (iii). When understood in this way, RSG hold, distributed connectionist models are incompatible with the propositional modularity of folk-psychological states.\n","\n","[99]\n","\\section*{RSG observe that}\n","[t]he information encoded in Network A is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network. Whenever information is extracted from Network A, by giving it an input string and seeing whether it computes a high or a low value for the output unit, many connection strengths, many biases and many hidden units play a role in the computation. And any particular weight or unit or bias will help encode information about many different propositions. (513)\n","\n","This is certainly a correct description of the workings of the network. Whenever the truth or falsehood of a proposition (i.e., high or low output node activation) is computed from an input proposition, all of the hidden units and many of the weights are involved in the computation. RSG argue that this holistic computation is incompatible (they say, \"radically incongruent\") \"with the propo- sitional modularity of common sense psychology.\"\\\\\n","For as we saw in Section 3, common sense psychology seems to presuppose that there is generally [sic] some answer to the question of whether a particular belief or memory played a causal role in a specific cognitive episode. But if belief and memory are subserved by a connectionist network like ours, such questions seem to have no clear meaning. (513)\n","\n","[100]\n","\\section*{2. Critique of the Functional Discreteness Argument.}\n","The overall structure of our critique is as follows. We distinguish three different ways that intentional mental properties (state-types) can be possessed by a cognitive system (section 2.1). On the basis of this tripartite distinction we distinguish several different possible forms of functional discreteness; we then argue that common sense psychology is committed to only one of these forms of functional discreteness, and that common sense psychology leaves it an open empirical question whether or not any of the other forms are manifested by propositional attitudes in humans (section 2.2). With this discussion as background, we press three separate replies to RSG's argument.\n","\n","First, connectionist models, including RSG's Network A, typically exhibit the only kind of functional discreteness to which common sense psychology is committed. Thus, even if connectionism does preclude some or all of the other kinds, this fact would not generate an incompatibility with common sense psychology; rather, it would mean that connectionism answers in the negative certain empirical questions about functional discreteness that common sense psychology itself leaves open (section 2.3).\n","\n","Second, even if common sense psychology were committed to those other kinds of functional discreteness, and even if human cognition failed to exhibit them, these facts would only show that common sense psychology is somewhat mistaken about propositional attitudes; they would not show that propositional attitudes don't exist (section 2.4).\n","\n","Third, we argue that connectionism does not really preclude any of the other kinds of functional discreteness anyway. In principle, any or all of them could be manifested in a connectionist system in which information is embodied holistically and distributedly in weights and in activation patterns across nodes. Such functional discreteness normally would not involve distinct physical components of the network's causal evolution; instead it would be discernible only at a more abstract, mathematical, level of description in which the network is characterized as a high-dimensional \"dynamical system\" (section 2.5).\n","\n","[102]\n","\\subsection*{2.2 Types of Functional Discretenes, and their Status within Common Sense Psychology.}\n","With these distinctions in mind, let us reconsider common sense psychology's commitment to functional discreteness. Consider, for instance, RSG's example of Clouseau. Clouseau has heard that the hotel is closed for the season and that the train is out of service. The Butler says that he spent the night at the hotel and took the train back to town in the morning. Common sense reckons that Clouseau might have inferred that the butler is lying from his belief that the hotel is closed for the season, or from his belief that the morning train has been taken out of service, or from both. From the perspective of common sense there is-often-a determinate answer to the question which it was. RSG believe that no determinate answer to this question is possible if human cognitive systems are relevantly like their Network A.\n","\n","Why does common sense reckon this a determinate question? The first thought of the common sense psychologist is that it depends upon which relevant beliefs consciously occurred to Clouseau (and which logical connections he was aware of ). If he consciously thought of the hotel closing and consciously realized that its being closed meant that the Butler couldn't have spend the evening in the hotel, but didn't remember the train at all at the time, well-its obvious which one was operative.\n","\n","Consider also RSG's example of Alice the E-mailer. Alice had two reasons to go to her office. She wanted to talk to her research assistant, and believed that he would be at the office. And she wanted to send some E-mail messages, which she believed she could do from the office. \"Common sense psychology assumes that Alice's going to her office might have been caused by either one of the belief/desire pairs, or by both, and that determining which of these options obtains is an empirical matter.\" (p. 505) In RSG's rendition, Alice's desire to send some E-mail messages was causally inert. Why might that be? The most natural explanation is that it did not consciously occur to her in the relevant time frame while her desire to talk to her research assistant did. The relevant time frame is not, of course, just the period immediately preceding her departure for the office. She might have had a thought early in the morning which she could have expressed out loud by saying, \"Oh, I've got to talk to Fred today about....\" She might then have taken care of some household chores, read the paper, gotten ready to go to the office and departed, without Fred ever again entering her consciousness.\n","\n","Thus, the paradigmatic cases of propositional modularity recognized by common sense psychology are cases in which the causally active mental state is occurrent and conscious, whereas the causally dormant mental state is dispositional but not occurrent. That is, the type of functional discreteness to which common sense psychology is clearly committed is the following.\n","\n","\\begin{enumerate}\n","\\item S1 is occurrent; S 2 is dispositional but not occurrent.\\\\\n","(Subcase: S1 conscious/S2 unconscious)\\\\\n","(Here and below, S1 is the state that is causally active; S2 is a state that could have led to the same action or thought but did not do so in this case.)\n","\\end{enumerate}\n","\n","We will call this subcase of type 1 functional discreteness paradigmatic functional discreteness.\n","\n","Common sense also recognizes that one might make use of information that does not rise to consciousness, or arrive at a conclusion without conscious inference, especially in rapid physical activity.  Thus we should add a second subcase to type 1 functional discreteness: unconscious/unconscious.\n","\n","It is not contrary to common sense to consider possible complications of paradigmatic functional discreteness, especially in the case of explanation of actions, decisions, choices, etc. Perhaps Alice is more deeply interested in her Email conversations than she cares to admit to herself. So her \"real\" reason for going to the office is to send some E-mail messages, but she \"tells herself\" (as we might say) that she is going to the office to talk to Fred. Her desire to send E-mail messages was occurrent and causally efficacious, but she suppressed awareness of its efficacy, and perhaps of the desire itself. This seems to be a case in which both desires are tokened, but in which only one, the one that is not consciously considered, is the actual cause. Thus, common sense clearly recognizes the possibility of a second type of functional discreteness.\\\\\n","2. S1 is occurrent and S2 is occurrent.\\\\\n","(Conscious/conscious; conscious/unconscious; unconscious/conscious; unconscious/unconscious.)\n","\n","All four subcases are conceptually possible although the first is perhaps questionable from the point of view of common sense. It seems odd to suppose that Clouseau thought of the hotel closing, thought of the train being taken out of service, understood that each was incompatible with something the Butler had said, and inferred that the Butler was lying from one of these beliefs but not the other.\n","\n","Dispositional possession of an intentional state-type does not make a direct causal contribution to an outcome the state-type could cause; rather, dispositional states enter the causal fray indirectly via the exercise of the disposition, i.e., via the occurrence during processing of an occurrent token of that state-type. Case 1 involves a situation where the disposition to produce a token of S2 does not get exercised during processing, so it is, in a sense, a degenerate type of functional discreteness. It needs to be stated because it is the one case of functional discreteness to which common sense is clearly committed. Given that intentional state-types that remain merely dispositional do not play a causal role, three further cases are worth distinguishing.\\\\\n","3. S 1 is occurrent; S 2 is morphological.\\\\\n","(Conscious/unconscious; unconscious/unconscious.)\\\\\n","4. S1 is morphological; S2 is occurrent. (Unconscious/conscious; unconscious/unconscious.)\\\\\n","5. S 1 is morphological; S 2 is morphological.\n","\n","Common sense allows for the conceptual possibility of each of Cases 3 through 5 , because one can make intelligible, from the point of view of common sense, the idea that there is morphological content that has a causal role. For instance, here is the transcript of an actual conversation:\n","\n","J: The Parkers are at their place; the red flag is up on their mailbox.\\\\\n","N : Yeah, I saw their golden [retriever dog] last night.\\\\\n","J: Oh, yeah; you told me that. I forgot.\\\\\n","Clearly, J inferred the Parkers' presence from the flag, not from the dog. The flag is the thing he thought of. Had he remembered the dog, he might have realized that he did not have to tell N about the Parkers. So far, this story illustrates Type 1 functional discreteness.\n","\n","But it illustrates something more. To infer that the Parkers were home from the raised flag on their mailbox, J must rely on something like ( F ) the flag is up on the Parkers mailbox only when they are here to raise it. Likewise, when N inferred that the Parkers were home, she relied on something like (D) the Parkers' golden is here only when they are here. Thus, we have instances of (F) and (D) exhibiting functionally discrete causal roles.\n","\n","But it is quite unlikely that either (F) or (D) consciously occurred to either J or N. And, we submit, it is quite intelligible from the point of view of common sense to suppose that neither (F) nor (D) was tokened subconsciously either; indeed, that neither was tokened subconsciously seems more likely to us than not. If it was not, this is not a case of Type 1 or of Type 2 functional discreteness. If the information ( F ) that played a role in J's inference was not tokened consciously or unconsciously, then it was morphological rather than occurrent or merely dispositional.  This seems, then, to be construable by common sense as a case of Type 5 functional discreteness. So common sense evidently does permit the possibility of morphological content and Type 5 functional discreteness. (In Section 5 we offer an example construable as Type 4 functional discreteness, plus variants of RSG's Clouseau example for each of Types 2-5.)\n","\n","But our main point in this Section is that common sense is only committed to the paradigm case of functional discreteness, Type 1 functional discreteness where the causally active state is conscious. The other cases we have distinguished are recognized by common sense as possibilities, some as the quite serious possibilities.\n","\n","In Section 2.5 below, we argue that all five types of functional discreteness are possible in models that fall within the class of models characterized by RSG.\n","\n","[103]\n","\\subsection*{2.3. First Reply: Folk Psychology and Distributed Connectionism Are Compatible.}\n","The most immediate reply to RSG's functional discreteness argument is now quite straightforward. The only kind of functional discreteness to which common sense psychology is committed is paradigmatic functional discreteness. Connectionist models have no trouble at all manifesting this degenerate kind of functional discreteness. For, on one hand, the occurrent beliefs of common sense psychology correspond most naturally to certain tokened activation patterns in a connectionist network; and activation patterns have a causal influence on processing. Processing in a connectionist network is spreading activation. On the other hand, the dispositional beliefs of common sense psychology correspond most naturally to a connectionist network's dispositions to generate the activation patterns that function in the system as representation-tokens; and when such a disposition remains dormant, so that the relevant activation pattern does not get tokened during processing, then the pattern does not affect the system's processing (since it is not there). Thus, paradigmatic functional discreteness is easily accommodated within the relevant class of connectionist models: an activation pattern can occur that constitutes a token representation that causes a certain subsequent outcome, while at the same time the system has a dispositional representation which would bring about the same outcome were it activated and yet remains dormant on this particular occasion. Therefore, the connectionist models considered by RSG do not preclude the kind of functional discreteness to which common sense psychology is committed.\n","\n","In the remainder of this subsection we will amplify this reply, by discussing (i) the Network A described by RSG and their remarks about it, (ii) RSG's replies to certain objections they themselves consider, and (iii) recent remarks about RSG's modularity argument by Stich and Warfield (forthcoming).\n","\n","There are two kinds of representations in Network A. The input layer is interpreted as representing questions concerning the truth or falsity of certain propositions. And the trained up network represents answers to those questions. That is, it represents certain propositions as being true or false in the pattern of activation in the set of nodes consisting of input nodes plus the output node.\n","\n","Activation of the encoding of a proposition in the input layer causes the output node to record true or false. The occurrent representation of the proposition causes the recollection of its truth value. Potential but non-occurrent representations do not exert any such influence. Thus Network A, like connectionist models generally, exhibits paradigmatic functional discreteness: occurrent representations have an effect, whereas non-occurrent representations that the system is disposed to produce, but has not produced on a given occasion, do not have an effect.\n","\n","Of course, what RSG actually have in mind as analogues of beliefs, in Network A, are not occurrent representations in the input layer (or in the hidden layer), but rather the propositional information which is holistically embodied \"in the weights\". They argue,\n","\n","Since information is encoded in a highly distributed manner...with information regarding any given proposition scattered throughout the network, the system lacks functionally discrete, identifiable sub-structures that are semantically interpretable as representations of individual propositions. (514. $)^{5}$\n","\n","Functional discreteness does not obtain, they contend, for propositional information embodied holistically in the network's weights (and biases). Rather,\n","\n","There is a real sense in which all the information encoded in the network's connectivity matrix [weights] is causally implicated in any processing in which the network engages. (O'Brien, 1991, p. 173; quoted with endorsement by Stich, 1991, p. 180$)^{6}$\n","\n","But the common-sense psychologist can grant that all the information in the weights is implicated in any processing in which the network engages, and deny that this goes contrary to the kind of functional discreteness to which common sense psychology is committed (viz., the paradigmatic kind). Information in the weights is, if anything, the connectionist analog of morphological content. And common sense psychology simply is not committed to claiming that morphological content in humans exhibits functional discreteness. Whether it does or not is an open empirical question, as far as common sense psychology is concerned. Thus, if (some) distributed connectionist models do not have functionally discrete morphological content, that doesn't make them incompatible with common sense psychology; rather, it answers the empirical question negatively (for those models).\n","\n","RSG do discuss the objection that (i) connectionist representations are patterns of activation, and (ii) activation patterns are functionally discrete states. They reply that the identification of beliefs with activation patterns is \"singularly implausible,\" because \"in common sense psychology beliefs and propositional memories are typically of substantial duration; and they are the sorts of things that cognitive agents generally have lots of even when they are not using them\" (p. 518). But the appropriate counterreply is straightforward: it is only occurrent beliefs that are appropriately regarded, within connectionist modeling, as activation patterns.\n","\n","RSG also discuss the suggestion that \"long standing beliefs might be identified not with activation patterns, but with dispositions to produce activation patterns,\" and the related suggestion that \"the familiar philosophical distinction between dispositional and occurrent beliefs might be captured, in connectionist models, as the distinction between dispositions to produce activation patterns and activation patterns themselves\" (pp. 518-9). They reply that dispositions to produce activation patterns \"are not the discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires\" (p. 519). Once again the counterreply is straightforward: folk psychology recognizes a distinction between occurrent and dispositional belief, and is not committed to the functional discreteness of dispositional beliefs qua dispositional; it is only committed to paradigmatic functional discreteness. (Dispositions to re-create beliefs, memories, etc. are in the weights holistically. But the (recreatable) activation pattern is not in the weights when it is not active. It is nowhere. Thus, there really is no question of the functional discreteness of dispositional beliefs. It is not that all of the dispositional beliefs are directly implicated in processing; none of them are.  )\n","\n","So connectionist representations have, by and large, functionally discrete causal roles. Those representations that get activated in a process play a causal role in that process; those not activated do not. And the specific causal roles of the ones that get activated depend upon patterns of spreading activation.\n","\n","Stich and Warfield (forthcoming) reply to a similar observation by Andy Clark (1990). Clark suggests that it is only a \"belief-in-action\" (as opposed to a long-standing belief, which may be just a disposition to produce an occurrent belief-in-action) that needs to be capable of functionally discrete causal potency (p. 96). Stich and Warfield's relevant argument is that the proposal is too weak, for on the interpretation of propositional modularity..., no deterministic system that stores propositional information could fail to satisfy propositional modularity. If this is right, there is nothing at all we could learn about the workings of such a system that would show that it violates modularity and thus does not really have beliefs. (Section 2.2)\n","\n","We take 'and thus' in the last line to mean 'and for this [lack of propositional modularity] reason'. Other deep commitments of common sense psychology might be violated even if propositional modularity is not.\n","\n","Thus, the operative complaint in this passage is that, on the proposed interpretation of propositional modularity (which requires discrete causal potency only for tokened representations), no system could fail to satisfy propositional modularity, in particular, no system could fail to exhibit functional discreteness.\\\\\n","Our reply is fourfold. First, Network A is a model of a single, immediate cognitive step-in this case, rote recall. There are no representation-level intermediaries. Given that the input and output of such a one-step process are (interpreted as) representations, and that representations are entered singly, nothing could show that the system lacks Type 1 functional discreteness. The occurrent representation in the input layer is causally active. Dispositional representations-ones that could be in the input layer but are not-are not causally active.\n","\n","But second, this is surely nothing to complain about. Any cognitive process which is immediate for a system,  and which receives only one relevant input at a time must, obviously, exhibit Type 1 functional discreteness. (It does not even depend upon the system being deterministic.) This just means that the commitment of common sense psychology to functional discreteness of propositional attitudes is a very weak commitment.\n","\n","However, third, it is easy to imagine other sorts of connectionist models that might not exhibit functional discreteness for tokened representations. A model of some task that involves multiple simultaneous soft constraint satisfaction, for instance, must allow many representations to be active at once. It might often, perhaps even typically, be impossible to determine which representations were causally responsible for the solution to a problem, especially if the representations are widely distributed. Furthermore, some systems with distributed representations in which each node contributes to many different representations can have many representations active at once by superposition of representations, in which case it may be-though it need not be (cf. section 2.5 below)-impossible to separate the causal contribution of distinct representations. Thus, there may be models of these kinds, with sensible representation level interpretations that do not exhibit Type 2 functional discreteness.\n","\n","Finally, fourth, common sense psychology is not committed to Type 2 functional discreteness anyway. The only kind of functional discreteness to which it is actually committed is trivially satisfiable.\n","\n","[104]\n","\\subsection*{2.4 Second Reply: Ontologically Conservative Theory Change.}\n","Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we are wrong in claiming that common sense psychology is only committed to the kind of functional discreteness that involves a conscious occurrent belief and a non-activated dispositional belief, and that it is actually committed to some or all of the other kinds delineated in section 2.1 above. Suppose too (although we will argue against this in the next subsection) that distributed connectionist models of the sort sketched by RSG are incompatible with the further kinds of functional modularity. Do these suppositions sanction RSG's key claim, viz., \"If connectionist hypotheses of the sort we will sketch turn out to be right, so too will eliminativism about propositional attitudes\" (p.500)?\n","\n","Surely not. RSG themselves draw a distinction between \"ontologically conservative\" theory changes (which preserve the key theoretical entities posited by of an original theory while altering or replacing that theory's claims about those entities), and \"ontologically radical\" theory changes (in which the entities posited by the old theory are repudiated as well). Even if common sense psychology happens to be committed to one or more kinds of functional discreteness of Type 2 through Type 5, altering the theory by dropping this commitment would be a rather conservative change-especially since these are not paradigmatic cases of functional discreteness. Such a change would not even approach entailing that there are no beliefs.\n","\n","[105]\n","\\subsection*{2.5 Third Reply: Strong Forms of Functional Discreteness Are Not Precluded.}\n","Distributed connectionist models embody information holistically, rather than containing discrete items of propositional information in physically discrete internal states, structures, or processes. Information that is not occurrently represented is distributed throughout the network, and each part of the network contributes to storing much or all of its information. So it appears plausible that distributed connectionist models are incompatible with functional discreteness of Types 3-5. This appearance motivates RSG's argument. But the appearance is misleading, as we now briefly explain. We begin by describing a way of thinking about morphological content in connectionism. We then discuss a common phenomenon that is plausibly regarded as involving Type 4 functional discreteness-that is, a situation in which morphological content trumps occurrent content. Then we revisit Clouseau and the butler.\n","\n","The natural mathematical framework for describing connectionist networks is the body of mathematical concepts, techniques, and results known as dynamical systems theory. To describe a network as a dynamical system is to specify in a certain way its temporal evolution, both actual and hypothetical. Each node in the network is assigned a separate dimension, or axis, in a high-dimensional hyper-space; the possible activation values the node can take are points along that axis. Each possible total state of the system is thus represented by a unique point in the system's \"state space\" (in the case of connectionist networks, often called \"activation space\"). The dynamical system, as such, is essentially the full collection of temporal trajectories the network would follow through its state space-with a trajectory emanating from each point it can occupy in state space.\n","\n","The dynamical system can be thought of as a high-dimensional geometri$\\mathrm{cal} /$ topological object. A useful geometrical metaphor for dynamical systems is the notion of a landscape (in the case of networks, an activation landscape). Think of the network's n-dimensional activation space as a contoured ndimensional surface, oriented \"horizontally\" in ( $\\mathrm{n}+1$ )-dimensional space. For each point $p$, the temporal trajectory that the network itself would follow through its activation space if it were to evolve (without perturbation) from $p$ is the path \"downhill\" along the landscape that a ball would follow if positioned at $p$ and then allowed to \"roll.\"\\\\\n","Each point on the activation landscape corresponds to a total activation state of the network. Certain of these points are representation-realizing points: when the network is in the total activation state corresponding to the given point, one or more representations are tokened as activation patterns. In general, representations are multiply realizable in connectionist models. Representations are identified with activation vectors, typically with activation vectors that specify activation values for only a relatively small portion of the nodes of the network. Such a vector thus specifies values for some, but not all dimensions of activation space. All points that satisfy these values will realize the given representation.  Also, several distinct representations can, in general, be realized by a single point in activation space: the point's coordinates simultaneously satisfying the coordinate-specifications of several different vectors, each of which is identified with a distinct representation.\n","\n","From the dynamical systems point of view, cognitive-level state transitions in a connectionist network are trajectories along the activation landscape from one representation-realizing point to another. These transitions depend jointly on two interrelated factors: (i) the relative positions on the activation landscape of the representation-realizing points, and (ii) the topography of the landscape itself. Landscape topography is determined by the connections among the nodes and the weights on those nodes. \"Training up\" a network, by progressively altering its weights in accordance with some learning algorithm (e.g., backpropagation of error), amounts to the progressive molding of the activation landscape in a way that results in systematically content-appropriate trajectories from one representation-realizing point to another.  Learning thus involves modification of the existing activation landscape, in a way that accommodates new information while leaving intact the information to which what is learned is irrelevant.\n","\n","Learning to make a certain class of inferences, for instance, produces a slope or incline on the activation landscape. From every point realizing a (possibly complex) representation of a certain kind, the system is inclined to proceed to a point realizing a corresponding representation of a different kind. The landscape also has other inclines, subserving potentially conflicting inferences one has learned to make. And many other inclines too, subserving various potentially conflicting tendencies to evolve from one representational point to another in various non-inferential content-appropriate ways. So the activation landscape is a very high dimensional, subtly contoured, space with inclines upon inclines upon inclines. (Think of the disorientation and contortion of earlier geological strata by rising new land.) Thus, being inclined to make an inference does not mean that one will make the inference.\n","\n","In any particular cognitive trajectory along the activation landscape, information that is part of the content of representation-realizing points along that trajectory is the information that becomes occurrent-i.e., gets explicitly represented-during the cognitive process corresponding to that trajectory. On the other hand, information that is accommodated by the trajectory without being part of the content of any representation-realizing point on it is (relative to that trajectory, anyway) morphologically embodied rather than explicitly represented. The local topographical features of the landscape-i.e., the various different, superimposed inclines present in the immediate vicinity of a given representationrealizing point-are what determine the content-appropriate trajectory from any such point to another one.\n","\n","One special case of inclines in activation space comes up fairly often in connectionist discussions. Representations are thought of as attractor points or regions in activation space, and one speaks of the basin of the attractor-viz, the set of all points in activation space from which the system will evolve to the attractor. A basin is, of course, an incline all individual slopes of which lead to the same place.\n","\n","For a different kind of example of an incline, consider a system that has learned to make a class of Humean inferences. Whenever it encounters an A, it expects a B. But it has never occurrently represented the proposition that A's are B's, and it is not currently disposed to do so. Perhaps if it is sophisticated enough, it could come to occurrently believe that A's are B's by reflecting on its own inferential tendencies. But it has not reflected in that way.\n","\n","In such a case, the information that A's are B's is contained in the system morphologically (but not dispositionally or occurrently). That is, there is an incline in its activation space connecting A-realizing points to B-realizing points, but there is no point in its current activation space that realizes the belief that A's are B's.\n","\n","Consider now the phenomenon of prejudice. A person is strongly inclined to come to certain kinds of judgments, $J$, about anyone (or anything) he classifies as being of a certain type, $K$.  On occasion he feels a need to explain one of those judgments, sometimes from external prodding, sometimes not. On these occasions he comes up with an explanation of the particular judgment that does not refer to type $K$. And typically, the explanations he gives are rather different in different cases.\n","\n","The prejudice consists in an incline in that person's activation space from points realizing representations of individuals as being of kind $K$ to points realizing $J$ judgments about those individuals. The person may have little or no inclination to (occurrently) believe the generalization connecting $K$ to $J$. (Being a human being, he has, of course, the capacity to entertain that generalization.)\n","\n","Often when a $J$ judgment is made, it is preceded by an occurrent representation, $R$, that the person puts forward-to himself or others-as the reason for his $J$ judgment on a particular occasion. But in fact, $R$ is causally inert. There is no path in activation space from points realizing $R$ but not realizing a representation of an individual as of kind $K$ to the $J$ judgment. At the network level, there is no spreading of activation from $R$ to $J$.\n","\n","The incline (in activation space), i.e., morphological content, plays an actual causal role in bringing about the $J$ judgment; the occurrent representation, $R$, does not. Thus, we have here a conceptually possible case of Type 4 functional discreteness. Representation $R$ might be a complex representation that fully justifies $J$-in the easiest case, the premises of a valid argument for $J$. Yet $K$ leads to $J$ only in conjunction with the (mis)information morphologically embodied in the incline from $K$-realizing points to $J$-realizing points; and $K$ leads to $J$ in that case whether or not the inferential trajectory commences from an $R$ realizing point. Furthermore, the person need not consciously represent the fact that the individual is of kind $K$ for his prejudice concerning $K$ 's to come into play. (It is an interesting empirical question whether such a representation must be occurrent at all, even unconsciously.)\n","\n","Consider, in light of the foregoing discussion, RSG's example of Clouseau. Suppose that Clouseau's internal network is at a point p in activation space that realizes the state-type $B$ :\\\\\n","(B) believing that the butler said he spent the night at the village hotel, and that he said he arrived back on the morning train.\n","\n","Suppose that Clouseau's activation landscape has distinct, determinate, inclines within it that respectively subserve trajectories appropriate to belief-types $H$ and T , respectively:\\\\\n","(H) believing that the village hotel is closed for the season.\\\\\n","(T) believing that the morning train has been taken out of service.\\\\\n","(We will call these inclines the $H$-incline and the $T$-incline, respectively.) In the immediate vicinity of the point $p$ on Clouseau's activation landscape that his cognitive system currently occupies, the local topography is a complex contouring consisting of the superposition of various different inclines, including the $\\mathrm{H}-$ incline and the T-incline. Suppose that at point p, the T-incline and certain other inclines (not including the H-incline) effectively \"cancel each other out\"; i.e., when superimposed together, the T-incline and these other inclines jointly make no net contribution to the local topography in the vicinity of p. Finally, suppose that the dominant net effect, locally at point p , is contributed by the H -incline. So an inferential trajectory commences, emanating from $p$ and terminating at a point $\\mathrm{p}^{\\prime}$ which realizes the state-type L :\\\\\n","(L) believing that the butler is lying.\n","\n","This is a scenario in which Clouseau believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, he also believes that the morning train has been take out of service, and he infers that the butler is lying on the basis of the first belief but not the second.\n","\n","This scenario can be further elaborated in several ways, corresponding to Type 2 through Type 5 functional discreteness. If the content of both belief H and belief T is only embodied morphologically in the H -incline and T -incline respectively, but neither content gets occurrently represented during Clouseau's inferential process, then we get morphological/morphological functional discreteness: Type 5. But there are three other variants or the scenario, where the content of one or both beliefs also becomes occurrent, i.e., is part of the representational content of point p , or of some other point along the inferential trajectory commencing from p : H and T both occurrent (Type 2); H occurrent but not T (Type 3); T occurrent but not H (Type 4).\n","\n","So the upshot of this subsection is that all four of these kinds of functional discreteness are open conceptual possibilities, under distributed connectionism. RSG are mistaken to suppose that functional discreteness of cognitive states can only occur if the content of those states is embodied, in weights and/or in activation patterns, in a physically discrete way.\n","\n","[107]\n","\\section*{4. Conclusion.}\n","RSG argue that common sense psychology is incompatible with a certain brand of connectionism because common sense psychology is committed to the functional discreteness of propositional attitudes, while that brand of connectionism precludes functional discreteness. We distinguished three ways in which a cognitive system may possess intentional content: occurrently, dispositionally, or morphologically. Mixing and matching these ways of possessing content leads to several conceptually possible types of functional discreteness. We argued that common sense psychology is committed to only the most innocuous kind of functional discreteness-Type 1 functional discreteness, in which occurrent representations make a causal contribution and merely dispositional ones do not. Virtually any system that has representations, including the systems of RSG's brand of connectionism, will exhibit Type 1 functional discreteness.\n","\n","Common sense also recognizes the possibility of the other types of functional discreteness that we distinguish, and some of these possibilities suggest interesting ways to think about cognition. We suggested (in Section 2.5) that these other types of functional discreteness could be found in distributed connectionist models. Thus, even if common sense psychology is more deeply committed to functional discreteness than we believe, RSG would not have shown that common sense psychology is incompatible with distributed connectionism.\\\\\n","We also argued (Section 3), contrary to RSG, that connectionist theory does have projectable predicates comparable to the propositional attitude predicates of common sense psychology.\n","\n","Even if we have succeeded in showing that RSG's arguments are not successful, this constitutes only a limited defense of the compatibility of connectionism and common sense psychology. There are other arguments afoot (e.g., Davies 1991) that purport to demonstrate an incompatibility between connectionism and common sense.  But addressing such arguments and the issues they raise is a task for another occasion.\n","\n","[108]\n","\\section*{2. The example}\n","Imagine that a number of robots have to learn to stretch out their arms to catch objects sliding off two sloping surfaces. To succeed at the task, the robots must predict when an object will slip off one, or both, of the slopes. They learn to predict this by observing the angle of each slope (which varies unpredictably from one occasion to the next), making a prediction, and then finding out whether their prediction is true. There are two slopes independently set at different angles, so there are two separate learning tasks to be performed in parallel.\\\\\n","$A$ denotes the event that an object will slide off the first slope and $B$ the event that an object will slide off the second slope. Let $x_{1}$ be the angle, measured as a fraction of $90^{\\circ}$, that the first slope is tilted from the horizontal, and $x_{2}$ the angle of the second slope (similarly measured). Objects will only slide off the slopes if they are set at an angle greater than $45^{\\circ}$. In our notation, the two propositions to be learnt are:\\\\\n","$A$ occurs if, and only if, $x_{1}>\\frac{1}{2}$, $B$ occurs if, and only if, $x_{2}>\\frac{1}{2}$.\\\\\n","These facts about the robots' environment are represented in Fig. 1. We may think of the state of the environment as being represented, at any particular time, by a point $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)$ in the diagram. Whether one or both objects will roll off their slopes is determined by the state of the environment on that occasion. ( $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ stand for the non-occurrence of the events $A$ and $B$ respectively.)\n","\n","Now suppose that these robots are equipped with a standard feedforward\n","\n","\n","Fig. 1. A pictorial representation of the environmental regularities to be learnt.\\\\\n","backpropagation (bp) neural net [1] of the architecture, shown in Fig. 2, where the information about the angles of the slopes is fed into the input nodes. They are trained with a fairly large number of ( $x_{1}, x_{2}$ ) states randomly scattered inside the unit square shown in Fig. 1. In each instance, the inputs lead to output activations $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$. Those outputs trigger behavioral responses: If $y_{1} \\approx 1$, then the robot reaches out to catch an object sliding off the first slope. If $y_{1} \\approx 0$ then the robot does not reach out. The simultaneous behavioral response to the second slope is caused by the state of $y_{2}$ in a similar way.\n","\n","We assume that the behavioral responses are fixed by the predictions a robot makes about the occurrences of $A$ and $B[2]$. However, when the prediction proves to be false (as evidenced by the fact that it reaches out and no object slides off or it doesn't reach out and an object does slide off) an error feedback signal is used to update the connection weights in the neural network shown in Fig. 2, as dictated by the familiar bp algorithm. It is important to understand the information about the occurrences of $A$ and $B$ is eventually made available to the robots, via some neurally accessible 'teacher' signal.\n","\n","Given that the training set contains a sufficiently wide variety of examples, we\n","\n","\n","FIG. 2. The robots' neural architecture.\\\\\n","may be assured that the robots will have learnt to respond correctly in all but the most difficult cases in which the slopes are very close to $45^{\\circ}$. Even though we are not told the initial connection weights, nor the detailed list of training examples (except to say that it covered all regions of state space fairly well), we may make some fairly reliable predictions about the post-training behavior of these robots nevertheless.\n","\n","These are the kind of predictions that FP succeeds in making about human beings. In fact we may easily couch our prediction about the robots in terms of the FP concepts of belief and desire [3]: after learning to solve the prediction problem, the robots attain two enduring beliefs: that $A$ will occur if, and only if, $x_{1}>\\frac{1}{2}$, and that $B$ will occur if, and only if, $x_{2}>\\frac{1}{2}$. At any particular time, the robots also have temporary occurrent beliefs about the angles of the two slopes, which combine with the previously mentioned belief states to form predictions about the future occurrence or non-occurrence of $A$ and $B$. These beliefs are what produce the observed behavioral response.\n","\n","An integral part of the FP story, if it were spelled out, would be that the robots have separate beliefs about the two slopes, and that only the beliefs about the first slope are relevant to the robots' response to that slope. This is worth stating because RSG claim that this kind of propositional modularity does not, and cannot, hold true of distributed representations in connectionist networks. For example, their claim is that if both slopes are tilted greater than $45^{\\circ}$, and the robot moves to catch both objects, then all (distributed) representations in the network are causally implicated in both outputs. Propositional modularity cannot be a part of the connectionist explanation of the phenomena.\n","\n","RSG make this claim about both short-term (occurrent) and enduring (dispositional) belief states, and we plan to show that both claims fail in our example.\n","\n","They will concede that propositional modularity holds in cases in which the representations are not distributed across the whole network. It is possible for such a spatially localized solution to develop as a solution to the learning problem in the neural network described. Suppose that all the weights of the cross connections in Fig. 2 are zero. Then, the enduring belief about the connection between the angle of the first slope and the sliding of objects on that slope will be encoded in the connection weights from the $x_{1}$ unit to $z_{1}$ and from $z_{1}$ to the $y_{1}$ unit. Clearly, the representation of that proposition will have no effect on the activation $y_{2}$, just as the thesis of propositional modularity states.\n","\n","We agree that connectionist representations will seldom be spatially localized in this way. In fact, there are distributed weight configurations that solve our training problem. We will spend a few moments describing one such solution, for the details are crucial to the argument. First, we argue for the modularity of the occurrent states, and then extend the discussion to enduring beliefs.\n","\n","Suppose that both hidden units, $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, respond strongly to both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, but they do so differently. They do so in such a way that the information about $x_{1}$ alone, or about $x_{2}$ alone, can be extracted from the hidden units by simply adding, or subtracting, the two hidden unit activations, respectively. In particular, suppose that the activations $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are [4]:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","& z_{1} \\simeq \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\alpha_{1} x_{1}+\\beta_{1} x_{2}+\\text { bias }_{1}\\right)  & z_{2} \\simeq \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\alpha_{2} x_{1}+\\beta_{2} x_{2}+b_{i a s_{2}}\\right)\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","where the 'bias' terms can be thought of as connection weights from units (not shown) that have permanent activation of 1 .\n","\n","For example, suppose $\\alpha_{1}=\\beta_{1}=\\alpha_{2}=-\\beta_{2}$, and $y_{1}$ responds to the sum of $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ (i.e. $\\gamma_{1}=\\gamma_{2}$ ) while $y_{2}$ responds to the difference between $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ (i.e. $\\delta_{1}=-\\delta_{2}$ ). In this case $y_{1}$ will not depend on $x_{2}$ even though $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ depend on both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ and $y_{1}$ depends on $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$. Similarly, $y_{2}$ will have no 'cross-dependence' on $x_{1}$. In this case, the information about the angles of the two slopes is encoded on the hidden units $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ in a distributed way [5]. These are the non-localist representations that RSG claim cannot be functionally discrete. Yet, no matter what the angle of the second slope is, the activation of $y_{1}$ is only affected by information about the first slope.\n","\n","This conclusion follows from a simple 'wiggle' theory of causation: If you 'wiggle' the value of $z_{1}+z_{2}$ without wiggling the value of $z_{1}-z_{2}$ (and they can be wiggled independently) then the value of $y_{1}$ wiggles, but $y_{2}$ does not. But if you wiggle the value of $z_{1}-z_{2}$ without wiggling $z_{1}+z_{2}$, the $y_{2}$ wiggles and $y_{1}$ does not. The example establishes the kind of functional discreteness that RSG deny.\n","\n","The causal facts are not at all mysterious. It is a case in which the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{1}$ exactly cancels the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{2}$, producing a zero resultant effect. The situation here is no different from the example of two concentric solenoids wired in parallel so that each induces an equal but opposite magnetic field at their common center. As the voltage is increased the force exerted on the magnet in the middle by each solenoid increases, but there is no net effect-the magnet never moves.\n","\n","More generally, the condition that $y_{1}$ does not depend on information about the second slope is:\n","\n","$$\n","\\beta_{1} \\gamma_{1}+\\beta_{2} \\gamma_{2} \\simeq 0\n","$$\n","\n","This is most intuitively understood in reference to the leftmost subnetwork in Fig. 4. The term $\\beta_{1} \\gamma_{1}$ measures the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2} \\gamma_{2}$ the effect of $x_{2}$ on $y_{1}$ via $z_{2}$. Notice that the 'local' solution in which the cross connections are zero ( $\\beta_{1}=\\gamma_{2}=0$ ) is just one special way of satisfying the condition. This condition implies that no (short-term) beliefs about the steepness of the second slope will interfere with how the robot acts towards the first slope, which is part of the modularity requirement imposed by FP. The modularity of occurrent beliefs is compatible with the distributed transmission of information through a connectionist network.\n","\n","But what about the modularity of the enduring beliefs? To answer this question, we must first say how the enduring beliefs about the relationship between sliding objects and slope angles are represented in the network. Once learned, the proposition represented is ' $A$ if, and only if, $x>\\frac{1}{2}$ ', for that is the fact relevant to solving the prediction problem. Moreover, the prediction problem is solved once the\n","\n","\n","Fig. 3. A particular neural state, including biases, which satisfies constraints (1'), (1\"), (2) and (2\").\\\\\n","activation of $y_{1}$ matches the teacher signal, which records the (later) occurrence or non-occurrence of $A$ [6].

In these circumstances, the network successfully represents the proposition that the object on the first slope will slide off if, and only if, it is steeper than $45^{\\circ}$ exactly because two conditions are met (see Appendix for the derivation). The first is a constraint on the subnetwork connecting $x_{2}$ to $y_{1}$, while the second is a constraint on the connections from $x_{1}$ to $y_{1}$ (Fig. 4):\n","\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","& \\left(x_{2} \\rightarrow y_{1}\\right): \\beta_{1} \\gamma_{1}+\\beta_{2} \\gamma_{2} \\simeq 0  & \\left(x_{1} \\rightarrow y_{1}\\right):-b i a s_{2} \\simeq \\gamma_{1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4} b i a s_{1}\\right)+\\gamma_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4} \\text { bias }_{2}\\right)+\\frac{11}{24}\\left(\\gamma_{1} \\alpha_{1}+\\gamma_{2} \\alpha_{2}\\right)\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","\n","On the other hand, the same network will also represent the proposition that the object on the second slope will slide off if, and only if, it is steeper than $45^{\\circ}$ just in case\n","\n","\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","y_{2}=1 \\text { if, and only if, } B \\tag{2}\n","\\end{equation*}\n","\n","\n","This leads to a different set of constraints on the connection weights; this time referring to the two subnetworks shown in Fig. 5.\n","\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","& \\left(x_{1} \\rightarrow y_{2}\\right): \\alpha_{1} \\delta_{1}+\\alpha_{2} \\delta_{2} \\simeq 0  \\tag{2'} & \\left(x_{2} \\rightarrow y_{2}\\right):- \\text { bias }_{\\mathrm{b}} \\simeq \\delta_{1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4} \\text { bias }_{1}\\right)+\\delta_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4} \\text { bias }_{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\delta_{1} \\beta_{1}+\\delta_{2} \\beta_{2}\\right) \\tag{2'}\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","\n","The details of these equations are not important. The important point is that neither the conditions ( $1^{\\prime}$ ), ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ), nor the conditions ( $2^{\\prime}$ ), $\\left(2^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$, uniquely determines values for the connection weights and biases-there are more 'unknowns' than equations. Each set determines a class of solutions. The particular solution 'chosen' by the network to solve one prediction problem (e.g. predicting $A$ from $x_{1}$ ) may or may not be in the second class of solutions. This is what allows for the causal modularity of representations encoded on the same set of connection weights and biases.\n","\n","[109]\n","\\section*{3. Causal modularity}\n","Now we are in a position to address the central question: when both 'beliefs' are present, as in our example, are both necessarily implicated in the causal activation of the $y_{1}$ unit (ditto for the $y_{2}$ unit)? It is clear that the connection weights $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\beta_{1}$, $\\beta_{2}$, bias ${ }_{1}$ and bias $_{2}$, are involved in both representations-conditions ( $1^{\\prime}$ ), ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) and $\\left(2^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(2^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. Those weights are causally involved in the activation of $y_{1}$, and involved in both representations. Does it follow that both representations are causes of the output of $y_{1}$ ? We think that this line of argument is fallacious. Consider the following * analogy. Six people are involved in two different charity organizations, $A$ and $B$. Each person is causally influential in the actions of both organizations. But it does not follow that organization $A$ is causally implicated in all of the activities of organization $B$. The answer is 'no' because it is possible that the activity of organization $A$ would be unchanged by the absence of what produces the activities of $B$, if other putative causes were held fixed. It is possible, or even probable, that causes of $B$ 's activities are quite separate and independent of causes of $A$ 's activity, despite the fact that the same set of people are involved in both activities. It is only certain aspects of their behavior that produce a given effect, and different effects may be produced by quite different aspects of their behavior.\n","\n","We shall show that the satisfaction of conditions ( $2^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $2^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) is causally irrelevant to the activation state of $y_{1}$ even when both sets of conditions ( $1^{\\prime}$ ), ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) and $\\left(2^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(2^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ are satisfied. The test for causal relevancy we shall use has become standard for probabilistic theories of causality (Eells, 1991), and the basic idea is just the 'wiggle theory' described earlier: change the satisfaction of conditions ( 2 ') and ( $2^{\\prime \\prime}$ ), while continuing to satisfy conditions ( $\\left(^{\\prime}\\right.$ ) and ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ), and see whether there is a wiggle in the activation $y_{1}$. If 'yes', then conditions ( 2 ') and ( 2 ') are causally relevant. If 'no', then the second representation is not causally relevant to the activation state of $y_{1}$, and we have a concrete example of the propositional modularity of distributed representations, contra RSG.\n","\n","The situation we are imagining is this. Both slopes are tilted at an angle greater than $45^{\\circ}$, and the robot stretches out two hands-one at the bottom of each slope. Both sets of conditions ( $\\left.1^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(1^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ and ( $\\left.2^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(2^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ hold, and the activations of both input units is greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$. Now imagine we keep all causal factors the same, except that the enduring belief about the second slope is absent. That is, we imagine that the input activations are the same, and conditions ( $1^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) continue to hold, but conditions ( $2^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $2^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) do not hold. Would there be a change in the activation of $y_{1}$ ?\n","\n","A cursory examination of equations $\\left(1^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(1^{\\prime \\prime}\\right),\\left(2^{\\prime}\\right)$ and ( $\\left.2^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ will show that this test situation is clearly possible. So, imagine that one, or other, of the equations ( $2^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $2^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) fails to hold, even approximately. There will be no change in the activation of $y_{1}$, since conditions ( $1^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) and the $x_{1}$ input determine that the activation is 1. The behavior towards the first slope is unaffected by the presence or absence of the enduring belief about the second slope. Even though the two representations are simultaneously encoded in overlapping sets of connection weights, one may be causally implicated in a piece of behavior, while the other is causally inert. Thus, the functional separability of distributed representations establishes their causal modularity in this example [7].\n","\n","Certainly, the FP example that RSG use is not completely analogous to ours, but it only takes a single example to refute their claim. Nevertheless, it is instructive to repeat the argument in the more difficult case. So let's return to Alice: she went to her office as a result of her desire to speak to her research assistant, not as a result of her desire to send e-mail messages. Further, assume that Alice's desire to send e-mail messages would have caused her to go to her office had she not wanted to talk with her research assistant, but this is not what caused her to go to her office on this occasion. Examples like this are well known as cases of causal overdetermination, and are the bugbear of counterfactual theories of causation [8]. Watson shoots at Moriarty a moment after Holmes fires. It is Holmes who kills Moriarty, even though the same effect would have resulted even if Holmes had not fired.\n","\n","RSG contend that FP states may exemplify such overdetermination, but the distributed representations of connectionist networks could not. In order to refute their claim in such cases, let us embellish the robot example. Suppose that once the robots come to believe that one or the other of the objects will slide, they immediately proceed to noisily crank up their hydraulic pressure. We may suppose that the pump is switched on by the activation of a node $C$. Its pattern of activation, in association with the beliefs that $A$ and $B$ (represented as $y_{1}=1$ and $y_{2}=1$, respectively) is shown in the table below (ignore the last column for now):\n","\n","\n","Notice that if $B$ is believed $\\left(y_{2}=1\\right)$, the state of $y_{1}$ marks no change in the activation of $C$. But can it make sense to say that, in the previous situation in which both beliefs are present, and the cranking behavior ensues, that it was the activation of $y_{1}$, and not of $y_{2}$, that caused the behavior? We maintain that such a claim makes perfectly good sense in the context of the connectionist model in Fig. 6.\n","\n","Let us suppose that all the biases are zero, and the weights are as shown. Then this is how the network works. In any case in which $y_{1}=1$, an inhibitory signal is sent to the hidden unit $u_{2}$ preventing it from transmitting any information. That is, any signal from $y_{2}$ must overcome a threshold value of 100 , which is impossible since the loudest signal coming from $y_{2}$ is 10 . Therefore, unit $u_{2}$ will be 'off' no matter what the state of $y_{2}$. Since $y_{2}$ can only affect $C$ through $u_{2}$, it cannot affect it at all when $y_{1}$ is on. However, $y_{1}$ will turn $C$ 'on' via unit $u_{1}$. This accounts for the first two rows of the table above. In either of these cases, it is natural to say that the robot cranks up its hydraulic pressure because it believes that an object is going to slide down the first slope, even though it may also believe the same thing of the second slope. This is true in spite of the fact that the robot would still have 'cranked up' in response to the second belief in the absence of the first (row 3 in the table). In this case, there is no inhibitory signal to block the influence of $y_{2}$ on $C$, and in that case $C$ will be 'on' if, and only if, $y_{2}$ is 'on'. The situation is completely analogous to Alice going to her office because she wanted to talk to her research assistant despite the fact that she would have gone to her office anyway. Or to the situation in which Moriarty would have died from a bullet wound even if Holmes had not fired his pistol.\n","\n","One reviewer has suggested that the RSG example might be given another interpretation. Perhaps Alice's going to her office was not overdetermined by her desire to send e-mail messages, even though that desire was present and was a potential cause. Perhaps she would not have gone to her office at all if her desire to talk to her research assistant (the actual cause) had not been present. These causal facts are just as easy accounted for in a connectionist model. All we need to suppose is that the state of some third node ( $D$ in Fig. 7) serves to inhibit the causal activation of Alice's desire to send e-mail messages. That is, the activation of $y_{1}$ produces the activation of $C$, but this would not be activated without $y_{1}$ since the only other potential cause $y_{2}$ is inhibited by node $D$.\n","\n","In conclusion, there is still nothing that we can find in the underlying neural level story that is incompatible with the causal yarn that FP weaves around the same events.\n","\n","[110]\n","\\section*{4. The general nature of the argument [9]}\n","Our analysis of the robot example is already sufficient to show that the claim RSG make about propositional modularity is too strong. But what have we learnt about other connectionist models, and what can we expect to be true of the causal modularity of more biologically plausible models than the ones under present consideration?\n","\n","In particular, our argument depended on the possibility of changing the satisfaction of conditions ( $2^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $2^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) without changing the satisfaction of conditions ( $1^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ). In our example, it is simply a mathematical fact that this is possible. Figure 8 is an abstract representation of the situation. Any point on the diagram represents a particular set of values for the weights and biases of the network, such as the example in Fig. 3. The solution set for the first prediction task represents the set of possible states of the networks that implement a successful solution to that task. Similarly for any other possible prediction problems. To assert that a simultaneous solution to tasks 1 and 2 is possible is to assert that the intersection of the corresponding solution sets is not empty. But our argument depended on the additional assumption that there are states in the solution set for task 1 that are not solutions of task 2. But maybe this is only true in our network because it 'employs a number of gratuitous, unnecessary connections and hidden units' [10].\n","\n","First, a general point. Some degree of redundancy of weights and hidden units in connectionist models of human cognition is part of what makes them biologically plausible-allowing for the graceful degradation of cognitive capacities and relative insensitivity to brain damage (clearly distributiveness alone does not guarantee these properties).\n","\n","In what follows, we present a new and specific reason why network architecture must be sufficiently redundant so that it could solve task 1 without solving task 2 (as well as solving both simultaneously). The idea is really very simple:\\\\\n","any connectionist model of human cognition must allow for the simultaneous solution of a variety of possible prediction tasks. Let us call this property learning adaptability. In particular, we assume that the network is at least capable of simultaneously solving task 1 with task 2 and of simultaneously solving task 1 with task 3 , where the solution set for task 3 does not overlap with the solution set for task 2 (see Fig. 8). For example, suppose that the world were such that $B$ occurs if, and only if, $x_{2}$ is less than $\\frac{1}{2}$, instead of greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$. Again, the task in such a world is to match the activation of $y_{2}$ with the occurrence of $B$. This task is incompatible with task 2 , since we now require that the weights and biases are such that the $y_{2}$ output is activated by $x_{2}$ inputs of less than $\\frac{1}{2}$. Learning adaptability requires that a network be versatile enough to cope with a variety of possible learning situations. In fact, we are tempted to point to this as one of the essences of human intelligence [11].\n","\n","From the assumption of learning adaptability, it follows that there is a state of the network which solves tasks 1 and 2 , and one that solves 1 but not 2 . Therefore, the representations developed to solve tasks 1 and 2 are functionally discrete, as required. Once this is granted, we can apply standard tests of causal relevance in order to establish the causal modularity of representational states. And that is just what we did in our simple example.\n","\n","[112]\n","\\section*{3. Ramsey, Stich and Garon's Argument}\n","Having clearly laid out what they take the theory they are challenging to be, RSG go on to present a characterisation of the Connectionist theory they suggest will replace folk psychology. We'll refer to this as 'Connectionism RsG '. Their central claim is that networks of this class cannot be understood from within the framework of folk psychology, because it is not possible to locate symbols which satisfy the constraints of propositional modularity within the network. RSG look at states of the system which might be candidates for being semantically interpretable symbols and find that they are not functionally discrete, and hence cannot be considered folk psychological symbols. Since folk psychology permits intelligence to be instantiated only in systems which consist of states which satisfy the three stated criteria, RSG conclude that folk psychology is incompatible with Connectionism $_{\\mathrm{RSG}}$. It follows from this incompatibility that if Connectionism ${ }_{\\mathrm{RSG}}$ is successful as an explanation of cognition, folk psychology can't be.\n","\n","Apart from the input layer and the output node, it is impossible to identify any form of 'propositional representation' or 'distinct symbolic expression' which can be semantically interpreted. This is illustrated by the problems encountered in localising failure when training up a network. If during the training period the network fails to exhibit the appropriate behaviour, it is often impossible to point to any one node, or collection of nodes, which in particular are the cause of the failure. The important point here is that the 'knowledge' of the system is widely distributed throughout the network, not localised. As well, the most obvious candidates for symbolhood, the weights of the connections and the threshold values at the nodes, fail to satisfy the constraints of folk psychology. The example is provided of two networks (networks A and B - see Figures 1 and 2) which have been trained on nearly identical sets of propositions (see Figure 3). The only difference in the training of the two networks is that network B has been trained on one proposition not used in the training of network A. Taking network A alone, which behaves like many classical models when asked to confirm or deny propositions, we fail to find a functionally discrete state or part which can be said to represent a particular proposition. Comparing the two networks, inspection of the connection weights and thresholds reveals no projectable features which can explain the similarities and dissimilarities in their behaviour. Since there exist no such discrete states (symbols), it cannot be asked if they play a causal role in the network's computation. The main point is summarised thus:\n","\n","Both the problem of localising failure and the lack of projectable features illustrate that the folk psychological condition of discreteness is violated. No analysis of the network can provide discrete entities which have the appropriate semantic features and are also causally efficacious, and hence there exist no folk psychological symbols.\n","\n","It is certainly true that immediate inspection of the networks RSG use as illustrations doesn't locate any clearly marked symbols, nor is it obvious what projectable features the different networks have in common or differ with respect to. If we accept that there really is no symbolic interpretation at all to be made of the network, then it seems we must accept that folk psychology cannot hope to explain the network. If folk psychology cannot encompass explanation which includes this network, or any cognitive model which uses Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ architecture, then we must accept that the success of Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ as a general theory of cognition does pose a threat to folk psychology.\n","\n","This network as a whole might be construed as the means by which a single folk psychological symbol could be found in a cognitive system. Hybrid models of just this sort have been posited (e.g. Harnard [1989]); however, RSG want no part of this sort of story. A hybrid would not present a problem for folk psychology, as folk psychology is uncommitted on how its symbols and their interactions might be instantiated, apart from the propositional modularity requirement above. Folk psychology does not require that the internal structure of symbols themselves be explained by further symbolic manipulation, only that by whatever means a symbol is instantiated as a unit, the unit itself be functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, and causally efficacious. Instead, RSG are suggesting that an extended version of their simple network will, as a whole, instantiate a full cognitive agent. Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ as a theory must then be in competition with folk psychological theory, they claim, since there will exist within such an agent none of the necessary folk psychological entities. Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RsG }}$ will thus be able to explain cognitive phenomena that folk psychology can't. If RSG can show this, then they have made a very significant claim. Folk psychology claims all cognitive phenomena (at the appropriate level) as within its explanatory domain, and so a model of cognition that does not permit a folk psychological explanation of clearly intelligent behaviour would show that folk psychology does not have a monopoly on explanatory power in the cognitive domain. This is recognised by Fodor and Pylyshyn, for example, who go to great length in their [1988] in attempting to show that Connectionism cannot do the explanatory work required of a cognitive theory.\n","\n","[113]\n","\\section*{4. Dispositions}\n","Replies and objections to RSG's position are dealt with briefly towards the end of their paper, and while they dismiss their importance without significant argument, it is not at all clear that they have dodged these attacks quite as successfully as they claim.\n","\n","In the section 'Objections and Replies', RSG deal with the suggestion that (in the case of network A) the various 4-tuples of activation of the hidden units which correlate with the 'processing' of a query might be considered to be folk psychological symbols. For example, when the proposition 'Dogs have fur' is presented in its symbolically coded form at the input, the 4-tuple of activation values at the four hidden units which thus results can be said to be the functionally discrete state which encodes the 'knowledge' that dogs have fur. Of course, these patterns of activation only appear at specific times because of specific input, so RSG entertain the suggestion that the disposition to exhibit the 4-tuple $\\underline{\\mathrm{x}}=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}\\right)$ corresponding to the activation values of the four hidden units, is the actual symbolic state of (say) the representation of the proposition $X$. A defence of folk psychology along thesc grounds, with specific reference to RSG, is found in Jackson and Pettit [forthcoming b]. I was tempted by exactly this sort of defence, and it indeed goes a long way toward answering RSG's claims about the irrelevance of folk psychology to Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ networks. Ultimately, I think it fails to identify symbols with exactly the right properties to satisfy propositional modularity. Its worth looking at it briefly, however, in order to clear up what sort of representations we will eventually be looking for.\n","\n","The system's disposition to produce a pattern of activation is a state which looks as though it correlates with folk psychological ontology (e.g. the disposition to produce a certain 4 -tuple could correspond to the network believing that 'Dogs have fur'). It has the discrete properties required by folk psychology since such dispositions are semantically interpretable as discrete propositions (constraints 1 and 2 in section 2). According to RSG however, the problem is that these dispositions cannot be considered as being causally effective in a functionally discrete way. They use the example of Inspector Clousseau, who believes $Q$, who believes $R$, who believes that $Q \\rightarrow P$, and who believes that $R \\rightarrow P$, and comes to believe that $P^{6}$ From the perspective of folk psychology it makes sense to ask 'Was it the belief that $Q$ which led to the belief that $P$, was it the belief that $R$, or was it the belief that both $Q$ and $R ?$ '. But in the case of the network this query becomes 'Was it the disposition to exhibit activation pattern q, , or the disposition to exhibit activation pattern $\\underline{\\mathrm{r}}$, or both, which caused the disposition to exhibit activation pattern $\\underline{p}$ ?'.\n","\n","Following Armstrong [1973], dispositions can be considered as having an underlying physical basis, the 'categorical basis'. The dispositional account of neural network behaviour may then be more convincing if we show that the dispositions are shorthand for physical states and processes. The fault in the dispositional account, as described by RSG, is that dispositions can't be said to cause anything in a functionally discrete way. But if the disposition is merely a convenient shorthand for a complex physical state, then that complex physical state might well cause things in the discrete way required. There are two important points to be made about why it is that dispositions can be considered causal in a functionally discrete way - first, the physical basis of dispositions means they can be thought of as causal agents; and second, counterfactuals about the role of a dispositional representation could sort out exactly what the functional role of a given disposition is.\n","\n","Firstly, Jackson and Pettit [forthcoming b] discuss conductivity in regard to the discreteness of dispositional properties (ms. p. 9ff), noting that there are a whole range of dispositional properties of metals, for example, which all have the same physical basis - the sub-atomic and atomic structure of the metal in question. This one categorical basis gives rise to conductivity, ductility and opacity, just to name a few of its dispositional properties. Only one of these dispositions, however, need (or indeed properly should) be cited in a causal account of the behaviour of the metal. In the example of Jackson and Pettit, a person dies when she allows her ladder to touch power lines. She dies because the ladder is an electrical conductor,  not because it is opaque, regardless of the fact that both the ladder's opacity and its electrical conductivity have the same physical basis. Similarly in a Connectionist network - all the beliefs stored in one network have the same physical basis, but only one of the dispositions (to exhibit a certain activation pattern) will be cited in a causal account of the network's behaviour, only one of the dispositions need be realised in a given situation. Since a given disposition can properly be invoked in a causal account, while other dispositions which share the categorical basis of the first will not be, it is clear that dispositions can be said to be causal in a discrete way.\n","\n","Secondly, we can ask 'what if' questions to determine the functional role of a given disposition. If the disposition to exhibit $q$ was absent from the network, and it was found that in this case the network did not come to have the disposition to exhibit $\\underline{p}$, then surely the representation of ' $Q$ ' has played a causal, and functionally disrete, role in the representation of ' $P$ '? This suggests that one way of determining the functional role of a disposition would be to posit a counterfactual: 'If the system did not 'know' (wasn't trained to recognise) $Q$ (or $R$ ), would it have still deduced $P$ in the same way?'. 9 In the example posited, there are actually four possible answers,  each of which is intelligible in folk psychological terms. First, if the training of the network on $R$ makes no difference to the production of $P$, then we can conclude that $Q$ led to $P$. Secondly, the training of the network on $Q$ makes no difference, hence $R$ led to $P$. Thirdly, neither $Q$ nor $R$ makes a difference, hence $P$ was not concluded from $Q \\rightarrow P$, nor from $R \\rightarrow P .^{11}$ Fourthly, both $Q$ and $R$ are necessary for $P$, hence the network concluded $P$ from $(Q \\&$ $R) \\rightarrow P$. If we can answer this sort of question then we can be sure that the relationships between the representations of $P, Q$ and $R$ are causal, and we can comfortably identify the discrete role of each proposition the network encodes.\n","\n","We can be sure that dispositions are capable of causal agency and that if the counterfactuals discussed can be answered in a sensible way, then the dispositions clearly have an explanatory role, and thus an Instrumentalist position like Dennett's is saved. But propositional modularity demands that symbols be able to 'bump into' each other in some way and that their physical interactions can give rise to other symbols. If the categorical basis of a disposition is the whole network, or at least is the same for each symbol, then there is a problem in suggesting that the symbols can interact in the way required by propositional modularity.  Something can't be said to 'bump into' itself, nor do we typically talk of a ladder's opacity and conductivity causally interacting with each other. Without the ability to causally affect each other, candidate symbols do not satisfy the causal effectiveness requirement of propositional modularity, and thus are not the symbols required by folk psychology. If we are to reject RSG's claim that Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ is incompatible with folk psychology, we need symbols which are more than explanatorily useful - we need symbols which are fully propositionally modular. Any symbols in the network need to be able to 'bump into' each other in such a way that computation is effected. In order to identify such symbols, we'll first have to take a closer look at RSG's example.\n","\n","[114]\n","\\section*{5. A Connectionist CPU?}\n","RSG highlight folk psychology's explanatory requirements in their discussion of Inspector Clousseau - explanations of deduction in folk psychology require that it be decidable which of a number of possible antecedents was instrumental in the reaching of a conclusion. The few clues we are given by RSG as to exactly what Connectionism $_{\\mathrm{RSG}}$ is do not extend to an explanation of how Connectionism ${ }_{\\mathrm{RSG}}$ could instantiate a deductive system. Nowhere is it demonstrated that a Connectionist $_{\\text {RSG }}$ network could deduce new information in a manner which would correspond to (and perhaps explain) the deductions of Inspector Clousseau.\n","\n","Interestingly, the network provided as an example by RSG does come to 'know' new information. As explained on p. 516, the network generalized from the 'knowledge' that dogs have fur, paws, fleas and legs, and that cats have fur, paws and fleas, to the 'knowledge\" that cats have legs. This ability at (in this case correct) induction is clearly interesting and important; however it doesn't challenge folk psychology's account of deduction. RSG are right when they say that folk psychology will demand answers to the sorts of questions discussed above (Did Inspector Clousseau infer $P$ from $Q$ or from $R$ ?), but a network which exhibits induction does not immediately assist our understanding of how a folk psychological account may or may not fit a network model of deductive behaviour.\n","\n","This problem emphasises just how big the task RSG have taken on is in that their very small, very simple (as it stands) network is intended to illustrate a complete model of cognition.\\\\\n","Another serious problem with the example provided by RSG is that it is static - it is eternally committed to the input/output relations it presently exhibits. At the completion of training, any 'knowledge' that the system has is already there. The network has already concluded that cats have legs (for example) long before it was ever asked. The question of how it goes about doing induction is applicable to the training history, not to the completed network.\n","\n","RSG's challenge to folk psychology is to find symbols in their network. We have located, in dispositions to exhibit activation patterns, states which do the explanatory work of symbols, if not the causal work. RSG's suggestion seems to be that a Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RsG }}$ network manipulates symbols as if by magic: if you plug the symbols into the black box, other appropriate symbols come out, but don't ask what's inside. Even though they claim Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RsG }}$ to be a psychological theory, they in fact provide no explanation at a level higher than that which deals with connection strengths and biases. Somehow the relationships between the input propositions are recognised by the black box and, if we think folk psychology has such networks within its explanatory domain, we need to illustrate how these relationships are recognised in a way which is compatible with folk psychological demands for propositional modularity.\n","\n","First, we should recognise that the coding of the input propositions clearly satisfies the criteria of propositional modularity. From Figure 3 we can surmise that the coding for 'dogs' is the 8 -bit binary word 11000011 , and of 'have legs' is 00111100 , giving the 16 -bit input representation 1100001100111100 for 'dogs have legs'.  Now in the training process we might prefer to appeal to these (unequivocally, I take it) propositionally modular representations as the causal agents by which inference is effected. Remembering that RSG's example as it stands doesn't do anything much at all, and certainly doesn't do any inference after training is complete, it is to the training history we have to look to see what's going on.\n","\n","In simple systems like RSG's examples, we can see that the network is a mechanism for the causal interaction of the input representations. 'Dogs have fur', 'Cats have fur', and so on, are compared by the network (even though the two representations are not presented simultaneously to its input), and the result of the comparison is available to the output. The appropriate analogy here, I think, is with a von Neumann CPU,  in that a standard CPU is also a mechanism for the causal interaction of propositional representations (typically a machine code command and a value in the accumulator or some other immediately accessible memory). If we view the network as a processing device, the effect of one symbol's interaction with the network is stored in the structure of the network so that it makes a difference to the effect of the next symbol's interaction, and all this happens during training. Unlike a CPU however, a network needs to be presented with an input many times in order for it to respond appropriately. I don't want to suggest that this example network, and a von Neumann CPU, are involved in the same sort of computations - CPU's don't do induction, just like RSG's network doesn't do deduction. However I do want to claim that there is no mystery to the fact that the network is able to make use of relations between propositions (like the inferability of 'cats have legs' from the rest of the data set) in a sensible way.\n","\n","The important shift in interpretation here is between the network purely as a storage device (which is the emphasis provided by RSG), and as a processor (which is the view which suggests the comparison with a CPU). We are interested in RSG's network as a (prototype) cognitive model not just because it can store information, but because it can learn and it can infer. Given this, perhaps we can view a Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ network as just a very fancy way of having symbols 'bump into' each other. Here we should remember that any system which manipulates representations must have at bottom a form of computation which follows rules which are tacitly  represented in the system - there must be a point at which the system stops looking up more explicitly represented rules. In the case of a CPU, the system is wired in such a way that the representation corresponding to a command (say LD 2) 'bumps into' the representation of a certain value (a binary number in the accumulator) in just the right way so that the register labelled 2 is thence found to contain the value which was in the accumulator. That is, the CPU just knows how to execute the program command, without appeal to any other symbols.\n","\n","A cognitive system (or sub-system) along the lines of RSG's networks can be considered as a fancy way of allowing a whole bunch of propositional representations to interact with each other - not by having the symbols interact simultaneously, but by storing the effect of the symbolic representations in such a way that each new representation interacts in a well-defined way with all the previous symbolic representations. A network which remembers, like RSG's, is rearranging its input/output relationships so that the effect of one proposition's representation is taken into account when other representations 'bump into' it through the network. A von Neumann CPU is capable of processing a very limited number of symbolic representations at a time (one command, possibly an argument to that command, and the current value of the accumulator). A Connectionist $_{\\text {RSG }}$ network can be considered as like a more complicated CPU which permits the interaction of many symbols 'at once' by a sophisticated 'summation' of the input representations, summed over the training period. The network just knows how to give a result to the simultaneous processing of a whole bunch of inputs.\n","\n","There is a stage in all physical symbol systems where the interaction of the symbols has to be explained through the physical characteristics of the symbols manipulated and the environment in which they operate. In a CPU we must eventually appeal to the patterns of electrical activity and the hard-wiring to show exactly what it is about the binary representation of LD 2 which places the current contents of the accumulator in register 2 . In a Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ system, the causal interaction of symbols must also be described non-symbolically. It is just the way the network is wired (described by its set of weights and thresholds) which determines the effect of two symbols bumping into each other through the network; but this doesn't mean that there isn't symbolic computation going on. The network calculates a relationship between the input representations purely on the basis of their physical syntactic properties. It is the relationship calculated by the network which is novel, not the fact that it can do this sort of calculation. Just as RSG's simple network performs some sort of induction on its inputs, a Connectionist $_{\\mathrm{RSG}}$ network capable of deduction would be able to do the appropriate work on $Q$ and $Q \\rightarrow P$ without having both symbols occurrent at its input at once.\n","\n","The basic idea then is to interpret Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ networks as processors of propositional representations. Just as is the case when explaining a von Neumann CPU, there is a point at which we have to stop looking for propositional representations inside the device, and explain its behaviour by appeal to the physical (syntactic) properties of the input and output representations. Under this interpretation, folk psychology is not under attack from Connectionsim ${ }_{\\mathrm{RSG}}$, since folk psychology is able to account for the behaviour of a network just as well as it can account for the behaviour of a standard CPU. It does so by appealing only to symbols which unproblematically satisfy the criteria for propositional modularity (those at the input and output) and to the physical (syntactic) properties of those symbols.\n","\n","[115]\n","\\section*{6. Has Folk Psychology Been Saved?}\n","The approach suggested here requires looking at RSG's examples with a different emphasis than they provide. Propositional modularity, through its causal effectiveness requirement, is about commitment to process. not storage, and this is acknowledged by RSG in their central folk psychological example of Inspector Clousseau. The important point in these examples is not that information be stored in a propositionally modular way, but that it be used in such a way. For folk psychology to be true, when we explain an inference by the use of the proposition $Q$, we expect a propositionally modular symbol of $Q$ to be identifiable at an appropriate place in the system such that it could have causally interacted with another symbol(s). It is this which is the central demand of folk psychology, not that storage be immediately identifiable as propositionally modular.\n","\n","It is in this context that it is appropriate to remember that propositional representations in von Neumann computers are not immediately recognisable as propositionally modular. But what a von Neumann computer does do is render the representation in memory into a propositionally modular form at the input to the CPU for processing when the representation needs to be used. My suggestion is that a Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ network is just a different, more complicated, and possibly more powerful, way of having propositional representations causally interact with each other in a semantically interesting way. RSG's Connectionist system processes folk psychological symbols, and does so purely on the basis of the syntactic features of those symbols. No magic is required.\n","\n","A few caveats are in order here. Firstly, this approach to Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RsG }}$ is limited to networks with propositional inputs and outputs. Many of the examples found in the general field of PDP deal with input codings that are not clearly propositional, and so this argument has no immediate application to them. Secondly, it might be argued that the complexity of the primitive operations over symbols of Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ networks is much greater than that of the primitive operations over symbols encountered in cognitive theories which appeal to propositionally modular symbols. Such an argument might suggest that there is no algorithm, expressible in terms of propositionally modular symbols, which captures what is involved in the primitive symbolic operations.  Certainly the induction and pattern matching abilities of Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ networks (which might be seen to be the primitive symbolic operations of the 'Connectionist CPU') are very powerful. It may well be that an important lesson to be learnt from Connectionist research is that the sort of symbol processing we are familiar with involves the wrong sort of primitive symbolic operations. Nevertheless, the reliance on relatively sophisticated primitive operations does not require that we do away with propositionally modular symbols. I don't see that it is at all necessary for the primitive symbolic operations to be themselves captured by an algorithm which is expressed in terms of propositionally modular symbols. Thirdly, by urging this interpretation I am possibly contradicting what I take to be one of RSG`s assumptions, that a larger version of their network could instantiate a whole cognitive agent. My interpretation of how to scale up their network to a full cognitive agent is different, I suspect, to theirs, since I agree with Fodor and Pylyshyn [1988] that a system based purely on the associationist sort of principles\n","particularly the infinite generability which seems to be required of a language user. But there is no reason why any propositional manipulation which does exist within a cognitive agent couldn't be achieved through a 'Connectionist CPU' rather than a von Neumann CPU. Thus I am really positing a sort of hybrid model, but not one where the symbols are instantiated in networks, but where the central processing is done by networks.\n","\n","I don't see that violence has been done to RSG's position however, because the central thrust of their argument is that whatever is cognitively interesting about their example can't be explained in a way which is compatible with folk psychology. The important consequence of the truth of this claim is that whatever degree of cognitive function Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ can explain, folk psychology can't. This consequence needs to be avoided by supporters of folk psychology if folk psychology is to retain its claim to being a theory of cognition in general. So acceptance of the plausibility of Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RSC }}$, under the interpretation given by RSG, in anything other than trivial cognitive functions which deal with propositional information, will deal a blow to folk psychology, and so folk psychology needs to reply.\n","\n","The reply I'm advocating here is one that recognises that the processing of folk psychological symbols will not itself be explained by appeal to more folk psychological symbols. Some sort of symbol processing is presupposed by folk psychology, and it is not inconsistent with folk psychology to suggest that symbol processing be done in a Connectionist ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ system. To see Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ as supplementing folk psychology (by plugging a few holes, as it were), which is essentially the view here, is not to view it as an implementation of folk psychology. But neither is it to place Connectionism ${ }_{\\text {RSG }}$ in competition with folk psychology.\n","\n","[120]\n","\\section*{II. The model}\n","Forster and Saidel have correctly interpreted the main and central theme of our original essay. There we argued that: (1) folk psychology is committed to propositional modularity, i.e. the view that beliefs and desires are semantically evauable, functionally discrete states that play a causal role in inference and behavior; and (2) certain types of connectionist models-namely those which encode information in a widely distributed manner-do not invoke states or structures with these properties. Hence, if models of this sort prove to be correct, then belief-desire accounts of mental processes would be mistaken. In response, Forster and Saidel have produced an ingenious network that they claim does indeed involve states that have both distributed encoding and the requisite propositional modularity. Hence, according to them, our original claim about models of this sort must be mistaken.\n","\n","To answer these charges, I want to suggest a couple of reasons why I do not agree that their model establishes the conclusion that our position is mistaken. The first reason concerns their claims about this particular model. What I will try to show is that under close scrutiny, one finds that the model is in some ways distributed and in some ways causally modular. However, the aspects of the model that are causally modular are not the aspects that are truly distributed; and the aspects that are distributed are not truly modular. The second reason concerns doubts I have about the extent to which their claims about this model generalize to other sorts of distributed models. Here I want to suggest that there are features of their network which make it somewhat unusual and perhaps disqualify it as a truly distributed network.\n","\n","[121]\n","\\section*{II.a. The short-term beliefs}\n","Is it true that this network possesses distributed representations that are also functionally discrete? To answer this question, we need to focus on the structures and states that are claimed to be representations. According to Forster and Saidel, the network has two possible short-term beliefs and two enduring beliefs which interact in different episodes of cognition. Let's begin with the short-term beliefs. Unfortunately, it is not clear exactly which structures or states Forster and Saidel have in mind as the relevant encodings of these transient beliefs. However, one very natural interpretation would be take the activation value of the input unit $x_{1}$ to represent the steepness of the first slope, and the activation of input unit $x_{2}$ to represent the steepness of the second slope. This interpretation seems plausible because the activation of these two units straightforwardly corresponds to the steepness of the two slopes. But notice that on this interpretation, the short-term beliefs about the angles of the slopes are given a completely localist encoding, since distinct units are used to represent distinct, individual propositions. Consequently, whatever functional discreteness or causal modularity these beliefs have is completely irrelevant to our argument, since we were concerned with non-localist encodings. We never denied that non-distributed, localist representations can be functionally discrete. Naturally, if specific structures are used to encode specific beliefs, there will be no problem in asking whether the belief was present or causally implicated while other such structures were inert.\n","\n","The same point can be made if we include the activation of the hidden units in our encoding, as Forster and Saidel clearly wish to do (p. 441). While it is far from clear to me just how the semantic evaluation of these units is supposed to go, once you fix their representational content so that the particular activation level of a given unit-or, if you like, a given set of units-corresponds with a particular short-term belief, then it is a relatively trivial matter to trace the causal role of these structures or states on any given run of the system. But this is because these are localist encodings [1], not because our argument is unsound. On the other hand, one could deny that there is any straightforward semantic evaluation to particular states or structures of the system, as I am inclined to think about the hidden units and their activation levels in this model. But then, of course, it becomes hard to see what could motivate calling these states and structures 'beliefs'.\n","\n","A puzzling feature of Forster and Saidel's discussion of short-term beliefs is that the model actually involves structures that are causally discrete in a way that, oddly enough, Forster and Saidel seem to want to deny. For instance, they insist that on certain weight configurations (where $\\alpha_{1}=\\beta_{1}=\\alpha_{2}=-\\beta_{2}$ and $\\gamma_{1}=\\gamma_{2}$ ) the activation of $y_{1}$ 'will not depend on $x_{2}$ even though $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ depend on both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ and $y_{1}$ depends on $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}{ }^{\\prime}$ (p.441). But this seems false. Consider Fig. 1 , where an example of the weight configuration ratio specified by Forster and Saidel is implemented. If we assume that the hidden units behave as they do in standard connectionist models, where they are either on to some degree or off (but they do not take a negative activation value), then it seems quite clear that $y_{2}$ can indeed depend upon the activation of $x_{2}$. If $x_{2}$ should become active while $x_{1}$ remains off, then $x_{2}$ will come to activate $y_{1}$ via the $\\beta_{1} \\rightarrow z_{1} \\rightarrow \\gamma_{1}$ pathway (though $z_{2}$ will remain inert). Why deny the relevance of $x_{2}$ to $y_{1}$ ?\n","\n","Forster and Saidel's reasoning seems to be that the only way that $x_{2}$ can have an effect on $y_{1}$ is either via the $\\beta_{1} / \\gamma_{1}$ channel, or via the $\\beta_{2} / \\gamma_{2}$ channel. Moreover, they feel that the pathway of $\\beta_{2}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ will cancel out the effects of pathway $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{1}$. For example, they state that \"the condition that $y_{1}$ does not depend on information about the [second] slope is: $\\beta_{1} \\gamma_{1}+\\beta_{2} \\gamma_{2}=0$ \" (p.441). But why read the model this way? In the first place, it makes the role of the hidden units extremely problematic. If the overall output of the system is simply a matter of summing the products of the second layer connections with the interlinked first layer connections, as suggested here, then it is difficult to see just what exactly the hidden units are doing. Second, consider a scenario where both $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are fully activated. In this situation, it seems perfectly natural to say that it is $\\alpha_{2}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ that cancel each other out, since they both terminate in the same unit. That is, instead of supposing that the negative weight of $\\beta_{2}$ neutralizes the $\\beta_{1} / \\gamma_{1}$ pathway, it seems more reasonable to interpret it as neutralizing the effect of $x_{1}$ on hidden unit $z_{2}$-thereby leaving the hidden unit unactivated but allowing $x_{2}$ to contribute to $y_{1}$ via the $\\beta_{1} / \\gamma_{1}$ link. If the $\\alpha_{1}$ connection should breakdown, why suppose it is the $\\alpha_{2} / \\gamma_{2}$ pathway that is activating $y_{1}$ instead of the $\\beta_{1} / \\gamma_{1}$ pathway? As far as I can see, there is no reason to interpret the causal channels of this network in the way suggested by Forster and Saidel.\n","\n","But even if their interpretation of the causal pathways were correct-and I confess that I do not have a firm grasp of 'wiggle' theory of causation-the crucial point regarding short-term beliefs remains. These cases do not challenge our original claim because they all involve non-distributed representations. This point also applies to Forster and Saidel's discussion of overdetermination in their elaborated robot example. In all of these cases of causal modularity-where it is possible to designate certain structures or states as specific representations-our claim goes untouched because our argument was concerned only with distributed representations.\n","\n","[122]\n","\\section*{II.b. The long-term beliefs}\n","But what about the two enduring beliefs of Forster and Saidel's ingenious network? Here matters are much more interesting, for it was the causal modularity of the long-term beliefs that was the primary concern of our original paper. If Forster and Saidel can show that there are semantically evaluable states which are functionally distinct in the way folk psychology supposes beliefs are, but nonetheless encoded in a distributed manner, then they would indeed provide a significant challenge to our argument. According to Forster and Saidel, the first enduring belief encoded is \"the object on the first slope will slide off if, and only if, it is steeper than $45^{\\circ}$ \" (p. 442) and the second enduring belief encoded is \"the object on the second slope will slideoff if, and only if, it is steeper than $45^{\\circ}$ \" (p. 442). What warrants the assignment of these beliefs to the internal structures of the model? Forster and Saidel state, \"... the proposition is successfully represented just in case output is connected to input so that $y_{1}=1$ if and only if $A$, at least approximately\". In other words, the network is interpreted as having the enduring beliefs about objects rolling off the slopes in virtue of their behavior in certain conditions.\n","\n","Now I have some strong doubts about saving folk psychology by way of these sort of semantic evaluations. The main worry is that these content assignments depend upon a behaviorist criterion of belief ascription. Given the sad history of behaviorism and its well-documented conflict with common sense, it seems prima facie doubtful that this strategy would work. For example, it seems quite plausible to suppose that an important role for beliefs in folk psychology is the explanation of behavior. But if a necessary and sufficient condition for having a belief just is a particular behavior in certain conditions, then the explanatory work of the belief regarding that behavior is at best problematic. Nor is it clear to me, given the content of the beliefs, how the model could have false beliefs on this criterion of ascription.\n","\n","However, for the sake of argument, I am willing to grant these belief ascriptions and move on to the question of distributed but functionally discrete encodings. Does the network possess these? To answer this question we must focus upon those structures and states used for the encodings, just as we did for the short-term beliefs. What are the structures encoding the first belief, that the object will slide off the first slope if and only if it is steeper than $45^{\\circ}$ ? According to Forster and Saidel, there are two conditions relavant to this belief which involve two subnetworks ( $x_{2} \\rightarrow y_{1}$ ) and $\\left(x_{1} \\rightarrow y_{1}\\right)$. Thus, if we combine these two subnetworks, we get all the relevant structures for the encoding of the first enduring belief, as shown in Fig. 2. We can do the same for the second enduring belief, combining the relevant subnetworks to illustrate those structures used to encode this belief, as seen in Fig. 3. Thus, excluding the input and output units, Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the parts of the network used to encode the first and second enduring beliefs, respectively. These are the structures which must be functionally discrete for their argument to work.\n","\n","Given that the representations are structured in this fashion, it is easy to see that the encodings of the long-term beliefs do not entirely overlap-the connections $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ help encode the first belief but not the second, while connections $\\delta_{1}$ and $\\delta_{2}$ help encode the second but not the first. Consequently, as far as these 'second layer' connections go, the encodings are entirely non-distributed and localist. Moreover, changes in these connections would indeed effect one condition without influencing the other, so they do entail a form of causal modularity. But, of course, this modularity does not damage our argument because, as already noted, these are completely localist encodings. So, what parts of the network employ truly distributed encodings? Clearly the parts that have work to do in representing both of the beliefs; namely, the connections $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}, \\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$, and the two hidden nodes and biases. So it is these structures that must possess functional discreteness (in a way that gives different causal roles to the two beliefs) for our argument to be challenged. Is this possible? Here it seems clear that it would be impossible to change one condition without also changing the other. If, for example, we alter condition $2^{\\prime}$ in such a way that $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}$ both take very strong negative values (but $\\delta_{1}$ and $\\delta_{2}$ remain positive), this modification would also clearly have a profound effect on the first condition encoding the first belief. So, with regard to the parts of the network that truly involve distributed representations, changing one encoding condition does indeed influence the causal role of the other. Consequently, Forster and Saidel's model fails to undermine our claim that distributed representations are not functionally discrete.\n","\n","Another way to see this point is to consider the way in which Forster and Saidel specify the conditions for functional discreteness. According to them, the test for functional discreteness is roughly the following: does changing the structures (or conditions) relevant to the encoding of one belief alter the effects of structures relevant to encoding the other belief when the second set of structures (or conditions) are held constant? If the answer is 'no', then they are functionally discrete; if 'yes' then they are not.\n","\n","As it stands, this criterion for functional discreteness strikes me as inadequate, since it cannot accommodate a number of intuitive cases of causal interdependency. For example, it cannot handle cases where the interdependency is because it is impossible to change structures responsible for one representation without, at the same time, changing the structures responsible for the other representation (i.e. cases where it is impossible to alter one set of structures and hold the other set constant). A better test for functional discreteness would be the following: does changing the one encoding have any influence at all on the causal role of the other? If we take this as our test of causal modularity, then it seems clear that with regard to those structures encoding the long-term beliefs in a truly distributed manner-i.e. the connection weights in the first layer of the model, $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}$ and $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$-there is no causal modularity. The only way that conditions ( $1^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) can be wiggled that does not influence conditions ( $2^{\\prime}$ ) and ( $2^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) is by modifying those structures (the second-layer connection weights) that encode the beliefs in a non-distributed fashion. Consequently, the parts of the model that encode truly distributed representations are not functionally discrete, and the parts of the model that are functionally discrete do not encode truly distributed representations.\n","\n","[137]\n","\\section{3. Ramsey, Stich, and Garon's Argument.}\n","\n","Arguments for eliminativism presuppose that folk psychology is a theory, and hence a candidate for elimination or replacement. Beliefs, desires, and the other propositional attitudes, on this view, are plausibly regarded as posits of a commonsense theory. Central to Ramsey, Stich, and Garon's (hereafter, RSG) argument is the claim that folk psychology is committed to a cluster of claims called propositional modularity, according to which propositional attitudes are . . . functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behavior. $(1991,204)$\n","\n","The claim that beliefs and desires, as characterized by folk psychology, are causally efficacious is supported by the fact that the folk psychological explanation of a behavior typically cites a particular desire (in conjunction with appropriate beliefs) as the cause of the behavior. Thus, for example, the explanation of Alice's going to her office might plausibly cite her desire to send e-mail messages as the cause of her going to the office, even though Alice also wants to speak to her research assistant, and had she not wanted to send e-mail messages, the desire to speak to her research assistant might have caused the behavior. The thesis that beliefs and desires are functionally discrete states amounts to the claim that it makes sense to talk of acquiring or losing them one at a time. Thus it makes sense, for example, to say that after awakening from a nap Henry forgot that he had unplugged the phone. He may have forgotten nothing else.\n","\n","RSG's claim that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete states needs qualification in light of the oft-noted holism (or, at least, anatomism) of belief. If Henry has forgotten that he has unplugged the phone, he has also forgotten (hence, currently does not believe) that he has unplugged something, that he cannot currently be contacted by telephone, etc. The individuation of belief in commonsense practice is fine-grained enough that these count as distinct beliefs. It is therefore doubtful that individual beliefs can be acquired or lost one at a time. However, this qualification aside, I shall grant RSG's claim that folk psychology is committed to something like propositional modularity. The question, then, is whether connectionism poses a threat to the propositional modularity of beliefs and desires.\n","\n","The LOT is clearly compatible with propositional modularity, since it posits states which are themselves functionally discrete, semantically evaluable, and causally efficacious in the production of behavior, with which propositional attitudes are type-correlated. Indeed, according to Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988, 57), \"conventional [computational] architecture requires that there be distinct symbolic expressions for each state of affairs that it can represent.\" Thus, the LOT, if true, would explain the propositional modularity of beliefs and desires.\n","\n","Some connectionist networks are similarly compatible with propositional modularity. In \"localist\" connectionist models, individual units or small clusters of units are assigned a semantic interpretation. Thus, if a unit representing fur is always activated when a unit representing dog is activated, then the ensemble consisting of the two units and the connection between them might be construed as the system's representation of the proposition all dogs have fur.\n","\n","However, not all connectionist networks exhibit this sort of functional localization. In all but the simplest networks, the connections between the input units of the network (whose activation values represent an encoding of the input to the system) and the output units (whose activation values encode the output the system has computed from the input) are mediated by hidden units, which represent neither the input nor the output. RSG describe a class of connectionist cognitive models with the following additional properties: (1) individual hidden units (and weights and biases) in the network have no plausible symbolic interpretation; and (2) the encoding of information in these networks is not local but rather distributed over many nodes and connection strengths. These networks may plausibly be regarded as holistically encoding a set of propositions, although the representational strategy employed is what Smolensky (1988) has termed 'subsymbolic,' since none of the hidden units, weights, or biases can comfortably be construed as symbols.\n","\n","In the connectionist models under consideration, no distinct state or part of the network serves to represent any particular proposition. Large chunks of the network (that is, many units, many connection strengths, and many biases) play a role in each computation, with individual units, weights, and biases encoding information relevant to many propositions. The representation of any given proposition is widely scattered throughout the network. It appears that such models do not posit distinct states with which the functionally discrete, semantically evaluable, causally efficacious states characterized by folk psychology might plausibly be identified, from which RSG conclude:\n","\n","If these models turn out to offer the best accounts of human belief and memory, we will be confronting an ontologically radical theory change-the sort of theory change that will sustain the conclusion that propositional attitudes, like caloric fluid and phlogiston, do not exist. (1991, 218)\n","\n","RSG's argument can be explicitly formulated as follows:\\\\\n","(1) the network lacks functionally discrete, identifiable substructures that are semantically interpretable as representations of individual propositions;\\\\\n","(2) therefore, the representation of a particular proposition cannot plausibly be said to play a causal role in the network's computation;\\\\\n","(3) however, folk psychology is committed to the propositional modularity thesis, which implies that particular beliefs do play causal roles in specific cognitive episodes; and\\\\\n","(4) therefore, if the best models of human cognitive processes are distributed connectionist networks of the sort described, then folk psychology is false.\n","\n","Compelling though this argument may appear, it fails to establish its conclusion. (1) is true for a wide range of connectionist models-socalled \"distributed\" networks. However, (2) follows from (1) only if the representation of a particular proposition must be realized as a discrete, identifiable substructure to be causally efficacious. RSG do not offer an argument for this claim. To establish its truth, and hence to establish claim (2) of their argument, RSG need to argue that distributed representations are epiphenomenal-that they play no causal roles in the network's behavior-something that they do not attempt. The growing literature on distributed representations does not construe them as epiphenomenal. (See, for example, Hinton, McClelland, and Rumelhart 1986, and Van Gelder 1991.) If distributed connectionist models are taken at their face, and in the absence of an argument to the contrary surely they should be, then claim (2) of RSG's argument appears to be false.\n","\n","The argument from connectionism to eliminativism collapses with the apparent falsity of step (2). But suppose that (2) were true. It might turn out that distributed representations are epiphenomenal-that the complex states that are assigned semantic interpretations in the best connectionist models play no causal roles in the networks' computations. The causal generalizations that describe the networks' behavior, let us suppose, do not advert to these particular complex states. The semantic interpretation of these states in the envisioned models would play a purely heuristic role, allowing us to keep track of what the network is doing. Would the eliminativist conclusion follow? It follows only if propositional attitudes, to be causally efficacious, must be realized as structures which figure explicitly in the causal generalizations of a lower level cognitive theory. However, to assume that they must is to presuppose an unsubstantiated, and very strong, constraint on inter-theoretic compatibility. It is not generally true that the causal generalizations of a lower level theory will advert to the complex of structures that realize a causally efficacious state posited at a higher level of theory. Very often, the complex will be arbitrary from the perspective of the lower level theory. (This will be true even if the higher level states are not multiply-realized by lower level structures.) For example, there is at present no biochemical characterization of the gene responsible for sickle cell anemia, but it is very unlikely that the complex biochemical structure that realizes the gene is theoretically significant from the perspective of biochemistry. Nonetheless, the likelihood that the causal generalizations of biochemistry do not advert to this particular structure does not impugn the molecular geneticist's claim that the gene causes the sickle cell condition. (This example was suggested to me by Robert McCauley.) Analogously, the possibility that those complex structures that precisely realize beliefs and desires do not figure in the causal laws of the cognitive-level science does not threaten the causal efficacy of the propositional attitudes.\n","\n","Nor is there any reason to assume that beliefs and desires must be realized as functionally discrete cognitive structures to satisfy the functional discreteness component of propositional modularity. It is not generally true that functionally discrete items posited at one level of theory must be realized by structures which are treated as functionally discrete at lower levels. The sickle cell gene, as characterized by molecular genetics, is functionally discrete-it plays a distinct role in the development of the phenotype-yet the complex of chemical structures realizing it may have no discrete biochemical role.\n","\n","The point here is that beliefs and desires need not be realized in structures that are causally efficacious, functionally discrete, and semantically evaluable as characterized by a lower level theory to satisfy the demands of propositional modularity. This cluster of commitments describes how folk psychology itself characterizes such states. Thus, even if the representations of particular propositions were to turn out to be epiphenomenal, from the standpoint of connectionist theory (because they play no\n","characterizable causal roles in connectionist models), the eliminativist conclusion that RSG want would not follow.\n","\n","However, while RSG have failed to discharge the eliminativist burden, the following worry may remain: if one's entire psychological state underlies a particular belief, as seems to be the case in the connectionist models under consideration, does it not follow that propositional attitudes are emergent out of underlying psychological processes, that there is no explanation of how beliefs are realized psychologically? Not necessarily. It remains true that the device has a particular belief because of the information represented in the system. Standing beliefs may well be explainable in terms of the learning history and connection strengths of the system, and occurent beliefs (those causally efficacious in a particular behavioral episode) may be explainable in terms of the current pattern of activation of hidden nodes of the system. It is no mere accident that the network behaves as it does.\n","\n","Consider, once again, the functional discreteness component of propositional modularity. Recall that RSG $(1991,205)$ gloss it as the claim that \"it typically makes perfectly good sense to claim that a person has acquired (or lost) a single memory or belief\" as, for example, it makes sense to say that after awakening from a nap Henry forgot that he had unplugged the phone. By adjusting the input to a network, the activation levels of individual units, and the connection weights and biases of the ensemble, one can change the representations in a distributed connectionist network. It may not be transparent how this is to be accomplished for a particular proposition, as it is in classical models or localist connectionist networks, where one simply changes the local state (in classical models, by adding or deleting the appropriate data structure); however, inter-theoretic realization relations in science are rarely so tidy. (Forster and Saidel (forthcoming) describe a very simple distributed network where a single representation, realized in a distributed fashion, can be added to or deleted from the network's representational repertoire, indicating that functional discreteness is not incompatible with non-discrete realization.)\n","I have argued that propositional attitudes need not be realized by discrete computational-level structures to be causally efficacious and functionally discrete. RSG's conclusion could be salvaged if the claim that propositional attitudes are realized by discrete computational structures is a fundamental commitment of folk psychology itself, entirely independent of its commitment to propositional modularity. If folk psychology did make such a claim, then it would be rightly viewed as in part a theory of psychological processes, and consequently a competitor to some forms of connectionism. In the next section, I shall argue that folk psychology makes no commitment regarding how propositional attitudes are realized and imposes no substantive constraints on cognitive architecture. If I am correct, then folk psychology is not incompatible with any form of connectionism.\n","\\\\\n","[138]\n","\\section{4. A Minimalist Construal of Folk Psychology.}\n","\n","My argument against RSG does not claim that distributed connectionist networks really do posit structured states that might plausibly be identified with propositional attitude tokenings. Nor does it appeal to what might be called a neo-Rylean construal of folk psychology according to which beliefs and desires are construed not as causally efficacious internal states of agents but as abstracta or logical constructs out of behavioral patterns (see Dennett 1991, Van Gelder (forthcoming)), and thus immune, in principle, to an eliminativist challenge.\n","\n","I shall call the construal of folk psychology defended here, according to which our commonsense theory involves no substantive commitments about how the internal causes of behavior are realized, either computationally or physically, the minimalist construal, or simply, minimalism. The minimalist construal of folk psychology might be seen as a special case of Mark Johnston's more general Minimalist thesis, according to which \"metaphysical pictures of the justificatory undergirdings of our practices do not represent the crucial conditions of justification of those practices.\" (Johnston 1992, 590) Jackson and Pettit (1990) and Horgan and Graham (1991) have also defended versions of minimalism.\n","\n","Minimalism construes folk psychology as committed to something like the propositional modularity thesis: propositional attitudes are semantically-evaluable internal states of agents and are characterized by their roles in the production of behavior and other mental states. These roles are specified by generalizations of which the following are typical examples:\\\\\n","(S) (p) (A) [If S wants p, and S believes that doing A is the only way to bring about p , then (ceteris paribus) S will do A ]\\\\\n","(S) (p) (q) [If S believes p, and S comes to believe that if p then q , then (ceteris paribus) S will come to believe q$]$\\\\\n","(S) (p) [If S fears p , then (ceteris paribus) S does not want p ].\n","\n","Generalizations of this sort, which taken together constitute a theory tacitly known by the folk and deployed by them in the explanation of mental phenomena and behavior, characterize propositional attitudes by reference to their typical causes and effects, intentionally described. They say nothing about the physical or computational realization of these states.\n","\n","As a construal of folk psychology, minimalism occupies an intermediate position between neo-Rylean and behaviorist positions which deny that propositional attitudes are to be construed as causally efficacious internal states and architecturally committed, or extravagant, interpretations of folk psychology. A defense of the minimalist position, therefore, requires argument on both flanks.\n","\n","Neo-Ryleans typically construe folk psychological explanations of behavior as rationalizing, rather than causal. Their purpose, it is claimed, is to \"situate a piece of behavior in the space of reasons,\" to show that it is rational (and hence, predictable) in the circumstances, rather than to cite actual causes. A non-causal construal of folk psychology insulates it from seemingly hostile developments in empirical science. If the argument in the previous section is correct, then insulation is not necessary. Moreover, a non-causal construal is not supported by actual practice.\n","\n","Neo-Ryleanism is revisionary about our shared explanatory practices. It certainly seems as if we take beliefs to be effects of perception and inference, and causes (in conjunction with desires) of action. We often say things such as \"He believed he was about to be fired because he saw a confidential memo that criticized his job performance\" and \"She quit smoking because she believed it was affecting her health.\" There is no reason to suppose that \"because\" here functions any differently than in locutions which are clearly causal, such as \"The fire started because the electrical system was overloaded.\" In claiming that commonsense explanations of belief fixation and action are not causal, despite appearances, the neo-Rylean assumes a rather heavy burden of proof.\n","\n","The case for a causal construal of belief-desire attributions does not rest solely on linguistic intuitions. Attribution theory is the branch of social psychology that studies the perceived causes of behavior. (See Heider (1958) for the classic statement of attribution theory; see Kelley and Michela (1980) and Weiner (1990) for more recent surveys of the attribution literature.) Attribution theory's applications take us well beyond the domain of folk psychology. For example, attribution theorists have argued that an agent's self-esteem and susceptibility to depression are a function of whether the prime determining factor (\"locus of causality\") of the success or failure of a behavioral event is thought to be an external condition beyond the agent's control (for example, luck) or an internal condition of the agent, such as an enduring character trait (see Peterson and Seligman 1984). Of present relevance is the fact that a large and influential body of research in empirical psychology is predicated on the claim that beliefs, desires, and more permanent conditions such as character traits are implicated in causal explanations of behavior. For example, an agent's failure to expend the amount of effort required to secure a goal may be attributed to the fear that he will fail, or a world-class athlete's Herculean efforts in the face of adversity may be attributed, in part, to her belief that she is the best at her sport. According to attribution theory, the propositional attitudes ascribed in such explanations are construed (by the folk) as causes.\\\\\n","While it seems clear that folk psychology does construe beliefs and desires as internal causes, the available evidence supports nothing stronger than minimalism. Minimalism contrasts sharply with extravagant construals of folk psychology, some of which claim that propositional attitudes, as explicated by folk psychology, have a language-like structure (e.g., LOT), must be realized by discrete computational states, etc. Extravagant construals typically underlie eliminativist arguments,  although advocates of folk psychology, especially those who anticipate that computational psychology will provide a vindication of the folk categories, have typically assumed extravagant construals as well. (Lycan (1991) and Rey (1991) assume that folk psychology construes propositional attitudes as relations to mental representations; i.e., both assume a version of the LOT.) Folk psychology is better off without such friends. Tying folk psychology to the fate of particular processing-level proposals that purport to explain why the folk theory is true (or how it works) is an invitation to eliminativism. More to the present point, extravagant construals are simply unsupported by folk psychological practice.\n","\n","It has been noted that some form of intentional explanation is universal among adult humans (Forguson and Gopnik 1988, Fodor 1987). Significantly, there is a striking degree of interpersonal agreement on belief and desire ascription, despite widely divergent opinion (or more accurately, ignorance) about what beliefs and desires really are (that is, what they are made of and how they do their causal work). For the purposes of predicting and explaining the behavior of others-folk psychology's spe-\n","cial forte-it does not matter to folk psychology's practitioners whether propositional attitudes are realized by discrete computational states, largescale neural structures, or some sort of mysterious soulstuff, where the global $v s$. local/discrete distinction has no clear application.\n","\n","The point is incontrovertible if we bring young children within our purview. There is compelling evidence from developmental psychology that children have acquired the concepts belief, desire, and intention by the age of six or seven (Astington, Harris, and Olsen 1988, Wellman 1990). The basic elements of our folk psychological understanding of ourselves are in place by this time. Of course, young children often have trouble predicting (and explaining) the behavior of others, and there is considerable disagreement among developmental psychologists regarding the correct explanation for their deficiencies. (See Wimmer and Perner (1983) and Forguson and Gopnik (1988) for competing accounts.) There is, however, no evidence to support the view that very young children's problems with belief ascription are attributable to ignorance of our cognitive architecture; nor is there any evidence to support the idea that six year olds have a more sophisticated understanding of our cognitive architecture than younger children. Furthermore, developmental psychologists agree that by six years of age children are proficient folk psychologists, although there is no evidence that by this age they have acquired a general belief that causally efficacious states must be realized by structures that are themselves functionally discrete. (It is sometimes suggested that children have a crude \"billiard ball\" model of causation, but a mechanistic model of causation provides no support for a claim about how beliefs and desires are internally realized.) What the evidence does support is a minimalist construal of folk psychology: young children are fully capable of attributing beliefs and desires to their fellows; what they are attributing are simply semantically evaluable internal states that are causally efficacious in the production of behavior (and other propositional attitudes). There is no evidence suggesting that they have any beliefs about how these causally efficacious states are realized.\n","\n","What about adults? Attribution theory is once again of relevance, and it indicates that the adult's conception of propositional attitudes is continuous with the child's. While the folk posit enduring, stable states that play causal roles in producing behavior, there is no evidence that they share any particular views on underlying psychological or neural processes or mechanisms.\n","\n","It appears, then, that the available empirical evidence supports the minimalist construal of folk psychology over the alternatives. So construed, folk psychology is not susceptible to eliminativist arguments of the sort that have been offered, although it is conceivable that folk psychology could be false. Since propositional attitudes are internal causes, being behaviorally indistinguishable from a believer is not sufficient for being a believer. The behavior must be caused by internal states that play the causal roles characterized by folk psychological generalizations. The fact that a system's behavior is predictable using folk psychological generalizations is compelling evidence that the system has such states, and is a true believer. But this evidence is defeasible. I have argued that it would not be defeated by the failure of scientific psychology or neuroscience to find independently characterizable states or structures with which propositional attitudes tokenings can be identified.\n","\n","However, it is not hard to imagine a case where the behavioral evidence would be defeated. Imagine a robot, behaviorally indistinguishable from a typical human (right down to behavioral dispositions), whose \"actions\" are produced by Martian scientists manipulating its motor and speech organs by remote control (cf. Peacocke's (1983) story). Although folk psychological generalizations would be useful for predicting the robot's behavior, the robot is not a model of folk psychology, because its behavior is not caused by internal states of the sort characterized, in terms of their causal roles, by folk psychological generalizations. The robot's behavior is not caused by its own beliefs and desires. It may have no internal states with the appropriate causal roles (i.e., no beliefs and desires). It seems to be a mere conduit for the intentions of others.\n","\n","It is possible, therefore, to imagine circumstances where folk psychology would be false. If most of the \"human\" population were remotecontrolled robots, then all \"output-side\" folk psychological generalizations-those purporting to explain behavior-would be false. Behavior would not be caused by beliefs and desires of the behaving subject.\n","\n","Let us call the extrabehavioral condition on being a folk psychological subject the autonomy condition. I shall not attempt to give the autonomy condition a positive characterization-suffice it to say that it requires simply that the subject's behavior is not the result of manipulation of its motor and speech organs by an external agent. There is indirect evidence to support the claim that the autonomy condition is an essential commitment of the folk psychological understanding of ourselves. Courts of law are often asked to rule on issues of intentional agency. In doing so they consider not only the subject's behavior, but also whether the behavior was caused by intentional states of the subject. Imagine a case where a person kills someone while under the control of a hypnotist. Assuming that it could be determined that the killing really was the result of hypnotic suggestion, it would not be considered an intentional action of the hypnotized subject, and (provided that he had not paid the hypnotist to make the fatal suggestion) the person would not be convicted of murder (The hypnotist is more likely to be regarded as the murderer, inasmuch as the intentional action resulting in the death is attributable to him.) The hypnotized subject's behavior was not caused by the subject's own beliefs and desires. It does not fall under a folk psychological generalization, precisely because the subject's bodily movements were under the direct control of an external agent. We can generalize to get the autonomy condition-if all of a subject's behavior were under the direct control of an external agent (e.g., a hypnotist), then since none of folk psychology's output-side generalizations would be true of the subject, it would not be a model of folk psychology. Indeed, if the etiology of its behavior were understood, it is unlikely that such a subject would be considered a person.\n","\n","To summarize the argument in this section: empirical evidence on the folk understanding of belief supports what I have called minimalism, the thesis which holds that propositional attitudes are construed as causally efficacious internal states, but denies that there are widespread views about how such states are realized. Since folk psychology imposes a minimal extrabehavioral condition on being a folk psychological subject (viz. autonomy), it is not compatible with every conceivable cognitive architecture. If most \"humans\" had the architecture of remote-controlled robots, then folk psychology would be false. But nothing short of fantastical scenarios of this sort would clearly falsify it. It is not threatened by discoveries about our cognitive architecture of the sort that connectionists are hoping for.\n","\\\\\n","[140]\n","\\section*{2. From connectionism to eliminativism}\n","The intentional eliminativist wishes to deny the existence of intentional entities. So, in general, the eliminativist aims to show that a mature theory of mind will fail to quantify over entities that have properties akin to beliefs and desires. From this point a general eliminativist strategy is born: to distill from commonsense psychology the essential properties of the intentional entities it postulates, and then show that entities with just these properties are incompatible with the framework that is to ground our mature cognitive psychology.\n","\n","It comes as no surprise, therefore, to find that this indeed is the strategy employed in the line of reasoning that connects connectionism with eliminativism. Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon, for example, puruse the strategy in the following way (forthcoming). They begin by isolating what they take to be a number of essential properties that commonsense psychology attributes to its intentional entities:\n","\n","Though commonsense contains a wealth of lore about beliefs, memories, desires, hopes, fears, and the other propositional attitudes, the crucial folk psychological tenets in forging the link between connectionism and eliminativism are the claims that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behavior. (forthcoming, Section 3)\n","\n","They then go on to argue that entities with just this cluster of properties are not instantiable in connectionist models: [1]\n","\n","The information encoded in [a connectionist network] is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network. Whenever information is extracted from [a network], by giving it an input string . . . , many connection weights, many biases and many hidden units play a role in the computation . . .\n","\n","Since information is encoded in [this] highly distributed manner, with each connection weight and bias embodying information salient to many [stored representations], and information regarding any given [representation] scattered throughout the network, the system lacks functionally distinct, identifiable sub-structures that are semantically interpretable as representations of individual propositions. (forthcoming, Section 5)\n","\n","And this prompts them to conclude that:\\\\\n","There is, in [connectionist] models, nothing with which the propositional attitudes of commonsense psychology can be plausibly identified. If these models turn out to offer the best accounts of human belief and memory, we will be confronting an ontologically radical theory change-the sort of theory change that will sustain the conclusion that propositional attitudes, like caloric and phlogiston, do not exist. (forthcoming, Section 7)\n","\n","So connectionism leads to eliminativism, according to Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon, ultimately because connectionist models employ a distributed form of representa- tion: it is as a result of employing such a distributed representational system that connectionist models lack functionally discrete, semantically interpretable substructures that are plausibly identifiable with the intentional entities of commonsense psychology.\n","\n","The trouble, however, is that things aren't quite this straightforward. For while the former point, that connectionist models employ a distributed form of representation, is patently true, it just does not sustain the latter inference, that there are no functionally discrete, semantically interpretable sub-structures in these systems. Let's have a look at this in a new section.\n","\n","[141]\n","\\section*{3. The role of activation patterns in connectionist models}\n","The problem with the line of reasoning employed in the previous section is that it is based on an incomplete characterization of the processing activity of connectionist models. It is incomplete because it fails to take into consideration what we might term the 'network properties' of these models. These are the properties that are found, not at the level of the individual processing units and connection weights that comprise a connectionist network, but at the level of the whole network itself. And once we change our perspective and consider the activity of connectionist models at the network level, a good deal of information processing structure not mentioned by Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon is revealed.\n","\n","Most important of these network level properties, at least for our present purposes, are the activation patterns that are generated across connectionist networks in the course of their processing activity. For these activation patterns, contrary to the line of reasoning in the previous section, do represent functionally discrete sub-structures of connectionist systems.\n","\n","A pattern of activation is generated in a connectionist network whenever the network is exposed to an input over its input units. This activation pattern is made up of the individual activation values of all, or more commonly, a large sub-set, of the processing units that comprise the network. And as such, the activation pattern exists as a physically structured, isolable state of the network. Moreover, activation patterns are not merely inert features of connectionist models; they do have isolable causal effects on the information-processing activity of these systems. And this causal involvement is far from incidental. This is because the activation pattern represents the network's 'solution' to the 'problem' posed by the input array. It represents, in other words, the computation that the network as a whole performs (in contrast with the computations performed locally by individual units) in response to its input. And the resultant activation pattern achieved is then used to initiate further causal activity, acting either as input to another network in the system, or as an instruction to a motor response mechanism that is connected to the network.\n","\n","So not only do activation patterns represent functionally discrete sub-structures of connectionist systems, they represent a central causal mechanism by which information is processed in these systems. And because these sub-structures do play such a significant causal role in the information processing activity of connectionist models, they are just the sorts of things that might sustain discrete semantic interpretations. What is more, they typically do sustain such interpretations in extant connectionist models, as even the briefest foray into the relevant literature will attest. (See, for example, the connectionist model of human learning and memory in McClelland \\& Rumelhart (1986a) and the model of past tense acquisition in Rumelhart \\& McClelland (1986a), both of which have been much discussed in the literature.)\n","\n","Consequently, it doesn't seem overly reckless to suggest that the activation patterns of connectionist models might be just the right kinds of sub-structures to instantiate the intentional entities of commonsense psychology. In fact, this thesis rather tends to present itself. And if the thesis can be sustained, the eliminativist line of reasoning that we saw in the previous section simply fails to go through: connectionism and commonsense are quite compatible after all.\n","\n","[143]\n","\\section*{5. The causal dynamics of beliefs and desires}\n","For some readers, however, this extension of the original thesis might appear to be a case of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. While it may solve the problem of endurance, it might be thought it only does so by doing considerable damage to our commonsense understanding of the causal dynamics of beliefs and desires. Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon, for example, do feel exactly this. They put the point as follows:\n","\n","While dispositions to produce activation patterns are indeeded enduring states of the system, they are not the right sort of enduring states-they are not the discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires. (forthcoming, Section 6)\n","\n","There are really two separate claims here. The first is that commonsense psychology is everywhere committed to the discrete causal activity of the intentional entities it postulates. And the second is that connectivity matrix dispositions are not causally active in this discrete fashion.\n","\n","In defence of their first claim, Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon embark on an analysis of the causal dynamics of the commonsense framework. It is worth quoting them at some length:\n","\n","On the commonsense view it may sometimes happen that a person has a number of belief clusters, any one of which might lead him to infer some further belief. When he actually does draw the inference, folk psychology assumes that it is an empirical question what he inferred it from, and that this question typically has a determinate answer. Suppose, for example, that Inspector Clouseau believes the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel, and that he said he arrived back on the morning train. Suppose Clouseau also believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, and that the morning train has been taken out of service. Given these beliefs, along with some widely shared background beliefs, Clouseau might well infer that the butler is lying. If he does, folk psychology presumes that the inference might be based either on his beliefs about the hotel, or on his beliefs about the train, or both. It is entirely possible, from the perspective of commonsense psychology, that although Clouseau has long known that the hotel is closed for the season, this belief played no role in his inference on this particular occasion. [And so here] we see commonsense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert. (forthcoming, Section 3)\\\\\n","The moral of this story, for Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon, is that according to common- sense, intentional entities, whenever they are causally active, are so in an isolable, discrete fashion. They always causally interact, that is, as individuals.\n","\n","In defence of their second claim, that connectivity matrix dispositions do not causally interact in this isolable, discrete fashion, Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon write:\n","\n","In a distributed connectionist system... the dispositional state which produces one activation pattern is functionally inseparable from the dispositional state which produces another. Thus it is impossible to isolate some [items of information] as causally active in certain episodes, while others are not. (forthcoming, Section 6)\\\\\n","The point here is that, as we have noted, connectivity matrix dispositions are not isolable features of connectionist networks. And this has the consequence, according to Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon, that it is impossible to isolate the causal activity of any individual disposition, and thus any individual item of information implicitly stored in the network. Instead, because of the holistic nature of the information encodement here, there is a real sense in which all the information encoded in the network's connectivity matrix is causally implicated in any processing in which the network engages.\n","\n","Together, then, these two claims spell trouble for the modified version of our thesis. In tandem they suggest that we cannot identify connectivity matrix dispositions with beliefs and desires because the former cannot mimic the causal properties of the latter. Consequently, if we are to continue to propound our thesis, we must show that at least one of these claims is untenable.\n","\n","The second claim seems difficult to deny. While Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon are not wholly correct when they argue that connectivity matrix dispositions are functionally inseparable (as they are functionally separable at least in that case when they are causally implicated in generating their associated activation patterns in a network), it is patently clear that these dispositions do not everywhere causally interact in a functionally discrete manner. So this leaves us with the first claim, that commonsense psychology is committed to the universal causal discreteness of the intentional entities it quantifies over.\n","\n","With this first claim in mind, it is worth remembering that the explicit representations of connectionist networks do indeed have isolable causal consequences. So connectionism is actually committed to a certain amount of causal discreteness. However, if we were to try to take this further by arguing that whenever commonsense required the causal activity of a belief or a desire, then this belief or desire would simply have to be explicitly represented in a connectionist model, we would run into insurmountable difficulties. For as we have already seen, information in connectionist systems need not be explicitly represented in order to be causally efficacious. So implicit beliefs and desires will tend to throw their weight around whether we like it or not. And thus if commonsense is committed to universal causal discreteness, Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon are right: commonsense psychology would not survive any connectionist revolution.\n","\n","However, Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon are wrong about commonsense psychology's commitment to universal causal discreteness. In truth, commonsense is actually committed to a good deal of what in contrast we might call causal holism. And the best way to see this is to reconsider the causal dynamics of the commonsense framework.\n","\n","Consider again Inspector Clouseau's inference that the butler is lying. From the commonsense perspective, Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon inform us, this inference was based either on Clouseau's beliefs about the hotel (i.e. his belief that the butler said he stayed the night at the village hotel, and his belief that the village hotel is closed for the season) or on Clouseau's beliefs about the train (i.e. his belief that the butler said he had arrived back on the morning train, and his belief that the morning train has been taken out of service) or on both. And what is more, they continue, whichever beliefs were responsible were causally active in a functionally discrete fashion-it is entirely possible, for example, that either of these sets of beliefs was inert in this particular cognitive episode.\n","\n","Well maybe. But what else does the commonsense framework have to say about the causal processes behind this inference? For a start, it would seem that Clouseau's inference was also based on his (clearly longstanding) belief that in order to lie one must say something untruthful. So this belief must have been causally involved as well. And then there is, of course, Clouseau's (again longstanding) belief that a hotel is a place where one can stay overnight, as well as his belief that if a hotel is closed for the season then one cannot stay there overnight. These beliefs, too, it would seem, were causally implicated to some degree. Similarly, there is Clouseau's belief that a train is something that can transport people from one place to another, and his belief that if a particular train has been taken out of service then it can't transport people.\n","\n","And since we have started down this track, we might as well go on. For if we poke around at Clouseau's inference with our commonsense framework we can expose some more longstanding beliefs that, it would seem, were causally implicated somewhere along the line. There is, for instance, Clouseau's belief that 'night' is a term denoting a particular period of time during which it is normal for people to spend some time asleep, and his belief that people usually prefer to sleep in comfortable surroundings, as well as his belief that hotels generally provide such comfortable surroundings. Similarly, there is Clouseau's belief tht 'morning' is a term denoting a period of time that follows on from night, and his further belief that it is normal in the morning for the people to stop sleeping and resume activity ...\n","\n","Now I could go on here extracting further relevant beliefs, but I expect that the moral is already abundantly clear. And this is the well appreciated (and for researchers in artifical intelligence, frustrating) fact that even relatively simple inferences of this kind require the causal involvement of a large amount of background detail. For while it is certainly true that commonsense psychology does provide us with economical explanations of these sorts of cognitive episodes, these explanations turn out on closer analysis to hinge on a large number of longstanding beliefs that must be brought out in any reasonably thorough account of the causal processing involved. But given that our commonsense framework does acknowledge that these longstanding beliefs are causally active behind the scenes, what does it say about how they make their presence felt? Or to put this another way, does commonsense require that all of these background beliefs are causally implicated in a functionally discrete fashion?\n","\n","I think that it is fairly clear that it doesn't. Insofar as our commonsense understanding provides any elucidation of the causal machinery here at all, the tendency is for us to say that these background beliefs are only 'implicitly' involved. In Clouseau's case, for example, we would say that in the course of making his inference about the butler's deception, he simply 'took for granted' a whole wealth of background detail about hotels, about trains, and so forth. And this seems to suggest that commonsense psychology requires a causal framework in which large numbers of relevant longstanding beliefs are simultaneously brought to bear on a congnitive task, such that Clouseau, for example, can take a lot of information for granted while he makes what for him is a relatively straightforward inference.\n","\n","This conception of the causal dynamics of intentional entities is quite different from that adduced by Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon. They may be right to think that from the commonsense perspective certain of Clouseau's beliefs are causally efficacious in a functionally discrete fashion (we might say this, for instance, about those of his beliefs that consciously occur to him in the course of making his inference), but they are certainly wrong to think that from this perspective all of the relevant beliefs in this cognitive episode are causally efficacious in such a fashion. Instead, as we have just seen, commonsense would seem to require a good deal of causal holism. It would seem to require, that is, a computational framework in which large numbers of relevant beliefs can be causally efficacious without being individually processed.\n","\n","It is at this point, of course, that we can take the line of reasoning that leads from connectionism to eliminativism and turn it on its head. But before we do this, it is instructive, I feel, to briefly consider why Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon feel so strongly inclined to argue that commonsense is committed to universal causal discreteness. The explanation isn't terribly difficult to find, and it is an explanation that, once brought to light, can be turned to our advantage.\n","\n","The explanation is found in the work of Jerry Fodor, perhaps the most wellknown contemporary intentional realist. Fodor is justifiably famous in the field for his attempt to give commonsense psychology a principled basis. He has combined the ontology of commonsense with the causal dynamics of classical computation to come up with what he calls the representational theory of mind (or just RTM) (1976, 1987). And one of the central features of Fodor's RTM is particularly relevant to our discussion here. For as Fodor explains:\n","\n","According to [RTM], mental processes are causal sequences of transformations of mental representations. It follows that tokenings of attitudes must correspond to tokenings of mental representations when they-the attitude tokenings-are episodes in mental processes. If the intentional objects of such causally efficacious attitude tokenings are not explicitly represented, then RTM is simply false. I repeated for emphasis: If the occurrence of a thought is an episode in a mental process, then RTM is committed to the explicit representation of its content. The motto is therefore No Intentional Causation without Explicit Representation (1987, pp. 24-25).\n","\n","I trust that all of this sounds a little familiar. Here in the flesh is Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon's doctrine of universal causal discreteness: intentional entities, according to Fodor's RTM, cannot be causally active unless they are indentifiable with explicit, and therefore functionally discrete, representations in the language of thought. And the point is, of course, that Ramsey, Stich \\& Garon have not distilled this doctrine from commonsense psychology; they have actually distilled it from Fodor's RTM.\n","\n","But RTM is itself only committed to this doctrine because of its commitment in turn to the causal dynamics of the classical computational framework-it is this framework that requires representational entities to be causally efficacious in a functionally discrete fashion. What is more, it is precisely because RTM is committed to the universal causal discreteness entailed by its classical framework that it runs into trouble. The unbridled enthusiasm with which the classical computational framework was received in the 1960s and 1970s has, in the last 10 years or so, been replaced by sobriety and disillusionment as cognitive scientists have found that vast increases in both processing speed and memory capacity have not lead to the much promised computational solutions to even some of the most basic cognitive tasks. The conclusion that many have drawn as a result is that it is just not plausible to suppose that our brains explicitly retrieve and explicitly manipulate a colossal number of discrete symbol structures every time we perform the simplest of inferences. What is required instead, as our analysis of commonsense psychology attests, is a computational framework in which large numbers of representational states, specifically large numbers of longstanding beliefs, can causally influence a cognitive decision without themselves being individually processed. What is required, in short, is a computational framework that, in contrast to classicism, can incorporate a good deal of causal holism.\n","\n","\n","\n","\\end{document}\n","[144]\n","\\section*{2 The problem}\n","Ramsey, Stich and Garon start with the assumption that folk psychology is a theory, and that states such as beliefs, desires and so on are posits of the theory.  They argue that this theory is a prime candidate for replacement because it cannot possibly be telling us all there is to know about psychology. What is crucial to the Folk Psychologist's program, they argue, is the claim of propositional modularity (1991, p. 204). Propositional modularity holds that the propositional attitudes are:\n","\n","\\begin{enumerate}\n","\\item functionally discrete,\n","\\item semantically interpretable, and\n","\\item play a causal role (in mental and behavioral output).\n","\\end{enumerate}\n","\n","Thus, in classical folk psychological models it is clear when a functionally distinct representation such as a belief plays a causal role. But Ramsey, Stich and Garon point out that there are classes of connectionist models that fly in the face of Propositional Modularity. These connectionist models become candidates to replace their folk psychological counterparts.\n","\n","They offer as examples two networks of their own design: Network A and Network B. Both encode simple propositions, such as \"Cats have fur\" and \"Dogs have legs\" with binary strings of length 16 . These binary strings count as input to the 16 input nodes of the network. Four units comprise the hidden unit layer, and there is a single output node which (after training) will register a \" 1 \" (or very close\n","to it) for a true proposition and a \" 0 \" (or very close to it) for a false proposition. Network A was trained on 16 propositions using back propagation until it was accurate at distinguishing true from false in the training set. It then was seen to \"generalize\", for it gave an affirmative answer to the new proposition (not in its training set) \"Cats have legs\", and negatively to the proposition \"Cats have scales\". Network B was just like Network A in architecture, but its training set included one additional proposition, \"Fish have eggs\", for a total of 17 propositions in the training set. Network B performed similarly after training to Network A in accuracy and generalization.\n","\n","In contrast with classical models, say Ramsey, Stich and Garon, connectionist networks like Networks A and B have no distinct states or parts that serve to represent particular propositional contents. Information storage is distributed across the network and is holistic. Following Smolensky (1988), this sort of representation is termed subsymbolic. Thus, any particular unit or weight value can encode information about many different contents.\n","\n","Connectionist models of this sort, they claim, have three properties:(Ramsey et al. 1991, p 207)\n","\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item Their encoding of information in the weights is widely distributed, not localist\n","\\item The individual units have no symbolic interpretation-they are subsymbolic\n","\\item The models are not intended as implementations, but as true (and ontologically radical) cognitive theories that compete with traditional cognitive theories.\n","\\end{itemize}\n","\n","Given the stark contrast between propositional modularity and connectionist models, Ramsey, Stich and Garon remark that:\n","\n","It simply makes no sense to ask whether or not the representation of a particular proposition plays a causal role in the network's computation. It is in just this respect that our connectionist model of memory seems radically incongruent with the propositional modularity of common sense psychology. For ... common sense psychology seems to presuppose that there is generally some answer to the question of whether a particular belief or memory played a causal role in a specific cognitive episode. But if belief and memory are subserved by a connectionist network like ours, such questions seem to have no clear meaning. (Ramsey et al. 1991, p 212).\n","\n","Since connectionist networks lack modular propositional states, they will not have the discrete features required to make them fall under psychological generalizations. Classically, seeing an F generally leads to me believing B, that F. A law connects the object F with my belief B. But according to the analysis given by Ramsey, Stich and Garon, there are no discrete, functionally distinct, belief states or structures like B that are implemented by all the networks that appear to exemplify such beliefs. Thus Network A's belief that F will differ from Network B's belief that F, since the individual weights and unit activations, and hence their internal representations, are necessarily different. They go on to claim that \"these networks have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of connectionist theory\" (Ramsey et al. 1991, p 213).\n","\n","In what follows, I will argue against Ramsey, Stich and Garon to show that neural networks do have states which satisfy the claims $1-3$ of Propositional Modularity. These states can include a conjunction of input, hidden unit, and weight states, as will be discussed below in Sects. 3 and 4. I will then show in Sect. 5 how a proper interpretation of these states relates to the existing literature on Ramsey, Stich and Garon's paper, and avoids eliminativism with respect to belief.\n","\n","[145]\n","\\section*{3 Neural correlates of belief}\n","There is a lot I agree with in the account offered by Ramsey, Stich and Garon above. I agree that encoding in connectionist networks is distributed, and that individual units rarely have a symbolic interpretation. But I do not think that accepting such things means that such networks do not represent at all. There are, I believe, connectionist-and ultimately, neural-correlates of belief.\n","\n","Let me start by debunking a myth. The myth is that neural networks do not have distinct states or parts that serve to represent particular contents. Consider again Networks A and B which were claimed above to lack distinct states that represented particular propositional contents. We seem to have conveniently forgotten the input units here. These represent the propositional contents in a distinct and straightforward way, and they have the added convenience that they are part of the network in question. So it appears the network does represent propositions. It is even a distributed representation, but then the English sentence \"Cats have fur\" is also a distributed representation-distributed across letters-of the proposition, or content, cats have fur.\n","\n","This might appear to be cheating, but it is not. Presumably what connectionist models are going to be useful for is explaining human (and other animal) cognitive phenomena. But humans have their analogues of input units too: the senses and their wiring into the brain. These inputs vary nomically with outside conditions. When an infant and an adult look at a flower, they both have nearly identical retinal, optical tract, optical chiasm, and cortical (V1-V4, say) stimulations. Their retinas, and the rest of their sensory delivery systems, then, carry the same information. This information is distributed: the entire retina may be stimulated, and similarly for the bundles of neurons delivering the signals further downstream in a parallel (and distributed) fashion. The sensory systems for both the infant and adult vary in lawlike, and very similar, ways with the external environment. It is what happens after that information has been picked up-a story to do with learning-which determines what content is available for behavioral output for the agent.  The adult believes the object is a flower, and he can behave in appropriate ways. The infant, on the other hand, lacks the appropriate beliefs; she has not learned about flowers yet. Similarly for a neural network. The information at the input level is a lot like sensory information. It is only after learning that the network can distinguish categories in the training set.\n","It is important to understand the difference between two kinds of physical properties in a neural network. The first kind of property is that which occurs when the units are activated, say by the presentation of an $\\mathbf{F}$. This is a property that occurs at a time. Electrical signals pass through the network upon such a presentation. Consider a network which has learned to recognize F's. The input units will exemplify a characteristic activation pattern, call it $\\mathbf{I}$, corresponding to an $\\mathbf{F}$ when presented with one. Similarly, the output units exemplify a characteristic output pattern, call it $\\mathbf{O}$, upon such a presentation. But also notice that the hidden units exemplify an activation pattern after learning, call it $\\mathbf{H}$. The property $\\mathbf{H}$ exemplified by the hidden units is different from the (learned) final weight configuration, call it $\\mathbf{W}$. The former property $\\mathbf{H}$ is a transient one, it occurs at a time. The latter property is stable; it lasts for more than the moment over which electrical signals stimulate the network to be activated.\n","\n","After learning, the network's hidden units may exemplify two sorts of properties, $\\mathbf{H}$ and $\\mathbf{W}$. Note that these are like the properties of real neurons instantiated in wetware. A collection of neurons may fire in some manner, thus exhibiting a property which is the analogue of an activation pattern $\\mathbf{H}$ in a neural network. A collection of neurons also has the fairly stable property of intersynaptic connections. This property is the analogue of the property $\\mathbf{W}$ in neural networks.\n","\n","We know that after learning, the weight structure $\\mathbf{W}$ becomes a stable, permanent feature of a neural network. Since it is stable, it will not change with different incoming signals. It also is not a property that is exemplified only when an input arrives-it is there over long periods of time whether signals are coming in or not. As such, this is not the sort of property which we would tend to associate with a regularity, such as the regularity which occurs between the input units and outside conditions $\\mathbf{F}$ : When an $\\mathbf{F}$ is presented under the right conditions, a pattern $\\mathbf{I}$ will occur on the input units. As pointed out above, this is the sort of regularity we normally associate with the carrying of information.\n","\n","According to Ramsey et al. (1991, pp. 215-217), neither of the states H or W occurring in networks can be considered to be beliefs or memories. The activation pattern $\\mathbf{H}$ would not do because it is transient, and beliefs are supposed to be enduring. Thus John believes that kangaroos are marsupials even when he is not thinking about kangaroos. The weight structure $\\mathbf{W}$ would not do because they find it extremely implausible that weights encode content in functionally discrete ways. That is, it is unlikely that $\\mathbf{W}$ has discrete encoding properties corresponding to properties in the environment (or a training set). However, they do remark that there might indeed be some system of encoding in the weights that they are unfamilar with. And, \"Moreover we concede that if such a covert system were discovered, then our argument would be seriously undermined\" (Ramsey et al. 1991, p 215). We will return to this point below.\n","\n","Since neither activation patterns nor weight states fit Ramsey, Stich and Garon's criteria for representational states such as beliefs or memories, there are no representational states in neural networks. They have been eliminated in the brave new world of connectionism. As I have said before, though I am sympathetic, I remain unconvinced. In what follows, I propose how we should interpret belief in networks.\n","\n","[146]\n","\\section*{4 Belief in networks}\n","The first thing we should recognize is that the story of belief that has just been told is incomplete. It ignores that beliefs are also causes of output, which can take the form of actions in agents, or output patterns in networks. This is crucial for establishing the third claim of propositional modularity about the causal role of beliefs. A belief must be a physical occurrence of an internal state at a time, which can cause appropriate action at that time. A tree is in front of me and I see it. Because I believe the tree is in front of me, I swerve to the side on my run through the park. Does this mean I have to have an enduring tree-belief? This seems implausible for this sort of perceptual belief. What I need are cognitive capacities for recognizing trees. A tree-recognition neural event-the actual occurrence at a time-is a belief. If this sort of belief was forced to fit in the straightjacket of \"enduring\" beliefs given above, then by having the belief permanently, I would be forever swerving. But I am not. Consider now a neural network that has been taught to recognize trees. It has been fitted with a digital camera front-end which feeds an input layer, and an output layer that drives a speech-synthesizer. It too only responds to trees when presented with one. It says \"tree\". But once it is taught, it does not say \"tree\" all day long-only when one is presented.\n","\n","I do not happen to believe in belief-boxes or grandmother cells. These would be, I presume, places in the brain where particular propositional contents are stored. But one does not need such artifices in order to accommodate belief. If one has a causal notion of belief, then believing $\\mathbf{F}$ is a matter of encountering or perceiving $\\mathbf{F}$ in appropriate circumstances. And the circumstances are given with extreme simplicity in the case of neural networks. They give us a very powerful, mechanistic, and simplified model for what appears to be going on in the brain under certain conditions.\n","\n","The internal circumstances are provided by learning. In Skokowski (2004) I have shown how learning, which involves actual physical encounters with the environment (or training set), is what installs a weight state $\\mathbf{W}$, and determines its contents. These are implicit contents that are acquired naturalistically, and that play a real causal role in the behavior of the network.\n","\n","Without learning, one cannot hope to attain the regularities associated with belief (beyond the information-carrying capacity of the input units). That is, without learning one cannot hope to attain outputs appropriate to the training task: yielding a \" 1 \" when given the proposition \"Cats have Fur\"; saying \"tree\" when presented with a tree; swerving when encountering a tree on a run. Learning, by installing an enduring weight state $\\mathbf{W}$, delivers the background conditions required for an informational state, such as a perceptual or input state, to get an executive capacity and cause output. (Skokowski 2004, pp. 367-368).\n","\n","Before learning, an infant or a neural network may carry information about its surroundings, but neither will yet have a belief, something that can guide its behavioral output. The infant \"sees\" trees, but does not recognize them; does not have beliefs about them. The network \"sees\" trees in its input units, but does not produce the sound \"tree\" in its output. Learning corrects this deficit. Not by changing anything at the input level. The input, or sensory, states still carry informational content in the same way. They covary nomically with external conditions. What is changed is the internal weight state, or neural structure, of the system. Note that the causal work for an occurrent belief or memory is done by the electrical signals in a neural network, or the electro-chemical signals in the brain. This is the transient activation state. But the background weight state $\\mathbf{W}$ acts to modify or guide the signal in a way that produces output appropriate to the input. In this way, weights encode the latent ability to construct states that correspond to occurrent beliefs.\n","\n","Beliefs should cause output when they occur in an agent. Beliefs should be caused by appropriate external conditions. Beliefs should carry representational content. Belief in networks, then, should be seen as the activation pattern occurring in the input and hidden units, after learning. This includes what I earlier called I together with the hidden unit activation pattern $\\mathbf{H}$. Call this combined state $\\mathbf{B}$. It is important that we do not have $\\mathbf{B}$ until after learning. Just like the infant or the neural network, we lack cognitive abilities until we have learned them. So being presented with a tree before learning would not evoke a response appropriate to a belief about trees. But after learning, B causes appropriate output. B is also caused by appropriate external conditions. When presented with the proposition \"Cats have Fur\", Network A registers input 1111000011110000 on its input layer, which in turn causes further activation in the network. When perceiving a tree on a run, the adult swerves. B also carries representational content. This is guaranteed by including the input activation $\\mathbf{I}$ as part of $\\mathbf{B}$. I, through sensory covariation with properties in the environment, carries content. B therefore does by default.\n","\n","[148]\n","\\section*{6 Missing the point: the requirements of wetware}\n","We can now return to the literature on Ramsey, Stich and Garon mentioned at the beginning of this article and see why the various approaches fall short. O'Brien (1991) holds for a broad causal holism for belief in connectionist networks, a holism that denies what he calls \"causal discreteness\". For O'Brien, causal discreteness requires that distinct causal roles can be determined for the various representational elements in a system; and this, he claims, is not plausible for connectionist networks. But the approach offered in this paper does supply distinct causal roles for the representational elements $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{W}$. In addition, the contents for these states can be determined: explicit occurrent contents for states like $\\mathbf{B}$, and, following Skokowski (2004), implicit enduring contents for states like W. Both kinds of states are required for particular actions of a network which we ascribe \"beliefs\" to.\n","\n","Stich's (1991) reply to O'Brien denies the broad causal holism endorsed by O'Brien, arguing that not every belief encoded in a distributed system plays a role in every episode of processing, and I agree with this for the reasons just mentioned: the relevant covariational and encoded contents for particular states $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{W}$ are what are important for a particular episode, and it is these contents which correspond to the folk psychological explanations.\n","\n","Forster and Seidel (1994) put forward a simple network model that they claim proves propositional modularity for a concrete distributed system for both occurrent and enduring belief states, thus showing Ramsey, Stich, and Garon to be wrong about this property with regards to networks. Though sympathetic to Forster and Seidel's goals, I must side with Ramsey's (1994) reply: in essence, the model is too simple to be generally applicable. The encodings offered by this six-node model are localist in nature, and it is difficult to see how to generalize this simple model to massively distributed systems-including, most importantly, wetware.\n","\n","Clark (1995) gives a different approach from O'Brien, Forster and Seidel by placing the representational burden of networks entirely on the shoulders of the weight matrix: \"Connectionist systems thus encode knowledge as complex patterns of positive and negative weights linking up simple processing units\" (Clark 1995, p. 342). As has been emphasized in this article, this approach ignores the direct covariational component of the input states, which carry informational content about external conditions. A robust biological neural model of cognition needs to include the role of the senses as contributing to occurrent beliefs, something which is lacking by placing the entire burden of content storage on enduring weight states.\n","\n","Stich and Warfield's reply accuses Clark of neo-behaviorism, because, they claim, any black box would satisfy Clark's dispositional account of enduring belief encoded in a weight matrix W (Stich and Warfield 1995, p. 403). But this objection would not work against an account like the one already provided in Skokowski (2004) for the contents of weight states. For this account requires an internal, physical state $\\mathbf{W}$ that is installed by learning: that is, a causally efficacious learning history. Such an approach actually fills another requirement of Stich and Warfield: that in order for connectionism to avoid eliminativism, a causal/historical account must be given when determining the contents of these states. This is precisely what is done in Skokowski's (2004) model. Finally, Stich and Warfield still side with Ramsey, Stich and Garon that if connectionist theories are right then eliminativism will be right about the propositional attitudes (Stich and Warfield 1995, p. 409). And that view is what the present paper has been devoted to overturning.\n","\n","A common thread with all these failed approaches is their lack of attention to the requirements of wetware. An important part of biological connectionist systems is that most occurrent beliefs are hooked up with the senses, and further, that learned behavior requires the installation of neural connections through interactions with the environment. Both kinds of representational states-occurrent (activations) and connections (weights) - play a role in behavior, and both can be determined: occurrent states by being activated through covariation with the immediate environment, and connections through their actual and efficacious learning history. By understanding the origins of these states, we can see how individual combinations have a causal role in some episodes, but not in others. And this gives us confidence in ascribing belief to networks.\n","\n","\n","\\end{document}\n","[150]\n","\\section{II}\n","\\\\\n","Without acknowledging it (and thus, perhaps, without realizing it), Ramsey, Stich and Garon's argument for the threat of eliminativism deploys a theme that figures centrally in Donald Davidson's work. Davidson argued, famously, that reasons have to be treated as causes because only in that way can we distinguish between reasons that rationalize an action and reasons that explain it. His point is that there are plenty of occasions where an individual performs an action and has a belief and desire pair that rationalizes that action but where it would be inappropriate to use that belief and desire pair to explain the action. In 'Psychology as Philosophy' (1980), Davidson writes,\n","\n","A desire and a belief of the right sort may explain an action, but not necessarily. A man might have good reason for killing his father, and he might do it, and yet the reasons not be his reasons in doing it (think of Oedipus). So when we offer the fact of the desire and the belief in explanation, we imply not only that the agent had the desire and belief, but that they were efficacious in producing the action (p. 223).\\\\\n","Similarly, in defending the thesis that beliefs and desires are 'causally active', Ramsey Stich and Garon write,\n","\n","In common sense psychology, behavior is often explained by appeal to certain of the agent's beliefs and desires. Thus, to explain why Alice went to her office, we might note that she wanted to send some e-mail messages (and, of course, she believed she could do so from her office). However, in some cases an agent will have several sets of beliefs and desires each of which might lead to the same behavior. Thus we may suppose that Alice also wanted to talk to her research assistant, and that she believed he would be at the office. In such cases, common sense psychology assumes that Alice's going to her office might have been caused by either one of the belief-desire pairs, or by both, and that determining which of these options obtains is an empirical matter. So it is entirely possible that on this occasion Alice's desire to send some e-mail played no role in producing her behavior; it was the desire to talk with her research assistant that actually caused her to go to the office. However, had she not wanted to talk with her research assistant, she might have gone to the office anyhow, because the desire to send some e-mail, which was causally inert in her actual decision making, might than have become actively involved. Note that in this case common sense psychology is prepared to recognize a pair of quite distinct semantically characterized states, one of which may be causally active while the other not (p. 505).\n","\n","As we shall see later, though, while the thrust of the argument is the same as Davidson's, the case described does pose a sterner challenge to one who wishes to deny that folk psychology is committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires than the one Davidson had in mind. Ramsey, Stich and Garon also usefully develop Davidson's idea by extending it to cover cases where we distinguish between a belief that rationalizes another belief and a belief that explains why another belief was formed:\\\\\n","On the common sense view, it may sometimes happen that a person has a number of belief clusters, any one of which might lead him to infer some further belief. When he actually does draw the inference, folk psychology assumes that it is an empirical question what he inferred it from, and that this question typically has a determinate answer. Suppose, for example, that Inspector Clouseau believes that the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel, and that he said he arrived back on the moming train. Suppose Clouseau also believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, and that the morning train has been taken out of service. Given these beliefs, along with some widely shared background beliefs, Clouseau might well infer that the butler is lying. If he does, folk psychology presumes that the inference might be based either on his beliefs about the hotel, or on his beliefs about the train, or both. It is entirely possible, from the perspective of common sense psychology, that although Clouseau has long known that the hotel is closed for the season, this belief played no role in his inference on this particular occasion. Once again we see common sense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert (p. 506).\n","\n","Folk psychology, they conclude, is committed to the thesis that beliefs and desires are causally active. Let us clarify this claim a little on the authors' behalf. Folk psychology does not pretend that one's beliefs and desires are always causally active. Indeed, in the last sentence of the quoted passage above, the authors describe one that is causally inert. What is central to their argument, I think, is the idea that insofar as common sense psychology uses a particular attitude to explain another attitude or action, it is committed to the causal efficacy of that attitude. The explanatory role of folk psychology, then, involves, on their account, a commitment to causally active attitudes.\n","\n","Ramsey, Stich and Garon contend further that according to folk psychology, propositional attitudes are functionally discrete; that is to say, it is always possible that a person acquire or lose particular propositional attitudes without disturbing the rest. There is no attitude you have that couldn't be lost singly. Moreover, for any attitude that, given your set of attitudes, it is possible for you to acquire, you could acquire it without losing any of the original set. They also add to their list of folk psychological commitments the platitude that beliefs and desires have semantic properties.\n","\n","The authors then go on to articulate a type of psychological model that is being taken seriously in contemporary cognitive science which poses a problem for these three folk psychological commitments, considered together. For when one looks at the type of psychological architecture these models describe, it doesn't look as if there are any functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties that correspond to ordinary belief-desire ascriptions.  They concede that we might have been too causal in drawing this conclusion about those models, that there might be \"some covert functionally discrete system of propositional encoding that has yet to be discovered\" (p. 517) in these cognitive architectures, but argue that the burden of argument is on anyone who reckons this likely. For the purposes of this paper, I need not go into the details of the class of so-called 'connectionist' models that Ramsey, Stich and Garon describe, since their details are irrelevant to the points I wish to make.\n","\n","It is clear where they go from here: There is a type of psychological model which may very well be true of us, but which doesn't make room for functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties that correspond to common-sense belief-desire ascriptions. Therefore it may very well be true that we have no functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties that correspond to belief-desire ascription. Folk psychology is committed to the view that beliefs and desires are functionally discrete, causally active states with semantic properties. Therefore, it may very well be true of us that we have no beliefs and desires. For the reason discussed earlier, this conclusion is to be read as not merely the ontological conclusion that beliefs and desires don't exist, but as making the stronger claim that belief-desire ascriptions are not true of us.\n","\n","Now for the refinement. There is a fairly obvious problem for the Davidsonian argument from the need to distinguish rationalizers and explainers to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires. The point is simple. We don't need to recognize the causal efficacy of both beliefs and desires in order to distinguish between explainers and rationalizers. Let me explain. Suppose we concede to Ramsey, Stich and Garon that beliefs are causally active states but chose to construe desires in a dispositional way. Desires, on this view, would be evidenced by how beliefs cause behavior but would not be realized themselves by some causally active, functionally discrete states.\n","\n","Could such an account distinguish between explainers and mere rationalizers? It could very easily. The prima facie problem here is how to distinguish between desires that explain and desires that rationalize. A moment's reflection here reveals the problem to be no more than prima facie. Thinking back to the case that Ramsey, Stich and Garon describe, suppose Alice's belief that she could get e-mail messages sent by going to her office was causally responsible for her going to her office but that her belief that she could talk to her research assistance by going to her office was causally inert. That would license our concluding that it was her desire to send e-mail messages rather than her desire to talk to her research assistant that explains her going to her office, even if there were no isolable, causal active states in her that were identifiable as her desires. In short, one who opts for a dispositionalist account of desires could ground the difference between desires that explain and those that do not in terms of which means/end beliefs are causally active.\n","\n","Of course, we have not yet disarmed the eliminativist in any serious way. The story I have just told requires that there are, at least, some causally active states that deserve the label 'belief'. The thrust of Ramsey, Stich and Garon's paper is that it may well turn out that none of our causally active states deserve being called either beliefs or desires. So even if folk psychology is only committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs, their argument for the threat of eliminativism might yet go through. So we can restate the first premise of the argument as: According to folk psychology, beliefs are causally efficacious, semantically evaluable states that are functionally discrete and an agent has desires only if she has beliefs.\n","\n","While having my doubts about folk psychology's commitment to functional discreteness,  I shall, for the purposes of this paper, concede to Ramsey, Stich and Garon that it is so committed. Further, I shall concede that the type of psychological model that they describe may well be true of us and further, that if it is true of us, then we have no causally efficacious states that can be plausibly regarded as being beliefs or desires. The strand of their argumentation that I wish to focus on concerns the claim that folk psychology is committed to the causal efficacy of beliefs and desires and its use as a basis for inferring that eliminativism is a serious threat.\n","\n","[175]\n","\\section*{REPRESENTATIONAL REDESCRIPTION}\n","Children (and human adults) look to be unlike basic connectionist systems insofar as they seem to be internally driven to form increasingly abstract representations of their own problem solving abilities. Such a hypothesis (discussed at length in Clark and Karmiloff-Smith, in prep.) has been pursued in an influential series of papers (Karmiloff-Smith 1979, 1986, 1987, 1988, forthcoming a, forthcoming b) by Annette Karmiloff-Smith. She argues for a phase-like picture of human cognitive development. Unlike most other animals, humans, she holds, are compelled by endogenous forces to go beyond simple success in a domain and to seek more flexible representations of the strategies that brought success. As she puts it, we go beyond \"behavioural mastery\" and redescribe our functioning procedures in a series of higher level languages. This representational redescription (which may culminate in conscious, verbal access to the constructs involved) is a device that enables the organism to get more mileage out of information that, in a certain sense, it already possesses, courtesy of the functioning procedure. The parallel with our discussion of the Ohm's law network is immediate. It has a kind of behavioral mastery in the domain. But it has not gone beyond that mastery. It is locked into phase one of Karmiloff-Smith's picture. The completed picture involves a number of phases, some of which will be detailed later. For now, we need only stress the coarsest details, namely:\n","\n","Basic Mastery: The system has a means of negotiating the problem domain. But the procedure is heavily dependent on external inputs and, as far as the organism is concerned, unstructured.\n","\n","Higher Level Re-descriptions: The functioning procedure is treated as a new problem domain and is thus theorised about (unconsciously) by the organism. This theorising results in the organism redescribing the procedure underlying its basic mastery in a series of higher level languages and may result, at the topmost level, in conscious access to our problem solving procedures in the domain. (KarmiloffSmith 1986, pp. 102-103)\n","\n","Notice at this point an essential feature of the account. The lower level descriptions and procedures do not get destroyed as higher ones become available. Instead they remain intact and may be deployed whenever appropriate. Karmiloff-Smith has tested the broad lines of the hypothesis in a number of experiments involving vary varied problem domains (ranging from knowledge of the article system (Karmiloff-Smith, 1986) to knowledge of physical causality (Karmiloff-Smith, 1988). I shall describe a single, illustrative experiment concerning children's drawing. The experiment, detailed in Karmiloff-Smith (forthcoming a) involved children of two age groups, 4-6 and 8-10. They were asked to draw (a) a house, then (b) a \"funny house\" (or a \"house that doesn't exist\" and so on; various locutions were used, and precautions were taken to ensure that the instructions were understood).\n","\n","The hypothesis was that at first the children would have a basic mastery in the domain of house drawing but would not have developed higher level redescriptions of this and hence would exhibit various limitations in their drawing behavior.\n","\n","Children of all ages could draw a basic house. The interesting data concerns:\n","\n","\\begin{enumerate}\n","\\item A small number of younger children who seemed unable to draw a funny house (thus suggesting a pure un-redescribed competence), and perhaps more importantly,\n","\\item the striking differences between the kinds of alteration to the basic house exhibited by children of different ages (suggesting various constraints operative at different phases of redescription.)\n","\\end{enumerate}\n","\n","Thus a small number of children seemed unable to carry out the command to draw a house that doesn't exist, whereas others (by hypothesis, those who had formed a higher level, \"chunked\" representation of their own basic procedure) could indeed produce strange houses-ones lacking doors, or with extra windows, or with the relative location of doors and windows reversed, or even with elements from other categories (e.g., a piece of a ship) inserted. There proved to be a developmental sequence in the type of alteration produced such that the following developmental order of changes was observed:\\\\\n","(a) Shape and size of parts changed, (b) shape of whole changed, (c) deletion of elements, (d) insertion of new elements, (e) position/orientation changed, and (f) insertion of cross-category elements.\n","\n","It turned out that children of all ages (in the successful class) were able to make changes of types (a) to (c), but only children in the older age group (8-10) were generally able to make changes of types (d) to (f). (See Karmiloff-Smith, forthcoming b.) How is this to be explained?\n","\n","A boring hypothesis, Karmiloff-Smith (forthcoming b) suggests is that the younger ones simply had not thought of the more subtle changes. An exciting hypothesis is that due to the way their knowledge was represented, the younger ones were actually incapable of making such changes. To decide between the two, a follow-up experiment was conducted. In the follow-up experiment eight of the younger subjects who had made only changes of types (a) to (c) were asked to draw two pictures involving the other types of change. One picture was to be of a man with two heads (an insertion change) and the other was to be of a house with wings (a cross-category change). All eight rapidly and fluently drew the house with wings, but seven out of the eight made a revealing \"error\" in the other task. Instead of drawing a man with two heads they drew one body and head, drew a second head and then:\n","\n","\\begin{quotation}\n","went on laboriously and very slowly to draw two bodies, two arms and legs on each body etc., i.e. they used a complete man drawing procedure for each head and then kept starting again because dissatisfied with the result. They had similar difficulties simply copying a model provided by the experimenter and succeeded only very laboriously and slowly. By contrast, when other $8-10$ year olds interrupted sequential order to insert a new sub-routine for drawing a second head, they continued drawing a single body with the speed of their normal drawing procedure. (Karmiloff-Smith, forthcoming b, p. 15)\n","\\end{quotation}\n","\n","The failure of the children to fluently produce a two-headed figure is prima facie evidence that it is not simple lack of imagination that underlies the differences between two age groups. But the winged house case then begins to look anomalous. Karmiloff-Smith (forthcoming b) suggests that to explain the data we need to consider the constraints that operate at the first level of representational redescription. At this point, she speculates, the initial procedure responsible for basic mastery in the domain has been redescribed as a \"sequentially fixed list,\" thus as it were inheriting a constraint from the bare procedural level. Such redescription is said to enable the child to \"introduce variables on size and shape.\" But the constraint on sequential order of elements remains. In the case of the man with two heads the child is required to interrupt this sequential order and this is very hard to achieve. By contrast the wings can be added to a completed house drawing sequence and this addition is thus relatively easy. The key data thus concerns the relative ease of production.\n","\n","On the basis of the follow-up experiment, then, Karmiloff-Smith postulates the following structure within the class of successful attempts at \"funny-X drawing.\" First, a phase in which we have sequentially constrained redescription (the young ones capable of drawing a fluent winged house but not a fluent twoheaded man). Second, a phase in which the sequential constraint is lifted (the older ones capable of fluent drawing with mid-routine inserts).\n","\n","It is worth stressing that this is not intended as a model of stages in child development. Rather it is intended as a model of recurrent phases that attend even adult learning. Thus Karmiloff-Smith suggests that adult learning in a phonological awareness task fits the model she proposes, as does the acquisition of musical skills (e.g., learning to play the piano where we begin by learning to play a piece in sequence and have to start at the beginning, and progress to being able to start in the middle of the piece and (perhaps) end up able to play \"variations on a theme, changing all aspects of the sequential order, introducing insertions and so forth\" (forthcoming b).\n","\n","The general model of phases of learning that has emerged is therefore as follows:\n","\n","Phase 1: Basic Mastery via a \"functioning procedure\":\\\\\n","Phase 2: Redescription subjects to sequential constraint;\\\\\n","Phase 3: Redescription with sequential constraint relaxed.\n","\n","What we have, in effect, is a model of expertise that challenges the one recently developed by Paul Smolensky (1988). In Smolensky's model the expert appears as someone who, though perhaps beginning with classical style representations underpinning their competence, uses these phases merely to bootstrap her way to a novice competence. True expertise is achieved only by programming (by prolonged experience and practice in the domain) a connectionist network to carry out the task. (For full details, see Smolensky, 1988 sect. 2.) But the availability of a trained network is, on Karmiloff-Smith's model, sufficient only for the kind of expertise we find in, say, the Ohm's law network. Real human expertise involves a kind of flexibility and creativity (e.g., the ability to draw a \"funny house\") that, she believes, is suggestive of a more classical level of representation coexisting with the fast, efficient connectionist procedure. Smolensky's model, we may say, is a model of animal expertise only.\n","\n","The idea, then, is that the older children are able to treat the problem domain as a fully plastic one. They have available representations that are sufficiently modular and systematically manipulable to allow the selection of elements from the domains, the systematic re-arrangement of elements, the interrupting of the drawing at any given point, and so on. This kind of plasticity seems to call for the more modular and recombinable representations associated (see Fodor \\& Pylyshyn, 1988) with classical approaches.\n","\n","In sum, the conjecture is that human expertise is subserved by a multilevel cognitive architecture in which fast, efficient but somewhat limited connectionist representations are responsible for much daily on-line processing, but trickier situations are catered to by representations of a more classical nature. Thus it is suggested that only the Phase 1 style representations are plausibly treated as connectionist representations, and that the ascent to higher levels of redescription constitutes a progression between classical representational formalisms culminating perhaps in a full-blooded Fodorian language of thought. (See Karmiloff-Smith, 1987, p. 10.) At the very least, we require some form of representation (either classical OR of some yet to be discovered but recognizably connectionist kind) in which the elements of rules are functionally discrete, that is, capable of systematic transformations of the kind described.\n","\n","The thrust of our brief excursion into developmental psychology (for a sustained treatment see Clark and Karmiloff-Smith, in prep.) is therefore this: that systems in which problem solutions are effective (as in the basic house-drawing procedure) but not yet made in some sense explicit are intrinsically limited. The limitations are due to the inability of such systems to treat the problem solution as a structured object capable of being systematically amended. Whether the treatment of a problem solution as a structured object demands classical internal representation or simply some more sophisticated use of connectionist resources remains unclear. It is also unclear whether the idea of explicit representation is itself a purely functional notion; that is, whether any suitably manipulable item should be counted as explicit. What does seem clear, however, is that the child who is unable to draw a \"funny house\" is in a similar position to the Ohm's law network that is unable to deal with a deviant domain in which $V=C+R$. Radical flexibility-the ability to rapidly adapt to a systematically altered set of domain rules-is purchased only by making the emergent rules explicit, available for systematic reconfiguration by other processors. Structured knowledge (both of data and rules) buys flexibility in plastic domains. Emergent, unstructured knowledge buys flexibility in a static domain. The all-round cognizer had better (pace the evangelists of both connectionism and classicism) be capable of both.\n","\n","[195]\n","\\section*{3. PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES AND COMMON SENSE PSYCHOLOGY}\n","For present purposes we will assume that common sense psychology can plausibly be regarded as a theory, and that beliefs, desires and the rest of the propositional attitudes are plausibly viewed as posits of that theory. Though this is not an uncontroversial assumption, the case for it has been well argued by others.  Once it is granted that common sense psychology is indeed a theory, we expect it will be conceded by almost everyone that the theory is a likely candidate for replacement. In saying this, we do not intend to disparage folk psychology, or to beg any questions about the status of the entities it posits. Our point is simply that folk wisdom on matters psychological is not likely to tell us all there is to know.\\\\\n","differences in theory are enough to justify the suspicion that there has been an ontologically radical change. Toward the other end are writers like Lycan, who writes:\n","\n","I am at pains to advocate a very liberal view . . . I am entirely willing to give up fairly large chunks of our commonsensical or platitudinous theory of belief or of desire (or of almost anything else) and decide that we were just wrong about a lot of things, without drawing the inference that we are no longer talking about belief or desire . . I think the ordinary word \"belief\" (qua theoretical term of folk psychology) points dimly toward a natural kind that we have not fully grasped and that only mature psychology will reveal. I expect that \"belief\" will turn out to refer to some kind of information bearing inner state of a sentient being . . ., but the kind of state it refers to may have only a few of the properties usually attributed to beliefs by common sense. (Lycan (1988), pp. 31-2.)\n","\n","On our view, both extreme positions are implausible. As we noted earlier, the Copernican revolution did not show that the planets studied by Ptolemy do not exist. But Lavosier's chemical revolution did show that phlogiston does not exist. Yet on Lycan's \"very liberal view\" it is hard to see why we should not conclude that phlogiston really does exist after all-it's really oxygen, and prior to Lavosier \"we were just very wrong about a lot of things\".\\\\\n","For an early and influential statement of the view that common sense psychology is a theory, see Sellars (1956). More recently the view has been defended by Churchland (1970) \\& (1979), Chs. 1 \\& 4; and by Fodor (1988), Ch. 1. For the opposite view, see Wilkes (1978); Madell (1986); Sharpe (1987).\n","\n","Common sense psychology, like other folk theories, is bound to be incomplete in many ways, and very likely to be inaccurate in more than a few. If this were not the case, there would be no need for a careful, quantitative, experimental science of psychology. With the possible exception of a few die hard Wittgensteinians, just about everyone is prepared to grant that there are many psychological facts and principles beyond those embedded in common sense. If this is right, then we have the first premise needed in an eliminativist argument aimed at beliefs, propositional memories and the rest of the propositional attitudes. The theory that posits the attitudes is indeed a prime candidate for replacement.\n","\n","Though common sense psychology contains a wealth of lore about beliefs, memories, desires, hopes, fears and the other propositional attitudes, the crucial folk psychological tenets in forging the link between connectionism and eliminativism are the claims that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behavior. Following the suggestion in Stich (1983), we'll call this cluster of claims propositional modularity.  (The reader is cautioned not to confuse this notion of propositional modularity with the very different notion of modularity defended in Fodor (1983).)\n","\n","There is a great deal of evidence that might be cited in support of the thesis that folk psychology is committed to the tenets of propositional modularity. The fact that common sense psychology takes beliefs and other propositional attitudes to have semantic properties deserves special emphasis. According to common sense:\\\\\n","i. when people see a dog nearby they typically come to believe that there is a dog nearby; ii. when people believe that the train will be late if there is snow in the mountains, and come to believe that there is snow in the mountains, they will typically come to believe that the train will be late; iii. when people who speak English say 'There is a cat in the yard,' they typically believe that there is a cat in the yard.\n","\n","And so on, for indefinitely many further examples. Note that these generalizations of common sense psychology are couched in terms of the semantic properties of the attitudes. It is in virtue of being the belief that $p$ that a given belief has a given effect or cause. Thus common sense psychology treats the predicates expressing these semantic properties, predicates like 'believes that the train is late,' as projectable predicates-the sort of predicates that are appropriately used in nomological or law-like generalizations.\n","\n","Perhaps the most obvious way to bring out folk psychology's commitment tothe thesis that propositional attitudes are functionally discrete states is to note that it typically makes perfectly good sense to claim that a person has acquired (or lost), a single memory or belief. Thus, for example, on a given occasion it might plausibly be claimed that when Henry awoke from his nap he had completely forgotten that the car keys were hidden in the refrigerator, though he had forgotten nothing else. In saying that folk psychology views beliefs as the sorts of things that can be acquired or lost one at a time, we do not mean to be denying that having any particular belief may presuppose a substantial network of related beliefs. The belief that the car keys are in the refrigerator is not one that could be acquired by a primitive tribesman who knew nothing about cars, keys or refrigerators. But once the relevant background is in place, as we may suppose it is for us and for Henry, it seems that folk psychology is entirely comfortable with the possibility that a person may acquire (or lose) the belief that the car keys are in the refrigerator, while the remainder of his beliefs remain unchanged. Propositional modularity does not, of course, deny that acquiring one belief often leads to the acquisition of a cluster of related beliefs. When Henry is told that the keys are in the refrigerator, he may come to believe that they haven't been left in the ignition, or in his jacket pocket. But then again he may not. Indeed, on the folk psychological conception of belief it is perfectly possible for a person to have a long standing belief that the keys are in the refrigerator, and to continue searching for them in the bedroom.\n","\n","To illustrate the way in which folk psychology takes propositional attitudes to be functionally discrete, causally active states let us sketch a pair of more elaborate examples.\\\\\n","i) In common sense psychology, behavior is often explained by appeal to certain of the agent's beliefs and desires. Thus, to explain why Alice went to her office, we might note that she wanted to send some e-mail messages (and, of course, she believed she could do so from her office). However, in some cases an agent will have several sets of beliefs and desires each of which might lead to the same behavior. Thus we may suppose that Alice also wanted to talk to her research assistant, and that she believed he would be at the office. In such cases, common sense psychology assumes that Alice's going to her office might have been caused by either one of the belief/desire pairs, or by both, and that determining which of these options obtains is an empirical matter. So it is entirely possible that on this occasion Alice's desire to send some e-mail played no role in producing her behavior; it was the desire to talk with her research assistant that actually caused her to go to the office. However, had she not wanted to talk with her research assistant, she might have gone to the office anyhow, because the desire to sent some e-mail, which was causally inert in her actual decision making, might then have become actively involved. Note that in this case com-mon sense psychology is prepared to recognize a pair of quite distinct semantically characterized states, one of which may be causally active while the other is not.\\\\\n","ii) Our second illustration is parallel to the first, but focuses on beliefs and inference, rather than desires and action. On the common sense view, it may sometimes happen that a person has a number of belief clusters, any one of which might lead him to infer some further belief. When he actually does draw the inference, folk psychology assumes that it is an empirical question what he inferred it from, and that this question typically has a determinate answer. Suppose, for example, that Inspector Clouseau believes that the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel, and that he said he arrived back on the morning train. Suppose Clouseau also believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, and that the morning train has been taken out of service. Given these beliefs, along with some widely shared background beliefs, Clouseau might well infer that the butler is lying. If he does, folk psychology presumes that the inference might be based either on his beliefs about the hotel, or on his beliefs about the train, or both. It is entirely possible, from the perspective of common sense psychology, that although Clouseau has long known that the hotel is closed for the season, this belief played no role in his inference on this particular occasion. Once again we see common sense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert.\n","\n","In the psychological literature there is no shortage of models for human belief or memory which follow the lead of common sense psychology in supposing that propositional modularity is true. Indeed, prior to the emergence of connectionism, just about all psychological models of propositional memory, save for those urged by behaviorists, were comfortably compatible with propositional modularity. Typically, these models view a subject's store of beliefs or memories as an interconnected collection of functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states which interact in systematic ways. Some of these models represent individual beliefs as sentence-like structures-strings of symbols which can be individually activated by transferring them from long term memory to the more limited memory of a central processing unit. Other models represent beliefs as a network of labeled nodes and labeled links through which patterns of activation may spread. Still other models represent beliefs as sets of production rules.  In all three sorts of models, it is generally the case that for any given cognitive episode, like performing a particular inference or answering a question, some of the memory states will be actively involved, and others will be dormant.In Figure 9.1. we have displayed a fragment of a \"semantic network\" representation of memory, in the style of Collins \\& Quillian (1972). In this model, each distinct proposition in memory is represented by an oval node along with its labeled links to various concepts. By adding assumptions about the way in which questions or other sorts of memory probes lead to activation spreading through the network, the model enables us to make predictions about speed and accuracy in various experimental studies of memory. For our purposes there are three facts about this model that are of particular importance. First, since each proposition is encoded in a functionally discrete way, it is a straightforward matter to add or subtract a single proposition from memory, while leaving the rest of the network unchanged. Thus, for example, Figure 9.2. depicts the result of removing one proposition from the network in Figure 9.1. Second, the model treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of beliefs or memories as projectable.  They are treated as the sorts of predicates that pick out scientifically genuine kinds, rather than mere accidental conglomerates, and thus are suitable for inclusion in the statement of lawlike regularities. To see this, we need only consider the way in which such models are tested against empirical data about memory acquisition and forgetting. Typically, it will be assumed that if a subject is told (for example) that the policeman arrested the hippie, then the subject will (with a certain probability) remember that the policeman arrested the hippie.  And this assumption is taken to express a nomological generalization-it captures something lawlike about the way in which the cognitive system works. So while the class of people who remember that the policeman arrested the hippie may differ psychologically in all sorts of ways, the theory treats them as a psychologically natural kind. Third, in any given memory search or inference task exploiting a semantic network model, it makes sense to ask which propositions were activated and which were not. Thus, a search in the network of Figure 1 might terminate without ever activating the proposition that cats have paws.\n","\n","[196]\n","\\section*{4. A FAMILY OF CONNECTIONIST HYPOTHESES}\n","Our theme, in the previous section, was that common sense psychology is committed to propositional modularity, and that many models of memory proposed in the cognitive psychology literature are comfortably compatible with this assumption. In the present section we want to describe a class of connectionist models which, we will argue, are not readily compatible with propositional modularity. The connectionist models we have in mind share three properties:\\\\\n","i. their encoding of information in the connection weights and in the biases on units is widely distributed, rather than being localist;ii. individual hidden units in the network have no comfortable symbolic interpretation; they are subsymbolic, to use a term suggested by Paul Smolensky; iii. the models are intended as cognitive models, not merely as implementations of cognitive models.\n","\n","A bit later in this section we will elaborate further on each of these three features, and in the next section we will describe a simple example of a connectionist model that meets our three criteria. However, we are under no illusion that what we say will be sufficient to give a sharp-edged characterization of the class of connectionist models we have in mind. Nor is such a sharp-edged characterization essential for our argument. It will suffice if we can convince you that there is a significant class of connectionist models which are incompatible with the propositional modularity of folk psychology.\n","\n","Before saying more about the three features on our list, we would do well to give a more general characterization of the sort of models we are calling \"connectionist,\" and introduce some of the jargon that comes with the territory. To this end, let us quote at some length from Paul Smolensky's lucid overview.\n","\n","Connectionist models are large networks of simple, parallel computing elements, each of which carries a numerical activation value which it computes from neighboring elements in the network, using some simple numerical formula. The network elements or units influence each other's values through connections that carry a numerical strength or weight . . .\n","\n","In a typical . . . model, input to the system is provided by imposing activation values on the input units of the network; these numerical values represent some encoding or representation of the input. The activation on the input units propagates along the connections until some set of activation values emerges on the output units; these activation values encode the output the system has computed from the input. In between the input and output units there may be other units, often called hidden units, that participate in representing neither the input nor the output.\n","\n","The computation performed by the network in transforming the input pattern of activity to the output pattern depends on the set of connection strengths; these weights are usually regarded as encoding the system's knowledge.  In this sense, the connection strengths play the role of the program in a conventional computer. Much of the allure of the connectionist approach is that many connectionist networks program themselves, that is, they have autonomous procedures for tuning their weights to eventually perform some specific computation. Such learning procedures often depend on training in which the network is presented with sample input/output pairs from the function it is supposed to compute. In learning networks with hidden units, the network itself \"decides\" what computations the hidden units will perform; because these units represent neither inputs nor outputs, they are never \"told\" what their values should be, even during training. . . .14One point must be added to Smolensky's portrait. In many connectionist models the hidden units and the output units are assigned a numerical \"bias\" which is added into the calculation determining the unit's activation level. The learning procedures for such networks typically set both the connection strengths and the biases. Thus in these networks the system's knowledge is usually regarded as encoded in both the connection strengths and the biases.\n","\n","So much for a general overview. Let us now try to explain the three features that characterize those connectionist models we take to be incompatible with propositional modularity.\\\\\n","(i) In many non-connectionist cognitive models, like the one illustrated at the end of Section 3, it is an easy matter to locate a functionally distinct part of the model encoding each proposition or state of affairs represented in the system. Indeed, according to Fodor and Pylyshyn, \"conventional [computational] architecture requires that there be distinct symbolic expressions for each state of affairs that it can represent.\"  In some connectionist models an analogous sort of functional localization is possible, not only for the input and output units but for the hidden units as well. Thus, for example, in certain connectionist models, various individual units or small clusters of units are themselves intended to represent specific properties or features of the environment. When the connection strength from one such unit to another is strongly positive, this might be construed as the system's representation of the proposition that if the first feature is present, so too is the second. However, in many connectionist networks it is not possible to localize propositional representation beyond the input layer. That is, there are no particular features or states of the system which lend themselves to a straightforward semantic evaluation. This can sometimes be a real inconvenience to the connectionist model builder when the system as a whole fails to achieve its goal because it has not represented the world the way it should. When this happens, as Smolensky notes, [I]t is not necessarily possible to localize a failure of veridical representation. Any particular state is part of a large causal system of states, and failures of the system to meet goal conditions cannot in general be localized in any particular state or state component.\"16\n","\n","It is connectionist networks of this sort, in which it is not possible to isolate the representation of particular propositions or states of affairs within the nodes, connection strengths and biases, that we have in mind when we talk about the encoding of information in the biases, weights and hidden nodes being widely distributed rather than localist.\\\\\n","(ii) As we've just noted, there are some connectionist models in which some or all of the units are intended to represent specific properties or features of thesystem's environment. These units may be viewed as the model's symbols for the properties or features in question. However, in models where the weights and biases have been tuned by learning algorithms it is often not the case that any single unit or any small collection of units will end up representing a specific feature of the environment in any straightforward way. As we shall see in the next section, it is often plausible to view such networks as collectively or holistically encoding a set of propositions, although none of the hidden units, weights or biases are comfortably viewed as symbols. When this is the case we will call the strategy of representation invoked in the model subsymbolic. Typically (perhaps always?) networks exploiting subsymbolic strategies of representation will encode information in a widely distributed way.\\\\\n","(iii) The third item on our list is not a feature of connectionist models themselves, but rather a point about how the models are to be interpreted. In making this point we must presuppose a notion of theoretical or explanatory level which, despite much discussion in the recent literature, is far from being a paradigm of clarity.  Perhaps the clearest way to introduce the notion of explanatory level is against the background of the familiar functionalist thesis that psycholgoical theories are analogous to programs which can be implemented on a variety of very different sorts of computers.  If one accepts this analogy, then it makes sense to ask whether a particular connectionist model is intended as a model at the psycholgoical level or at the level of underlying neural implementation. Because of their obvious, though in many ways very partial, similarity to real neural architectures, it is tempting to view connectionist models as models of the implementation of psychological processes. And some connectionist model builders endorse this view quite explicitly. So viewed, however, connectionist models are not psychological or cognitive models at all, any more than a story of how cognitive processes are implemented at the quantum mechanical level is a psycholgoical story. A very different view that connectionist model builders can and often do take is that their models are at the psychological level, not at the level of implementation. So construed, the models are in competition with other psychological models of the same phenomena. Thus a connectionist model of word recognition would be an alternative to-and not simply a possible implementation of-a non-connectionist model of word recognition; a connectionist theory of memory would be a competitor to a semantic network theory, and so on. Connectionists who hold this view of their theories often illustrate the point by drawing analogies with other sciences. Smolensky, for example, suggests that connectionist models stand to traditional cognitive models (like semantic networks) in much the same way that quantum mechanics stands to classical me-chanics. In each case the newer theory is deeper, more general and more accurate over a broader range of phenomena. But in each case the new theory and the old are competing at the same explanatory level. If one is right, the other must be wrong.\n","\n","In light of our concerns in this paper, there is one respect in which the analogy between connectionist models and quantum mechanics may be thought to beg an important question. For while quantum mechanics is conceded to be a better theory than classical mechanics, a plausible case could be made that the shift from classical to quantum mechanics was an ontologically conservative theory change. In any event, it is not clear that the change was ontologically radical. If our central thesis in this paper is correct, then the relation between connectionist models and more traditional cognitive models is more like the relation between the caloric theory of heat and the kinetic theory. The caloric and kinetic theories are at the same explanatory level, though the shift from one to the other was pretty clearly ontologically radical. In order to make the case that the caloric analogy is the more appropriate one, it will be useful to describe a concrete, though very simple, connectionist model of memory that meets the three criteria we have been trying to explicate.\n","\n","[197]\n","\\section*{5. A CONNECTIONIST MODEL OF MEMORY}\n","Our goal in constructing the model was to produce a connectionist network that would do at least some of the tasks done by more traditional cognitive models of memory, and that would perspicuously exhibit the sort of distributed, sub-symbolic encoding described in the previous section. We began by constructing a network, we'll call it Network A, that would judge the truth or falsehood of the sixteen propositions displayed above in line in Figure 9.3. The network was a typical three tiered feed-forward network consisting of 16 input units, four hidden units and one output unit, as shown in Figure 9.4. The input coding of each proposition is shown in the center column in Figure 9.3. Outputs close to 1 were interpreted as 'true' and outputs close to zero were interpreted as 'false'. Back propagation, a familiar connectionist learning algorithm was used to \"train up\" the network thereby setting the connection weights and biases. Training was terminated when the network consistently gave an output higher than .9 for each true proposition and lower than .1 for each false proposition. Figure 9.5 shows the connection weights between the input units and the leftmost hidden unit in the trained up network, along with the bias on that unit. Figure 9.6 indicates the connection weights and biases further upstream. Figure 9.7 shows the way in which the network computes its response to the proposition Dogs have fur when that proposition is encoded in the input units.\n","\n","There is a clear sense in which the trained up Network A may be said to have stored information about the truth or falsity of propositions (1)-(16), since when any one of these propositions is presented to the network it correctly judges whether the proposition is true or false. In this respect it is similar to various semantic network models which can be constructed to perform much the same task. However, there is a striking difference between Network A and a semantic network model like the one depicted in Figure 9.1. For, as we noted earlier, in the semantic network there is a functionally distinct sub-part associated with each proposition, and thus it makes perfectly good sense to ask, for any probe of the network, whether or not the representation of a specific proposition played a causal role. In the connectionist network by contrast, there is no distinct state or part of the network that serves to represent any particular proposition. The information encoded in Network A is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network. Whenever information is extracted from Network A, by giving it an input string and seeing whether it computes a high or a low value for the output unit, many connection strengths, many biases and many hidden units play a role in the computation. And any particular weight or unit or bias will help to encode information about many different propositions. It simply makes no sense to ask whether or not the representation of a particular proposition plays a causal role in the network's computation. It is in just this respect that our connectionist model of memory seems radically incongruent with the propositional modularity of common sense psychology. For, as we saw in Section 3, common sense psychology seems to presuppose that there is generally some answer to the question of whether a particular belief or memory played a causal role in a specific cognitive episode. But if belief and memory are subserved by a connectionist network like ours, such questions seem to have no clear meaning.\n","\n","The incompatibility between propositional modularity and connectionist models like ours can be made even more vivid by contrasting Network A with a second network, we'll call it Network B, depicted in Figures 9.8 and 9.9. Network B was trained up just as the first one was, except that one additional proposition was added to the training set (coded as indicated below the line in Figure 3). Thus Network B encodes all the same propositions as Network A plus one more. In semantic network models, and other traditional cognitive models, it would be an easy matter to say which states or features of the system encode the added proposition, and it would be a simple task to determine whether or not the representation of the added proposition played a role in a particular episode modeled by the system. But plainly in the connectionist network those questions are quite senseless. The point is not that there are no differences between the two networks. Quite the opposite is the case; the differences are many and widespread. But these differences do not correlate in any systematic way with the functionally discrete, semantically interpretable states posited by folk psychology and by more traditional cognitive models. Since information is encoded in a highly distributed manner, with each connection weight and bias embodying information salient to many propositions, and information regarding any given proposition scattered throughout the network, the system lacks functionally dis- tinct, identifiable sub-structures that are semantically interpretable as representations of individual propositions.\n","\n","The contrast between Network A and Network B enables us to make our point about the incompatibility between common sense psychology and these sorts of connectionist models in a rather different way. We noted in Section 3 that common sense psychology treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of propositional attitudes as projectable. Thus 'believes that dogs have fur' or 'remembers that dogs have fur' will be projectable predicates in common sense psychology. Now both Network A and Network B might serve as models for a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur; both networks store or represent the information that dogs have fur. Nor are these the only two. If we were to train up a network on the 17 propositions in Figure 9.3 plus a few (or minus a few) we would get yet another system which is as different from Networks A and B as these two are from each other. The moral here is that though there are indefinitely many connectionists networks that represent the information that dogs have fur just as well as Network A does, these networks have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of connectionist theory. From the point of view of the connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind at all, but simply a chaotically disjunctive set. Common sense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a psychologically natural kind; connectionist psychology does not.\n","\n","[198]\n","\\section*{6. OBJECTIONS AND REPLIES}\n","The argument we've set out in the previous five sections has encountered no shortage of objections. In this section we will try to reconstruct the most interesting of these, and indicate how we would reply.\n","\n","Objection (i): Models like A and B are not serious models for human belief or propositional memory.\n","\n","Of course, the models we've constructed are tiny toys that were built to illustrate the features set out in Section 4 in a perspicuous way. They were never intended to model any substantial part of human propositional memory. But various reasons have been offered for doubting that anything like these models could ever be taken seriously as psychological models of propositional memory. Some critics have claimed that the models simply will not scale up-that while teaching a network to recognize fifteen or twenty propositions may be easyenough, it is just not going to be possible to train up a network that can recognize a few thousand propositions, still less a few hundred thousand.  Others have objected that while more traditional models of memory, including those based on sentence-like storage, those using semantic networks, and those based on production systems, all provide some strategy for inference or generalization which enables the system to answer questions about propositions it was not explicitly taught, models like those we have constructed are incapable of inference and generalization. It has also been urged that these models fail as accounts of human memory because they provide no obvious way to account for the fact that suitably prepared humans can easily acquire propositional information one proposition at a time. Under ordinary circumstances, we can just tell Henry that the car keys are in the refrigerator, and he can readily record this fact in memory. He doesn't need anything like the sort of massive retraining that would be required to teach one of our connectionist networks a new proposition.\n","\n","Reply: If this were a paper aimed at defending connectionist models of propositional memory, we would have to take on each of these putative shortcomings in some detail. And in each instance there is at least something to be said on the connectionist side. Thus, for example, it just is not true that networks like $A$ and B don't generalize beyond the propositions on which they've been trained. In Network A, for example, the training set included:\n","\n","Dogs have fur Cats have fur.\\\\\n","Dogs have paws Cats have paws.\\\\\n","Dogs have fleas Cats have fleas.\\\\\n","It also included\n","\n","Dogs have legs.\\\\\n","but not\\\\\n","Cats have legs.\\\\\n","When the network was given an encoding of this last proposition, however, it generalized correctly and responded affirmatively. Similarly, the network responded negatively to an encoding of\n","\n","Cats have scales though it had not previously been exposed to this proposition.\\\\\n","However, it is important to see that this sort of point by point response to thecharge that networks like ours are inadequate models for propositional memory is not really required, given the thesis we are defending in this paper. For what we are trying to establish is a conditional thesis: if connectionist models of memory of the sort we describe in Section 4 are right, then propositional attitude psychology is in serious trouble. Since conditionals with false antecedents are true, we win by default if it turns out that the antecedent of our conditional is false.\n","\n","Objection (ii): Our models do not really violate the principle of propositional modularity, since the propositions the system has learned are coded in functionally discrete ways, though this may not be obvious.\n","\n","We've heard this objection elaborated along three quite different lines. The first line-let's call it Objection (iia)-notes that functionally discrete coding may often be very hard to notice, and can not be expected to be visible on casual inspection. Consider, for example, the way in which sentences are stored in the memory of a typical von Neuman architecture computer-for concreteness we might suppose that the sentences are part of an English text and are being stored while the computer is running a word processing program. Parts of sentences may be stored at physically scattered memory addresses linked together in complex ways, and given an account of the contents of all relevant memory addresses one would be hard put to say where a particular sentence is stored. But nonetheless each sentence is stored in a functionally discrete way. Thus if one knew enough about the system it would be possible to erase any particular sentence it is storing by tampering with the contents of the appropriate memory addresses, while leaving the rest of the sentences the system is storing untouched. Similarly, it has been urged, connectionist networks may in fact encode propositions in functionally discrete ways, though this may not be evident from a casual inspection of the trained up network's biases and connection strengths.\n","\n","Reply (iia): It is a bit difficult to come to grips with this objection, since what the critic is proposing is that in models like those we have constructed there might be some covert functionally discrete system of propositional encoding that has yet to be discovered. In response to this we must concede that indeed there might. We certainly have no argument that even comes close to demonstrating that the discovery of such a covert functionally discrete encoding is impossible. Moreover, we concede that if such a covert system were discovered, then our argument would be seriously undermined. However, we're inclined to think that the burden of argument is on the critic to show that such a system is not merely possible but likely; in the absence of any serious reason to think that networks like ours do encode propositions in functionally discrete ways, the mere logical possibility that they might is hardly a serious threat.\n","\n","The second version of Objection (ii)â€”we'll call it Objection (iib)â€”makes a specific proposal about the way in which networks like A and B might be discretely, though covertly, encoding propositions. The encoding, it is urged, is to be found in the pattern of activation of the hidden nodes, when a given proposition is presented to the network. Since there are four hidden nodes in our networks, the activation pattern on presentation of any given input may be represented as an ordered 4-tuple. Thus, for example, when network $A$ is presented with the encoded proposition Dogs have fur, the relevant 4-tuple would be (21, 75, 73, 12), as shown in Figure 9.7. Equivalently, we may think of each activation pattern as a point in a four dimensional hyperspace. Since each proposition corresponds to a unique point in the hyperspace, that point may be viewed as the encoding of the proposition. Moreover, that point represents a functionally discrete state of the system.\n","\n","Reply (iib): What is being proposed is that the pattern of activation of the system on presentation of an encoding of the proposition $p$ be identified with the belief that $p$. But this proposal is singularly implausible. Perhaps the best way to see this is to note that in common sense psychology beliefs and propositional memories are typically of substantial duration; and they are the sorts of things that cognitive agents generally have lots of even when they are not using them. Consider an example. Are kangaroos marsupials? Surely you've believed for years that they are, though in all likelihood this is the first time today that your belief has been activated or used.  An activation pattern, however, is not an enduring state of a network; indeed, it is not a state of the network at all except when the network has had the relevant proposition as input. Moreover, there is an enormous number of other beliefs that you've had for years. But it makes no sense to suppose that a network could have many activation patterns continuously over a long period of time. At any given time a network exhibits at most one pattern of activation. So activation patterns are just not the sorts of things that can plausibly be identified with beliefs or their representations.\n","\n","Objection (iic): At this juncture, a number of critics have suggested that long standing beliefs might be identified not with activation patterns, which are transient states of networks, but rather with dispositions to produce activation patterns. Thus, in network A, the belief that dogs have fur would not be identified with a location in activation hyperspace but with the network's disposition to end up at that location when the proposition is presented. This dispositional state is an enduring state of the system; it is a state the network can be in no matter what its current state of activation may be, just as a sugar cube may have a disposition to dissolve in water even when there is no water nearby.  Some have gone on to suggest that the familiar philosophical distinction between dispositional and occurrent beliefs might be captured, in connectionist models, as the distinction between dispositions to produce activation patterns and activation patterns themselves.Reply (iic): Our reply to this suggestion is that while dispositions to produce activation patterns are indeed enduring states of the system, they are not the right sort of enduring states-they are not the discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires. Recall that on the folk psychological conception of belief and inference, there will often be a variety of quite different underlying causal patterns that may lead to the acquisition and avowal of a given belief. When Clouseau says that the butler did it, he may have just inferred this with the help of his long standing belief that the train is out of service. Or he may have inferred it by using his belief that the hotel is closed. Or both long standing beliefs may have played a role in the inference. Moreover, it is also possible that Clouseau drew this inference some time ago, and is now reporting a relatively long standing belief. But it is hard to see how anything like these distinctions can be captured by the dispositional account in question. In reacting to a given input, say $p$, a network takes on a specific activation value. It may also have dispositions to take on other activation values on other inputs, say $q$ and $r$. But there is no obvious way to interpret the claim that these further dispositions play a causal role in the network's reaction to $p$-or, for that matter, that they do not play a role. Nor can we make any sense of the idea that on one occasion the encoding of $q$ (say, the proposition that the train is out of service) played a role while the encoding of $r$ (say, the proposition that the hotel is closed) did not, and on another occasion, things went the other way around. The propositional modularity presupposed by common sense psychology requires that belief tokens be functionally discrete states capable of causally interacting with one another in some cognitive episodes and of remaining causally inert in other cognitive episodes. However, in a distributed connectionist system like Network A, the dispositional state which produces one activation pattern is functionally inseparable from the dispositional state which produces another. Thus it is impossible to isolate some propositions as causally active in certain cognitive episodes, while others are not. We conclude that reaction pattern dispositions won't do as belief tokens. Nor, so far as we can see, are there any other states of networks like A and $B$ that will fill the bill. plausibly be identified. If these models turn out to offer the best accounts of human belief and memory, we will be confronting an ontologically radical theory change-the sort of theory change that will sustain the conclusion that propositional attitudes, like caloric and phlogiston, do not exist.\n","\n","[213]\n","\\section*{AN INVITATION TO ELIMINATIVISM}\n","If all this is right, then what seems to be in prospect is an argument from connectionism to eliminativism; not, to be sure, to the elimination of all semantic content, but to the elimination of the bearers of semantic content that belong in the common sense scheme: beliefs, and thoughts in general.\n","\n","The present argument for a tension between the common sense scheme and the connectionist program finds a parallel in the chapter by Ramsey, et al. (this volume). They defend a conditional claim: \"If connectionist hypotheses . . . turn out to be right, so too will eliminativism about propositional attitudes.\"\n","\n","Their argument comes in two main stages. First, they claim that the common sense scheme is committed to propositional modularity. This is the idea that: \"propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, states that play a causal role in the production of other attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behavior.\"\n","\n","Then, second, they claim that distributed connectionist networks do not exhibit propositional modularity.\n","\n","The argument of the present chapter is likewise an argument for an incompatibility between a feature of the common sense scheme and connectionist hypotheses.\n","\n","Ramsey et al. argue: Networks do not exhibit propositional modularity; the common sense scheme is committed to propositional modularity; therefore connectionism is opposed to the common sense scheme. Similarly, the argument of this chapter runs: Networks do not exhibit syntax and causal systematicity of process; the common sense scheme is committed to syntax and causal systematicity of process; therefore connectionism is opposed to the common sense scheme.\n","\n","The parallel extends to some points of detail. Ramsey et al. argue that in a connectionist network there are no functionally autonomous vehicles of proposition-sized semantic contents. In the case where the putative vehicles under consideration are patterns of weights, their point is essentially similar to the claim that processing in networks is not causally systematic. This is hardly surprising. For suppose we focus on the role of beliefs in mediating between desires and action, or in mediating inferentially between other beliefs. Then what propositional modularity requires is that there should be functionally autonomous transition mediators. And that is also what is required if the several transitions-from desire to action, or from belief to belief-are to be causally systematic.\n","\n","Each argument purports to establish a necessary condition for a being to be a thinker (a believer, a deployer of concepts). In each case, this necessary condition concerns internal cognitive architecture; it is a condition that is far from being guaranteed by facts about behavior. For any given being whose behavior prima facie warrants the attribution to it of beliefs and other attitudes, in accordance with the intentional stance, it is a genuine epistemic possibility that the being does not meet the condition on internal architecture.\n","\n","In each argument, connectionism serves to provide a vivid example on which to focus what is a quite general issue. For, in each case, it is claimed that a being whose internal cognitive architecture is correctly described as a connectionist network will not meet the necessary condition for being a thinker that the argument purports to establish.\n","\n","The general issue that connectionism brings so sharply into focus is this. Is it philosophically acceptable that a a priori argument should render it epistemically possible that we should turn out not to be believers or thinkers? One powerful source of resistance to our argument for the LOT hypothesis is precisely the thought that this is not acceptable; that it is built into our very conception of a believer or thinker that we are the paradigm exemplars. According to that view, the proposition that we are believers is philosophically non-negotiable.\n","\n","In fact, it is more or less inevitable that philosophers who have any Wittgensteinian sympathies at all will feel some unease about our argument. Order might proceed, so to speak, out of chaos; and it might proceed out of order. It is an $a$ posteriori matter which of these two is the case. Part of the message of Zettel (Wittgenstein, 1981) is, perhaps, that philosophers have no business insisting that the system must \"continue further in the direction of the centre.\" And the invitation to eliminativism then presents itself as the penalty for failing to heed that message.\n","\n","However, despite the virulence of these doubts, we can fortify ourselves with two thoughts. First, it is possible to mount a defence against eliminativism without rejecting our argument. Second, blanket immunity against eliminativism is only purchased at an exorbitant price. These two claims will be defended briefly in the next (and final) section.\n","\n","[214]\n","\\section*{DEFENDING BELIEF}\n","There are at least two broad ways of mounting a defence against eliminativism, while accepting our argument for the LOT hypothesis; but one can be dismissed quite rapidly.\n","\n","The first way is to adopt an a prioristic stance towards the future of science. According to this first defensive strategy, we should allow that evidence might build up in favour of the hypothesis that our internal cognitive architecture does not meet the conditions that, according to our argument, are necessary for being a believer. This is to say that it is conceivable that we should amass evidence such that, all else equal, the best explanation of that evidence would be that the LOT hypothesis is false. But in that situation we should then say that all else is not equal, and that in this case we have reason to maintain that what would otherwise be the best explanation of the evidence is not, in fact, the correct explanation.\n","\n","If our argument for the LOT hypothesis had been an a posteriori argument, then this would be a viable strategy. Indeed, in the face of a strong a posteriori argument, the claim that evidence might pile up against the LOT hypothesis would appear question-begging. But given that the original argument is a priori, this first strategy is surely just an unjustifiable refusal to accept an inference to the best explanation.\n","\n","So, in the context of an invitation to eliminativism issuing from an a priori argument, this first defensive strategy is not to be recommended.\n","\n","The second defensive strategy against eliminativism involves a pincer movement.\n","\n","For one component of the movement, we can return to a posteriori considerations in favour of the LOT hypothesis. These can be used to support the view that it is empirically unlikely that the behavior that we find could be reliably forthcoming without an internal architecture measuring up to the requirements of the LOT. Thus, a posteriori arguments for the LOT are not rendered dialectically redundant by our proposal for an a priori argument.\n","\n","In fact, a posteriori arguments for the LOT can be divided into two types. There are some arguments which take the form of a \"How else?\" challenge. As we have seen, in the context of a developing alternative paradigm such as connectionism, this type of argument is apt to seem question-begging.\n","\n","But there are other arguments involving detailed evaluation of the performance of connectionist models that depart from the paradigm of rules and representations, systematicity and syntax. Suppose that analysis of the performance of networks were to uncover aspects that are attributable to the departure from systematicity and syntax, and that conspicuously differ from human performance. Then that would count against connectionism ever becoming the dominant paradigm for modeling human cognitive processes.\n","\n","This idea of an aspect of a network's performance that is attributable to the departure from systematicity and syntax can be illustrated as follows.\n","\n","The distinction between causally systematic processes and others is drawn in such a way that it can, in principle, be used to distinguish between two systems with the same input-output relation. However, in real cases, it is overwhelmingly likely that a departure from causal systematicity will show up somewhere in a system's input-output relation; particularly if we probe the system's operation by presenting novel inputs.\n","\n","Thus-to use the familiar example of the past tense (Rumelhart \\& McClelland, 1986)-suppose that the transitions from regular verbs to their past tenses have a common causal explanation: There is a common mechanism that mediates those several transitions. It follows that the input states for such verbs must have some common property (a symbol meaning that the verb is regular) to engage that common mechanism. If a new verb is presented then, provided that the input state has that same property (tokens the symbol meaning that the verb is regular), the verb will be awarded a past tense in just the same way as all other regular verbs.\n","\n","The situation will be very different if there is only a family resemblance among the transitions for various regular verbs. In such a case, the family resemblance is dictated by similarities among input states, where those states are patterns of activation over units that individually respond to microfeatures of some kind. If a new verb is presented, then the transition to a past tense is conditioned by the microfeatural similarity of the new verb to others. If the new verb is microfeaturally very different from other regular verbs, then it is likely to be awarded a past tense in a very different way.\n","\n","Thus, the highly deviant treatment of novel verbs that are microfeaturally remote from familiar examples-which is an aspect of the performance of the Rumelhart and McClelland network-is attributable to the departure from the rules and representations paradigm. If it turns out that human performance conspicuously differs from that of the network in this respect-as Pinker and Prince (1988) argue that it does-then that lends some non-question-begging support to the \"How else?\" challenge.\n","\n","So much for the first component of the pincer movement.\\\\\n","For the other component of the movement, we can point out that connectionist networks that do not as such employ syntactically structured vehicles of semantic content are susceptible to analyses of their internal operation, such as cluster analysis or receptive field analysis. We can argue that, in some cases, these analyses vindicate higher levels of description at which we find a system that does meet the requirements of the LOT, even though the system is realized in a connectionist substructure.\n","\n","In some other cases, the analyses reveal that the network can be regarded as composed of two devices. One is a front end recognition device that is connectionist through and through. The second is a device that does-at some level of description-meet the requirements of the LOT, and that takes as inputs the outputs of the recognition network.\n","\n","In short, the requirements of syntax and systematicity are typically not met at the level of description of networks in terms of units and connections, activation, and weights. But that does not rule out the possibility that some analysis of the operation of a network may vindicate a higher level of description from whose point of view the approximate and blurred commonalities are just variable realizations of real commonalities. (See Clark, 1989, 1990; Davies, 1990b, 1990c).\n","\n","So much, very briefly, for the second component of the pincer movement.\\\\\n","If successful, this pincer movement renders it highly probable that we are actually believers; or, more accurately, renders it highly probable that we meet the particular necessary condition uncovered by our a priori argument.\n","\n","Thus, the tension between the connectionist program and the common sense scheme can be reduced. But it is not altogether removed. For there is no absolute guarantee that, if we turn out to have connectionist networks inside our heads, then they will be networks that meet the requirements of syntax and systematicity (or of propositional modularity) at some vindicated level of description. We must live with the prospect that empirical discoveries about cognitive architecture may come into conflict with our common sense conception of ourselves.\n","\n","[225]\n","\\section*{Functionally Discrete}\n","We have seen earlier that unity of function does not entail morphological salience. The lack of morphological salience for representations is not itself a problem for RHF.\n","\n","More concretely, as Ramsey et al. (this volume) concede in anticipating a similar reply, \"functionally discrete coding may often be very hard to notice, and can not be expected to be visible on causal inspection.\" For example, a conventionally programmed home computer stores sentences (say, the English sentences being manipulated by a word processor) in a physically scattered way, utilizing widely disparate memory addresses inscrutably linked; if one asks even an expert technician where the computer has stored a particular sentence (such as \"With a gasp of relief, Reg unstrapped the slab of raw liver from his left shin\"), the technician will have not the faintest idea, and will doubt that the question has any crisply factual answer. Yet the sentence is stored in a functionally discrete way; a few keystrokes' worth of input can perform a teleologically defined word-processing operation on that very sentence qua sentence, such as moving it, underlining it, checking its spelling, or making it a separate paragraph.\n","\n","But Ramsey et al. (this volume) are unimpressed:\\\\\n","[W]e're inclined to think that the burden of argument is on the [RHFist] critic to show that such a[n as yet undiscovered] system [of propositional encoding in a global connectionist network] is likely; in the absence of any serious reason to think that networks like ours do encode propositions in functionally discrete ways, the mere logical possibility that they might is hardly a serious threat.\n","\n","Ramsey, Stich, and Garon's request for some positive evidence is reasonable, but overstated. The hypothesis of physically scattered but functionally discrete representation is not just a \"mere logical possibility,\" for as we have seen, ordinary digital computers already work that way, and there is no reason to think that any reasonably powerful computer will ever work in any other way.\n","\n","Granted, conventional computers work that way because (as we already know) they have been programmed from the top down with rules and representations, whereas connectionist networks are not programmed at all in the same sense, but are trained up using general learning algorithms. Yet even in connectionist systems, morphological salience has a way of actually turning up when one least expects it, at higher levels of organization.\n","\n","Consider the Chomskyan argument that wherever there is unbounded competence but only finite resources, there must be a recursion on a finite stock ofprimitives. This principle applies pretty obviously to language understanding, and Fodor and Pylyshyn apply it also to the \"productivity\" of thinking. Now, connectionist architecture might be put forward as a genuinely alternative, competing way of getting unbounded competence from finite resources. (This would be a very radical and important suggestion, given the enormous power and persuasiveness of Chomsky's original argument.) But it is still hard to see how connectionist architecture alone could do that. Take a case of a subject's hearing a long, novel sentence and immediately producing an equally complex and contextually appropriate utterance in response. Our Connectionist would have to maintain that the response was mediated by the activation pattern on the system's hidden units but that no mental morphemes or semantic primitives could be abstracted from the activation pattern itself. This total nonabstractability is very unlikely. Consider the example of NETtalk, a connectionist program that (after training) audibly pronounces English words given written text (Rosenberg, 1987; Rosenberg and Sejnowski, 1987).\n","\n","NETtalk's accomplishment is very impressive, because in paradigmatically connectionist style, (a) the task is very quirky, the actual function from English spelling to oral pronunciation being highly irregular; (b) the function is also many-many rather than one-one or many-one, because the pronunciation of a given letter or letter-group varies fluidly with lexical context; and most notably for our purposes, (c) the machine is explicitly given no rules of phonology, nor representations that look like linguistic rules of any kind, but only a general and topic-neutral learning algorithm that adjusts various activation levels between word-presentation trials. At first the feat seems like magic. And philosophically, to some, it seems like a Rylean/Wittgensteinian dream come true-intelligent, highly intelligent, behavior unmediated by representations and rules.\n","\n","However: As is well known, mature NETtalk activation patterns at the hidden layer are found to be partitioned into disjoint classes. There are 79 of those classes, and as many people have pointed out, this is no accident; they correspond to the 79 distinct letter-to-phoneme moves that are mastered by a normal competent speaker of English. Now it also turns out, under a cluster analysis carried out by Rosenberg and Sejnowski (1987) that involved grouping by similarity along certain parameters and averaging of values, that the 79 classes are also grouped into two main superclasses and various hierarchically organized subdivisions of those. The two main superclasses correspond to the vowels and consonants of English, and the subdivisions (again, made on the basis of a general similarity metric) correspond to familiar vowel and consonant subtypes. Thus, out fall all the phonemes of English phonology. Though NETtalk is handed no phonological rules by its creators, it acquires phonological categories in the process of learning its job, and, we may say counterfactually, it would not have achieved its extraordinary accomplishment had it not acquired those categories. It is still extraordinary, as well, that the categories cannot in any simple way be read off the raw graphological input; nonetheless NETtalk acquires them, and accordingly, it seems to me natural to ascribe phonological concepts to NETtalk (though one may quibble over what rich computational properties a feature of a system might be required to have in order to count as a bonafide concept).\n","\n","In similar wise, one would expect, the familiar morphemes would fall out of a connectionist syntax and semantics for a general natural-language-understanding machine. And this expectation is reinforced by the known psychological robustness of morphemes in humans.  Of course, the natural-language-understanding capacity is a clear (indeed degenerately clear) case of a \"languagelinked\" capacity.\n","\n","As I said earlier, I am far from suggesting that the Implementation thesis holds universally, that is, that every connectionist network exhibits higher-level organization in terms of propositional representation. I am predicting that this will generally be true of systems whose inputs, outputs and correction feedback are understood in semantical terms, and probably also true of other language-linked capacities.\n","\n","[226]\n","\\section*{Distinctive Causal Powers}\n","Even if connectionist networks harbor functionally discrete albeit scattered representations, are those items not too diffusely scattered to have distinctive causal powers? That depends on one's view of causation. A scattered representation is not a billiard ball or a lever. However, a scattered representation does have counterfactual and other subjunctive properties, and if we allow that certain packets of subjunctive properties can suffice to make a genuinely though modestly causal role, then the door is left open on the claim that scattered representations have distinctive causal powers.\n","\n","Notice as well that despite the truth of Ramsey, Stich, and Garon's (this volume) contention that common sense awards beliefs distinctive causal roles, common sense also does not treat beliefs as billiard balls or levers either; a belief is not portrayed by folk wisdom as a mechanical part of a person. It is not that Erica's belief pushed on part C, which activated engine E, and so on. The intuitive causal role of a belief is instead \"modest,\" described only subjunctively: For example, Erica would not have bothered to come to the meeting if she had not thought the Provost would be there. So a scattered representation's lack of a palpable, robust cog-like causal role is by itself no embarrassment to the RHFist's identification of a belief with it.\n","\n","More positively, there is some evidence that NETtalk and more powerful kindred systems (say linguistic ones generally) would exhibit subjunctive properties of the right sort. Suppose two such systems are very similar but slightly different in their I-O relations; perhaps the only very noticeable difference is that one system responds sensibly to an input sentence that the other ignores. Now,the linguistic properties of the two systems supervene on their respective connectionist architectures, and in particular their actual and subjunctive linguistic differences do. So there would have to be at least systematic subjunctive differences in the two activation patterns, however holistically the subjunctive differences would need to be characterized; no I-O difference without a structural difference. Because the I-O difference in question is characterized strictly syntactically/semantically, it is very likely that the underlying structural difference would occupy some syntactic/semantical niche also. (Recall the Chomskyan argument; the systematic subjunctive differences would presumably constitute differences of semantic elements. Jay Rosenberg has pointed out in conversation that in the case of human language, the back-propagation of error used to train up connectionist networks is conducted in semantic terms, for example, by misunderstanding or by correction.)\n","\n","NETtalk again serves as an example: If NETtalk did not acquire its phonological categories aforementioned, then (in light of supervenience) its mature activation patterns would have to have been otherwise; and were its mature activation patterns significantly otherwise, NETtalk would not produce the impressive outputs it does. Thus, on at least one modest subjunctive notion of causality, NETtalk's phonological categories are causally involved in the production of its output.\n","\n","Similar remarks apply to Ramsey et al.'s own example (this volume) of Network A and Network B, which (as regards output) differ only in that B encodes a single proposition additional to those encoded by A. Raising the question of whether B 's representation of the additional proposition has played a causal\\_role in the production of some particular output, Ramsey et al. (this volume) insist that it is \"quite senseless,\" for there is no \"identifiable\" substructure that is B's representation. Whether or not the representation is epistemically \"identifiable,\" Ramsey et al. have shown neither that it is metaphysically nonexistent nor that it does not have a \"modest\" subjunctive-causal role as, according to common sense, beliefs do. Very likely-again by supervenience-B would not display the uncontroversially identifiable extra semantic capacity it does if the scattered representation of the extra proposition did not exist.\n","\n","In passing, Ramsey et al. raise a third issue closely related both to functionally discrete and to distinctive causal powers: that of natural kinds. They note that beliefs are commonsensically supposed to comprise a natural kind, and that belief predicates are accordingly projectible in well-behaved generalizations (this volume). ${ }^{28} \\mathrm{HF}$ and certainly RHF agree that they do and they do. Nor do I see that even a globalist Connectionism must reject that claim, for it is only thatbelief is a well-behaved type of state (not: a type of well-behaved state), and even if individual beliefs are ill-behaved scattered representations, they are ill-behaved and scattered and representations in generally the same ways. What is really at issue is whether the doxastic generalizations of folk psychology \"are couched in terms of the semantic properties of the attitudes\" (Ramsey et al., this volume, italics original).\n","\n","But the latter question again splits into two: that of whether \"belief that $P$ \" is a natural kind, and that of whether beliefs do their causing in virtue of their exact propositional contents or truth-conditions. Those are distinct questions. The first will be answered affirmatively if there exists an adequate \"psychosemantics\" in the sense of Fodor (1987, 1990), that is, a systematic naturalistic explication of mental reference or \"aboutness\".  By contrast, the second would be highly vexed even if a handsome psychosemantics were firmly secured; for although propositional and/or truth-conditional contents may figure in robust generalizations, the generalizations in which they figure need not be causal generalizations about individual bodily movements in response to stimuli. Indeed, contra Fodor's (1980) own seminal article, I take the lesson of the now huge methodological solipsism literature  to be that although beliefs are (however \"modestly\") causes, they do not do their causing specifically by virtue of their propositional contents. If that is right, then neither HF nor RHF as I understand it has any quarrel with Connectionism on that score.\n","\n","[243]\n","\\section*{Connectionism and the Propositional Attitudes}\n","While it is generally agreed that if our future complete cognitive theory is classical, folk psychology stands a reasonable chance of being vindicated, there is much less agreement about the implications for folk psychology if connectionism wins the computational war. Much of the controversy has focused on Ramsey, Stich, and Garon (RS\\&G) (1990), who argue the following: \"If connectionist hypotheses of the sort we will sketch turn out to be right, so too will eliminativism about propositional attitudes\" (p. 500).\n","\n","The \"sort\" they have in mind are distributed, superpositional networks intended as models at the psychological level - that is, models that explain psychological data at a level of description that abstracts away from the specific neuroanatomy or neurophysiology of the brain. To say that a network is \"distributed\" is to say that the information contained in a single proposition is stored in the connection strengths and biases of numerous units. To say that it is \"superpositional\" is to say that those very same connection strengths and unit biases store the information associated with more than one proposition.  For ease of discussion, let us refer to this sort of connectionist network as a \"connectionist* network.\" By \"eliminativism about propositional attitudes,\" RS\\&G mean, not that reference to the propositional attitudes will actually be dispensed with in our folk psychological practices, but that it will turn out that propositional attitudes do not exist. It is important to note that the conclusion RS\\&G are arguing for is a conditional one. They give no reasons to support the claim that our future complete cognitive theory will consist of a distributed, superpositional connectionist network (although they may think this). Rather, they are only interested in arguing that if cognitive science turns out in this way, then things look bleak for folk psychology.\n","\n","What justifies this conditional, according to RS\\&G? Basically, their argument is this: According to folk psychology, propositional attitudes are characterized by a cluster of three features that RS\\&G call \"propositional modularity.\" The problem is that if we examine the sort of connectionist* networks that might be expected to contain propositional attitude-like states, we do not find states with any of these features. Hence if our future complete cognitive theory turns out to be connectionist*, we will be forced to conclude that propositional attitudes do not exist. Although this is the argument at the most general level, the strategy is to focus on a more specific case and assume that the argument will generalize. In fact, RS\\&G discuss only one propositional attitude-belief-and two particular sample connectionist* networks.\n","\n","Not everyone has been convinced. Some philosophers have questioned whether folk psychology is committed to the propositional attitudes being propositionally modular in all of the ways RS\\&G need for their argument (Bechtel and Abrahamsen, 1993; Bogdan, 1993; Botterill, 1994; Clark, 1995). Others have questioned the claim that connectionist* networks are not propositionally modular in the requisite ways (Forster and Saidel, 1994; Botterill, 1994; Clark, 1995; Smolensky, 1995). Still others have criticized some of the argument's inferential steps (Egan, 1995; Stich and Warfield, 1995). Although many of these replies contain legitimate points, there is room for an additional response. In the first place, with the exception of Clark (1995), the complexity of RS\\&G's argument has not generally been appreciated. Upon close examination, RS\\&G's overall argument turns out to be comprised of three subarguments, one for each of the features of propositional modularity. The argument reconstructions offered in the literature tend to focus on one or at most two of these subarguments. Second, because the three strands of the argument have not been kept sufficiently apart, there has been some confusion over exactly what the three features of propositional modularity are supposed to be. In particular, as we will see, with respect to the feature of semantic interpretability, not enough attention has been paid to the question of what kinds folk psychology assumes there to be, and what kinds connectionist* networks allow.\n","\n","The purpose of this chapter is thus to present the case against RS\\&G in a systematic way, with attention to all three of the subarguments. In the course of building this systematic case, I will have occasion to sort through both the various critical points made to date and the responses to them by RS\\&G (where these exist). I will also be adding a few wrinkles of my own. The bottom line, however, will be that even though many of RS\\&G's critics have missed some of the subtleties of RS\\&G's argument, their assessment has been roughly correct. If our future cognitive theory turns out to be connectionist*, nothing follows regarding the existence of the propositional attitudes.\n","\n","[244]\n","\\section*{Setting the Stage}\n","Let us then look at RS\\&G's argument more closely. To do so, we need to examine four things: (1) what the two sample connectionist* networks are like, (2) what it means to be a network that might be expected to contain belieflike states, (3) what propositional modularity comes to, and (4) why connectionist* networks that might be expected to contain belieflike states do not, in fact, contain them, according to RS\\&G.\n","\n","\\begin{enumerate}\n","\\item To make their case, RS\\&G construct two sample connectionist* networks. Network A is designed to \"judge\" the truth or falsity of sixteen propositions such as dogs have fur, dogs have paws, cats have paws, fish have eggs, and so forth. It is a three-tiered, feed-forward network consisting of sixteen input units, four hidden units, and one output unit. The input coding for each proposition is a sequence of sixteen 0s and ls. For example, the input coding for dogs have fur is 11000011 00001111. RS\\&G interpret an output close to 1 as meaning that the presented proposition was judged to be true and an output close to 0 as meaning that the proposition was judged to be false. The network was \"trained up\" by means of backwards propagation until it consistently gave an output greater than .9 for true propositions and an output of less than .1 for false propositions. The second network, Network B, is similar to Network A except that it encodes one additional proposition. Like Network A, B was designed to \"judge\" the truth or falsity of a presented proposition, contains four hidden units, and was trained up by backwards propagation.\n","\\item RS\\&G's argument relies crucially on the idea that among the myriad possible distributed, superpositional connectionist networks, there is a class of networks in which it would be natural to find belieflike states, if such states exist. A belieflike state is a state that has the sort of propositional content and plays roughly the sort of functional role beliefs are generally taken to have. The latter is determined by the various folk psychological generalizations that involve beliefs (for example, that beliefs in combination with desires lead to the formation of intentions to act). RS\\&G do not really have much to say about this particular class of networks in general. Instead, they simply focus on their two sample networks that, in a crude way, model one of the capacities in which it would be natural to find belieflike states - the capacity to judge whether one or another of a specific group of propositions is true or false. Executing this capacity presumably involves beliefs (if beliefs exist), because the folk psychological explanation of how we are able to judge the truth or falsity of a presented proposition would typically be that we judge a proposition $p$ to be true if we believe $p$, and we judge $p$ to be false if we believe that it is not the case that $p$. Consider now the many cognitive capacities that, at the folk psychological level, we would explain, at least partly, by claiming that the subject had one or more beliefs. Call these our \"belief capacities.\" We can then say that the networks RS\\&G are interested in consist of the class of connectionist* networks that purport to account for one or another of these belief capacities.\n","\\item Another key component of RS\\&G's argument is the claim that propositional attitudes exhibit a cluster of features they call \"propositional modularity.\" Propositional modularity comes to this: \"Propositional attitudes are functionally discrete, semantically interpretable, states that play a causal role in the production of other propositional attitudes, and ultimately in the production of behavior\" (RS\\&G, 1990, p. 504). Each of these components is initially characterized in fairly natural folk psychological terms, although, as we shall see, when RS\\&G proceed to give their argument, the notion of functional discreteness, at least, begins to take on certain architectural dimensions.\n","\\end{enumerate}\n","\n","Here is what RS\\&G say initially about the components of propositional modularity:\n","\n","Functional discreteness\n","It typically makes perfectly good sense to claim that a person has acquired (or lost) a single memory or belief. Thus, for example, on a given occasion it might plausibly be claimed that when Henry awoke from his nap he had completely forgotten that the car keys were hidden in the refrigerator, though he had forgotten nothing else. (1990, p. 504)\n","\n","Semantic interpretability\n","[The] generalizations of common sense psychology are couched in terms of the semantic properties of the attitudes. It is in virtue of being the belief that $p$ that a given belief has a given effect or cause. Thus common sense psychology treats the predicates expressing these semantic properties, predicates like \"believes that the train is late,\" as projectable predicates - the sort of predicates that are appropriately used in nomological or law-like generalizations. (1990, p. 504)\n","\n","Independent causal role\n","On the common sense view, it may sometimes happen that a person has a number of belief clusters, any one of which might lead him to infer some further belief. When he actually does draw the inference, folk psychology assumes that it is an empirical question what he inferred it from, and that this question typically has a determinate answer. Suppose, for example, that Inspector Clouseau believes that the butler said he spent the evening at the village hotel, and that he said he arrived back on the morning train. Suppose Clouseau also believes that the village hotel is closed for the season, and that the morning train has been taken out of service. Given these beliefs, along with some widely shared background beliefs, Clouseau might well infer that the butler is lying. If he does, folk psychology presumes that the inference might be based either on his beliefs about the hotel, or on his beliefs about the train, or both. It is entirely possible, from the perspective of common sense psychology, that although Clouseau has long known that the hotel is closed for the season, this belief played no role in his inference on this particular occasion. Once again we see common sense psychology invoking a pair of distinct propositional attitudes, one of which is causally active on a particular occasion while the other is causally inert. (1990, p. 506)\n","\n","RS\\&G also give an example of a case in which folk psychology explains why some action occurred on the basis of a particular set of beliefs and desires, where, however, the agent had more than one belief-desire set that could have resulted in the action.\\\\\n","4.

A FAMILY OF CONNECTIONIST HYPOTHESES}\n","Our theme, in the previous section, was that common sense psychology is committed to propositional modularity, and that many models of memory proposed in the cognitive psychology literature are comfortably compatible with this assumption. In the present section we want to describe a class of connectionist models which, we will argue, are not readily compatible with propositional modularity. The connectionist models we have in mind share three properties:\\\\\n","i. their encoding of information in the connection weights and in the biases on units is widely distributed, rather than being localist;ii. individual hidden units in the network have no comfortable symbolic interpretation; they are subsymbolic, to use a term suggested by Paul Smolensky; iii. the models are intended as cognitive models, not merely as implementations of cognitive models.\n","\n","A bit later in this section we will elaborate further on each of these three features, and in the next section we will describe a simple example of a connectionist model that meets our three criteria. However, we are under no illusion that what we say will be sufficient to give a sharp-edged characterization of the class of connectionist models we have in mind. Nor is such a sharp-edged characterization essential for our argument. It will suffice if we can convince you that there is a significant class of connectionist models which are incompatible with the propositional modularity of folk psychology.\n","\n","Before saying more about the three features on our list, we would do well to give a more general characterization of the sort of models we are calling \"connectionist,\" and introduce some of the jargon that comes with the territory. To this end, let us quote at some length from Paul Smolensky's lucid overview.\n","\n","Connectionist models are large networks of simple, parallel computing elements, each of which carries a numerical activation value which it computes from neighboring elements in the network, using some simple numerical formula. The network elements or units influence each other's values through connections that carry a numerical strength or weight . . .\n","\n","In a typical . . . model, input to the system is provided by imposing activation values on the input units of the network; these numerical values represent some encoding or representation of the input. The activation on the input units propagates along the connections until some set of activation values emerges on the output units; these activation values encode the output the system has computed from the input. In between the input and output units there may be other units, often called hidden units, that participate in representing neither the input nor the output.\n","\n","The computation performed by the network in transforming the input pattern of activity to the output pattern depends on the set of connection strengths; these weights are usually regarded as encoding the system's knowledge.  In this sense, the connection strengths play the role of the program in a conventional computer. Much of the allure of the connectionist approach is that many connectionist networks program themselves, that is, they have autonomous procedures for tuning their weights to eventually perform some specific computation. Such learning procedures often depend on training in which the network is presented with sample input/output pairs from the function it is supposed to compute. In learning networks with hidden units, the network itself \"decides\" what computations the hidden units will perform; because these units represent neither inputs nor outputs, they are never \"told\" what their values should be, even during training. . . .14One point must be added to Smolensky's portrait. In many connectionist models the hidden units and the output units are assigned a numerical \"bias\" which is added into the calculation determining the unit's activation level. The learning procedures for such networks typically set both the connection strengths and the biases. Thus in these networks the system's knowledge is usually regarded as encoded in both the connection strengths and the biases.\n","\n","So much for a general overview. Let us now try to explain the three features that characterize those connectionist models we take to be incompatible with propositional modularity.\\\\\n","(i) In many non-connectionist cognitive models, like the one illustrated at the end of Section 3, it is an easy matter to locate a functionally distinct part of the model encoding each proposition or state of affairs represented in the system. Indeed, according to Fodor and Pylyshyn, \"conventional [computational] architecture requires that there be distinct symbolic expressions for each state of affairs that it can represent.\"  In some connectionist models an analogous sort of functional localization is possible, not only for the input and output units but for the hidden units as well. Thus, for example, in certain connectionist models, various individual units or small clusters of units are themselves intended to represent specific properties or features of the environment. When the connection strength from one such unit to another is strongly positive, this might be construed as the system's representation of the proposition that if the first feature is present, so too is the second. However, in many connectionist networks it is not possible to localize propositional representation beyond the input layer. That is, there are no particular features or states of the system which lend themselves to a straightforward semantic evaluation. This can sometimes be a real inconvenience to the connectionist model builder when the system as a whole fails to achieve its goal because it has not represented the world the way it should. When this happens, as Smolensky notes, [I]t is not necessarily possible to localize a failure of veridical representation. Any particular state is part of a large causal system of states, and failures of the system to meet goal conditions cannot in general be localized in any particular state or state component.\"16\n","\n","It is connectionist networks of this sort, in which it is not possible to isolate the representation of particular propositions or states of affairs within the nodes, connection strengths and biases, that we have in mind when we talk about the encoding of information in the biases, weights and hidden nodes being widely distributed rather than localist.\\\\\n","(ii) As we've just noted, there are some connectionist models in which some or all of the units are intended to represent specific properties or features of thesystem's environment. These units may be viewed as the model's symbols for the properties or features in question. However, in models where the weights and biases have been tuned by learning algorithms it is often not the case that any single unit or any small collection of units will end up representing a specific feature of the environment in any straightforward way. As we shall see in the next section, it is often plausible to view such networks as collectively or holistically encoding a set of propositions, although none of the hidden units, weights or biases are comfortably viewed as symbols. When this is the case we will call the strategy of representation invoked in the model subsymbolic. Typically (perhaps always?) networks exploiting subsymbolic strategies of representation will encode information in a widely distributed way.\\\\\n","(iii) The third item on our list is not a feature of connectionist models themselves, but rather a point about how the models are to be interpreted. In making this point we must presuppose a notion of theoretical or explanatory level which, despite much discussion in the recent literature, is far from being a paradigm of clarity.  Perhaps the clearest way to introduce the notion of explanatory level is against the background of the familiar functionalist thesis that psycholgoical theories are analogous to programs which can be implemented on a variety of very different sorts of computers.  If one accepts this analogy, then it makes sense to ask whether a particular connectionist model is intended as a model at the psycholgoical level or at the level of underlying neural implementation. Because of their obvious, though in many ways very partial, similarity to real neural architectures, it is tempting to view connectionist models as models of the implementation of psychological processes. And some connectionist model builders endorse this view quite explicitly. So viewed, however, connectionist models are not psychological or cognitive models at all, any more than a story of how cognitive processes are implemented at the quantum mechanical level is a psycholgoical story. A very different view that connectionist model builders can and often do take is that their models are at the psychological level, not at the level of implementation. So construed, the models are in competition with other psychological models of the same phenomena. Thus a connectionist model of word recognition would be an alternative to-and not simply a possible implementation of-a non-connectionist model of word recognition; a connectionist theory of memory would be a competitor to a semantic network theory, and so on. Connectionists who hold this view of their theories often illustrate the point by drawing analogies with other sciences. Smolensky, for example, suggests that connectionist models stand to traditional cognitive models (like semantic networks) in much the same way that quantum mechanics stands to classical me-chanics. In each case the newer theory is deeper, more general and more accurate over a broader range of phenomena. But in each case the new theory and the old are competing at the same explanatory level. If one is right, the other must be wrong.\n","\n","In light of our concerns in this paper, there is one respect in which the analogy between connectionist models and quantum mechanics may be thought to beg an important question. For while quantum mechanics is conceded to be a better theory than classical mechanics, a plausible case could be made that the shift from classical to quantum mechanics was an ontologically conservative theory change. In any event, it is not clear that the change was ontologically radical. If our central thesis in this paper is correct, then the relation between connectionist models and more traditional cognitive models is more like the relation between the caloric theory of heat and the kinetic theory. The caloric and kinetic theories are at the same explanatory level, though the shift from one to the other was pretty clearly ontologically radical. In order to make the case that the caloric analogy is the more appropriate one, it will be useful to describe a concrete, though very simple, connectionist model of memory that meets the three criteria we have been trying to explicate.\n","\n","\\section*{4 Eliminativism Revisited}\n","Recall the argument from superpositional storage. The question was how can it make sense, given that many weights are active in causing an output and each weight participates in the storage of many items of data, to highlight a particular belief as causing an output?\n","\n","Now let us shift our attention a little. Let us focus not on the active weights but upon what they are geared to $d o$. What they are geared to do is to generate a pattern of hidden unit activity which then causes the output.\n","\n","Consider further the kind of output we expect a real-belief encoding system to drive. Such a system must drive a large and subtle set of behaviours. In effect, it will be more like NETtalk (which has a large bank of output units) than the Networks A and B (which have only one unit, with two degrees of freedom). Such a system is very likely to succumb to some form of post hoc analysis.\n","\n","Suppose it does so. In fact, let's suppose that it succumbs to a cluster analysis whose labels involve semantic entities. In such a case, we are able to untangle the superpositional storage by recourse to the higherlevel descriptions of the hidden unit activation states. Thus if, on being given a certain input, the network goes into a hidden unit activation state which falls squarely into a cluster we have found reason to label 'dogs have fur', we would be warranted (regardless of superpositional storage) in saying that it gave a certain output because at that moment it believed that dogs have fur.\n","\n","These are, of course, big ifs: if the network succumbs to such an analysis and if it warrants labels like 'dogs have fur'. But the move is dialectically sound. For RS\\&G purport to argue directly from distributed, sub-symbolic storage and representation to eliminativism. The mere possibility of a cluster analysis turning out as I've suggested shows that there is no direct inference of the kind claimed. For it should be obvious that if we can unpick the superpositional storage as suggested, then the arguments from natural kinds and equipotency are immediately undermined.\n","\n","Thus consider once again the argument from natural kinds. The pivotal fact was the lack of any units-and-weights kind uniting nets $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}$ and so on. But we can now see that RS\\&G being unduly reductionist about well-motivated kinds. The fact that networks which are quite various at the units-and-connectivity level of description are treated as instances of a psychological kind need occasion no more surprise than the fact that an Amstrad and an Atari may, subject to running the right software, be treated as instances of a computational kind (e.g. as instantiations of a certain word-processing package). All that the varietyof-networks point establishes is that Connectionist psychology may need at times to avail itself of higher-level descriptions than units, connections and weights descriptions. But the example of cluster analysis shows that it is possible to reveal that a whole set of networks fall into an equivalence class defined by the way their various assignments of weights divide the spacing of possible input patterns into significant sub-spaces. Thus it would be perfectly legitimate (given the common clustering profile) to assign all the instances of NETtalk to a psychological kind even though they look very different at the units-andweights level. Such a grouping might help us explain some shared error patterns and the relative difficulty of processing various inputs. Of course, as Churchland (1989) points out, for some explanatory purposes (e.g. predicting how future learning will affect weight distributions) the differences will make a difference. My point is only that there may be some legitimate psychological-explanatory interests which call for the higher-level grouping provided by the cluster analysis.\n","\n","The basic philosophical point here is a very familiar one. Good explanations may demand the grouping together of systems which, at a low enough level of physical description, form a 'chaotically disjunctive set'. Thus economics may group an earth community and an antimatter-earth community together as instantiating Keynesian economic systems. And we are probably all familiar with Putnam's peg-and-hole example (see Putnam, 1981) in which the explanation of variously constituted square pegs passing through square holes is to be given in terms of common higher-level properties of rigidity, solidity and so on.\n","\n","Finally, there was the matter of equipotency. The worry, recall, was that it seemed to make no sense to suppose that an agent could have two beliefs, each capable of causing a given action, and yet only one of which did, as a matter of fact, cause the action. But now consider the case of Lesley's two beliefs (one about Coopers, one about the open fire). It is a simple matter to establish that the system must in general be capable of action which is appropriate to each belief individually (e.g. it must be capable of some range of actions which are beer-related and not fire-related). For otherwise the description of the network as knowing the two facts would be unwarranted. But this requires that the system be capable of a set of hidden unit activation patterns which are associated with the beer-belief, and a different (perhaps partially overlapping) set capable of powering different outputs, and associated with the firebelief. So we can say that one belief rather than the other was active just in case, for example, we found an instance of activation in the beercluster and not in the fire-cluster (this kind of response, in RS\\&G, is accredited to Adrian Cussins and Gary Cottrell).\n","\n","RS\\&G respond by saying that it is a mistake to identify the belief state with the transient activation state. Thus they write that:\\\\\n","in common-sense psychology beliefs and propositional memories are typically of substantial duration . . . An activation pattern, however, is not an enduring state of a network . . [for example] there is an enormous number of . . . beliefs that you've had for years. But it makes no sense to suppose that a network could have many activation patterns continuously over a long period of time. At any given time a network exhibits at most one pattern of activation. (Chapter 8, p. 331)\n","\n","Suppose we accept this. The next obvious move is to suggest that we might identify the belief not with the transient activation pattern but with the long-standing disposition to produce that activation pattern in a given circumstance. This move in the dialectic is credited to Ned Block and Frank Jackson. The trouble is, of course, that it is not obvious that the various dispositions said to correspond to various beliefs are sufficiently extricable from one another, qua subvening states of the system, to count as the 'discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requiresâ€™ (Chapter 8, p. 333).\n","\n","But this just muddies the waters unnecessarily. Beliefs need to be long-standing states, yes. And a belief-in-action needs to be capable of having a functionally discrete realization, yes. But the folk are nowhere committed to the view that the belief-in-action and the long-standing stored state must be physically identical. The long-standing stored state may be the disposition, given inputs $A-F$ to propagate activation so as to yield a pattern of hidden unit activation $P$ which falls within a cluster appropriate to 'believing that the pub has Coopers'. And the discrete causal potency of that belief may be the power of that class of hidden unit activation states to cause a distinctive kind of output. So we have long-standing states and a degree of causal discretion. But what has causal discretion is not the long-standing state but the state of activation to which it gives rise.\n","\n","Someone might, I suppose, worry that being in a certain cluster cannot, properly speaking, be a cause. Thus, they might insist that what actually does the causing must always be a particular hidden unit activation pattern and hence that, if we have to appeal to clusterings of such patterns to find analogues for semantic items, the semantic items cannot figure in the real causal story.\n","\n","But this is surely a dangerous move. For it places the philosophical feet on a slippery slope to physics worship (and fundamental physics worship at that). And this is radically revisionary. Chemistry, for example, is generally regarded as a respectable special science, and yet it is concerned to group different physical structures as instances of chemical types and to define causal laws which apply to those types. So unless the sceptic is willing is give up the causal efficacy of chemical properties too, he or she would be unwise to object to the very idea of higher-level constructs figuring in genuine causal claims.\n","\n","In general, then, it seems as if the invocation of higher-level descriptions of hidden unit activity patterns may provide for the kind of causal discretion RS\\&G require. There is, however, a class of cases (invoked in a dialectic towards the end of Chapter 8 ), which may still look problematic. These are the cases (call them lemma-belief cases) where a particular belief is said to cause a particular belief, which in turn causes an action.\n","\n","The trouble here is simple. Our account provides a single locus of discrete, causally-active belief states, viz. the locus consisting of a hidden unit activation pattern. But in some cases we seem to want two (or more) such loci. Thus consider the case of Clouseau who has the long-standing beliefs (dispositionally analysed) $p \\rightarrow q, q \\rightarrow s$ $p \\rightarrow r, r \\rightarrow s$ and learns that $p$. Suppose we want to say of Clouseau that:\\\\\n","(a) he infers $s$ using only the $q$-information; and\\\\\n","(b) his belief that $s$ then causes him to perform an action $A$.\n","\n","It now looks as if the hidden unit states resulting from input $p$ need to fall simultaneously into the $q$-cluster and the $s$-cluster variety. But the network cannot be in both states at once.\n","\n","The answer here is to introduce a notion of recurrency. A recurrent network is one which can cycle an output state back as an input state and continue processing. Now any good model of the belief system must allow that belief can play two roles. One is to mediate between perception and action. The other is to mediate between belief and belief. This means that the output states and input states must be capable of taking belief states as data too. In which case the answer to the single locus worry is to invoke a single locus used twice in a serial process. Thus in the Clouseau case we would have input $p$ yielding hidden unit activation falling into the $q$-cluster sector, which causes output meaning that $q$. This is then cycled back as input which yields activation falling into the $s$-sector and causing action $A$.\n","\n","In sum, it seems that, contrary to the eliminativists' conditional argument, distributed sub-symbolic models can allow for individual beliefs to be discretely active  in causing behaviour and other beliefs. They can do so if we adopt the following analysis:\\\\\n","1 Long-standing states of believing that $p=$ the networks disposition, given apt input, to produce hidden unit activation states falling into a cluster  which warrants the label $p$.\\\\\n","2 Active states of believing that $p=$ patterns of hidden unit activation falling into the $p$-cluster.\\\\\n","3 Active lemma-belief states $=$ as (2) but realized in a recurrent network.\n","\n","\\section*{4 C-beliefs and Propositional Modularity}\n","We now move on to the crucial question: do the notions of C - and L belief possess any of the three properties of propositional modularity which RS\\&G claim make Classical belief a target for elimination by the PTC form of connectionism? Let's consider these three properties in turn.\n","\n","Semantic interpretability\n","Clearly both C-beliefs and L-beliefs involve semantic interpretation. The fundamental principle driving the analysis we have developed is the semantic level principle, which asserts that semantically interpretable aspects of connectionist netporks lie at the higher level of activation and weight vectors, and not at the lower level of individual units and connections. To make claims about semantic properties of connectionist networks based on staring at individual units and connections is to make a fundamental category error. In the absence of something like weight and learning analysis, carried out at the vector level - in the absence of some understanding of what is going on at this higher level of description - no sound claims about any semantic properties are possible. But concepts such as C- and L-beliefs, and others that reside at the higher level, do exist, and do make it possible to explain the behaviors of connectionist networks in semantically interpretable terms.\n","\n","Functional discreteness\n","RS\\&G's discussion of functional discreteness centers on the relation between their Network A - successfully trained on a set of 16 propositions - and Network B - successfully trained on this same set with an additional 17th proposition added. We can apply the notions of C- and L-beliefs to understand the relation between Net A and Net B, which are analogous to RS\\&G's except the network architecture is that of RSGnet $_{0}$ rather than that of RSGnet. The C-beliefs of Net B include the 17 it was trained on, 16 of which are also held by Net $A$. That means the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}_{B}$ of Net B must lie in a solution space $S_{B}$ that is smaller than the solution space $S_{A}$ containing $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}}: S_{A}$ is defined as the intersection of 16 half-spaces, while $S_{B}$ is the intersection of these 16 with an additional 17th half-space. Despite the fact that the C-beliefs are not physically localizable to different spatial sub-regions of the networks, there is none the less a more abstract but perfectly welldefined sense in which the 17 beliefs are functionally discrete: the projectable predicates in terms of which we describe the knowledgeencoding vectors $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}} / \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are just the $16 / 17 \\mathrm{C}$-beliefs. The sensible thing to say about these nets, as far as actual Connectionist theory is concerned, is precisely that there is a particular additional C-belief in the second net as compared to the first. Furthermore, if some process were to disturb the weight vector $w_{\\mathrm{B}}$, so that it moved out of the solution space $S_{B}$ while still remaining within the larger solution space $S_{A}$, it would make perfectly good sense to say that the second net had 'lost' or 'forgotten' the 17 th belief, while retaining the other 16 . The sensibleness of talking of one belief coming or going independently of others is the focus of RS\\&G's characterization of functional discreteness (chapter 8, p. 316).\n","\n","Functional discreteness can be seen via L-beliefs as well, although greater caution is required. For, assuming Nets A and B to have been trained according to (7), their weight vectors $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathbf{A}}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are given by (6) as:\n","\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","& \\mathrm{A} \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\mathbf{p}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\mathbf{q}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\mathbf{r}^{*}+\\ldots  \\tag{11} & \\mathrm{B} \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathbf{B}}=\\operatorname{tr}(p) \\mathbf{p}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(q) \\mathbf{q}^{*}+\\operatorname{tr}(r) \\mathbf{r}^{*}+\\ldots+\\operatorname{tr}(z) \\mathbf{z}^{*}\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","\n","where $z$ is the extra (17th) proposition on which Net $B$ is trained. It is important to remember that the * operation depends on the training set, so that in fact the vector denoted $\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ in (11A) and that denoted $\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ in (11B) are, in general, somewhat different vectors.  Thus we can analyze $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ as containing 16 and 17 L-beliefs, respectively. In this case, the L-belief that $p$ has truth value $\\operatorname{tr}(p)$ is in general somewhat different in the two networks.\n","\n","Thus our excursion into basic Connectionist theory shows the falsehood of RS\\&G's crucial claim, part of which was cited in section 1 as the primary impetus behind this reply:\n","\n","The contrast between Network A and Network B enables us to make our point about the incompatibility between common-sense psychology and these sorts of connectionist models in a rather different way. We noted in section 3 that common-sense psychology treats predicates expressing the semantic properties of propositional attitudes as projectable. Thus 'believes that dogs have fur' or 'remembers that dogs have fur' will be projectable predicates in common-sense psychology. Now both Network A and Network B might serve as models for a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur; both networks store or represent the information that dogs have fur. Nor are these the only two. If we were to train up a network on the 17 propositions in table 8.1 plus a few (or minus a few) we would get yet another system which is as different from Networks A and B as these two are from each other. The moral here is that though there are indefinitely many connectionist networks that represent the information that dogs have fur just as well as Network A does, these networks have no projectable features in common that are describable in the language of Connectionist theory. From the point of view of the connectionist model builder, the class of networks that might model a cognitive agent who believes that dogs have fur is not a genuine kind at all, but simply a chaotically disjunctive set. Common-sense psychology treats the class of people who believe that dogs have fur as a psychologically natural kind; Connectionist psychology does not. (chapter 8, pp. 328-9)\n","\n","Causal role\n","While C- and L-beliefs possess the first two properties of propositional modularity, the same is not true of the final property. The modular causal roles of the beliefs of folk psychology are illustrated by RS\\&G as follows: it makes sense to say (a) that a particular instance of an action taken by an agent was caused by a particular belief/desire pair and not another, even though both pairs are held by the agent and both pairs rationally entail taking the given action; (b) that a particular instance in which an agent infers a conclusion was caused by one set of beliefs and not another, even though both sets are held by the agent and both sets logically entail the given conclusion (pp. 317-18). Focusing on the most relevant case (b), we must conclude that there is no corresponding sense for $\\mathrm{RSGnet}_{0}$ that some set of relevant C-beliefs are causally implicated in an inference on a particular occasion, while another set of relevant Cbeliefs are not causally implicated on that occasion, but might be on another.\n","\n","That this property fails for RSGnet $_{0}$ is probably clearest from learning analysis. As explained in (10) above, when a proposition $x$ is presented to be judged, the net computes its judgment by superimposing its response to all the training patterns $\\pi$, each such response weighted by the similarity of $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\pi^{*}$. When this similarity is $0-$ when $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\pi^{*}=0$, i.e. when the L-belief $\\operatorname{tr}(\\pi) \\pi^{*}$ concerning $\\pi$ produces no judgment of $\\mathbf{x}$ as true or false - then the effect of the training pattern $\\pi$ on the judgment of $x$ is nil. (Thus, for example, if the truth value of $\\pi$, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\pi)$, were reversed prior to training the net, this would have no effect on the judgment of $x$.) In such a case it could be reasonably said that this L-belief is not relevant to $x$ and has no 'causal role' in the judgment of $x$. On the other hand, if the similarity of $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\pi^{*}$ is non-zero, then the L-belief about the truth value of $\\pi$ is relevant, and it plays a causal role in the net's judgment of $x$. There is no meaningful sense in which a relevant belief might play a causal role in judging $x$ on one occasion, but not another; all relevant beliefs always have the same causal role.\n","\n","\\subsection*{2.2 Superpositional storage and discrete causal efficacy}\n","The second argument in RS\\&G that Clark considers is the one he calls the argument from 'superpositional storage'. The essential claim in that argument is that, in networks like A and B , in which information 'is stored holistically and distributed throughout the network ... [It] makes no sense to ask whether or not the representation of a particular proposition plays a causal role in the network's computation' (Chapter 8, p. 327). By contrast, common-sense psychology assumes that it typically does makes sense to ask whether a given belief played a role in a certain cognitive episode, or whether it was causally inactive in that episode. Moreover, common sense recognizes that in some cases '[a]n agent may have two long-standing beliefs which are both equipotent (both apt to cause the same piece of behaviour on a given occasion) AND YET the agent may as a matter of fact act on the basis of only one of the two beliefs' (Clark, chapter 9, p. 345). Clark labels this latter thesis the 'Equipotency claim'.\n","\n","In responding to RS\\&G's argument, Clark's first move is to propose that we identify a belief with a certain pattern of hidden unit activation. If we do this, there will be no problem in saying whether or not a given belief plays a causal role in a particular computation that the network performs. But, as Clark goes on to note, this proposal was anticipated in RS\\&G, and criticized on the grounds that having a certain belief is typically a long-standing feature of a system, while being in a certain activation state is not an enduring state of the network.\n","\n","Very well, Clark continues, '[s]uppose we accept this. The next obvious move is to suggest that we might identify the belief not with the transient activation pattern but with the long-standing disposition to produce that activation pattern in a given circumstance' (p. 350.) But, as Clark reports, this move, too was anticipated and criticized RS\\&G.\n","\n","The trouble is, of course, that it is not obvious that the various dispositions said to correspond to various beliefs are sufficiently extricable from one another, qua subvening states of the system, to count as the 'discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires'. (p. 350) 'But', Clark continues, this just muddies the waters unnecessarily. Beliefs need to be longstanding states, yes. And a belief-in-action needs to be capable of having a functionally discrete realization, yes. But the folk are nowhere committed to the view that the belief-in-action and the long-standing belief must be physically identical. The long-standing stored state may be the disposition [to produce an appropriate pattern of hidden unit activation]. And the discrete causal potency of that belief may be the power of that class of hidden unit activation states to cause a distinctive kind of output. (p. 350)\n","\n","On our view, there are two rather different problems with this reply. First, the interpretation of the propositional modularity assumption that is implicit in the reply is much too weak; indeed, it is so weak that it renders the assumption completely trivial. For, on the interpretation of propositional modularity that Clark's argument requires, no deterministic system that stores propositional information could fail to satisfy propositional modularity. If this is right, there is nothing at all we could learn about the workings of such a system that would show that it violates propositional modularity. Secondly, as Clark himself concedes, his suggestion does not really address the problem posed by equipotency unless it is supplemented with an assumption about recurrency. But that assumption leads to models of cognitive activity that are both bizarre and unworkable. We'll elaborate on each of these problems in turn.\n","\n","Imagine that you are given a black box which behaves just the way that RS\\&G's Network A does. Given any of the 16 coded sentences in table $8-1$ of RS\\&G, it answers yes or no, and the answers are the same as the ones Network A would produce. Suppose further that we know the black box is a deterministic device: it responds the same way each time it is given an input of a particular type. Beyond this, we will assume we know nothing at all about how the device works.\n","\n","Let's now ask whether the device respects the principle of propositional modularity. On Clark's interpretation of the principle, it would seem that the answer must be yes. For, every time the black box is given a particular input, it produces the same output. And there must be some pattern of internal states - simple or complex - which the system goes through in getting from the input to the output. So, following Clark, we can identify the 'belief-in-action' with this pattern of internal states, whatever it may be. Of course, this pattern is a transient state, not an enduring state of the system. So if we are looking for long-standing beliefs, it is not a good candidate. But this needn't worry us. For the system must have a long-standing disposition to produce the 'belief-inaction' pattern, and we can identify that disposition with the longstanding belief. Of course, the 'belief-in-action' is a very different state of the system from the long-standing belief. But, according to Clark, that's just fine. There is no need for the two to be identical. So it looks like our black box satisfies propositional modularity, as Clark would interpret it. And, since we know nothing about the box except that it is a deterministic device that responds appropriately, it looks like any deterministic device that can respond appropriately to various coded sentences must represent them in a propositionally modular fashion. On Clark's reading of propositional modularity, anything that behaves like a believer really is one.\n","\n","Now we can imagine an opponent who would be quite happy with this result. The opponent we are imagining contends that common-sense psychology makes no really substantive claims about the mechanisms underlying behavior. There are passages in Dennett's work which appear to endorse such a view (see, for example, Dennett, 1987), and Jackson and Pettit (1990) also seem to flirt with this sort of neobehaviorist account of belief. But this would be an odd position for Clark to endorse. A central theme in Clark's work is that if the scientific account of the mechanisms underlying behavior turn out to conflict with the common-sense account, 'then we've got trouble' (p.352) since the eliminativist will have won the day. Since Clark is prepared to take this eliminativist threat seriously, he can't adopt the toothless interpretation of propositional modularity that his reply to RS\\&G requires. For, on that interpretation, any deterministic system that behaves like a believer automatically satisfies propositional modularity, and there is no possibility that a scientific account of the mechanisms underlying that behavior will conflict with propositional modularity.\n","\n","Let's turn, now, to Clark's discussion of the equipotency problem. In the case sketched by RS\\&G, Clouseau has two long-standing beliefs each of which might contribute to his inference that the butler is lying. On Clark's proposal, both of these long-standing beliefs are dispositions of the belief-storage system. So how are we to tell which of them contributed to the inference? Clark's answer appeals to the notion of recurrence. In order to play a role in an inference, the dispositional state must first produce a hidden activation pattern, which causes an output; that output is 'then cycled back as input' to the storage system, which then yields the conclusion about the butler as a second output.\n","\n","Perhaps the first thing to say about this proposal is that it hardly seems in the spirit of connectionism, since it ignores what ardent connectionists see as one of the most important virtues of their models: the capacity to simultaneously make use of a large number of facts or constraints. On Clark's account of inference, by contrast, each intermediate step in an inference must be individually activated and then cycled back as a premise in a new computational cycle.\n","\n","But this is the least of the problems with Clark's proposal. A much more serious problem is that the idea just won't work when the logical forms of the conditionals involved in the inference are a bit more complex. Suppose, for example, that Clouseau has long-standing beliefs of the form:\n","\n","If $p^{*}$ then $p$\\\\\n","If $q^{*}$ then $q$ and\\\\\n","If $p \\& q$ then $s$\\\\\n","Now suppose he is informed that $p^{*}$. After a brief delay during which he may think about other matters, he is informed that $q^{*}$. How is he supposed to get to s? Well, as Clark tells the story, when he learns that $p^{*}$, he outputs $p$. At this point he might recycle $p$ into the system. But it wouldn't produce $s$. Now $q^{*}$ comes along. The system outputs $q$. Feeding this back as input won't yield $s$ either. As far as we can see, there is no way for the system that Clark sketches to get from $p^{*}$ and $q^{*}$ to $s$. So, far from having the resources to handle cases of equipotence, the sort of system Clark proposes does not even have the capacity to handle simple inferences.\n","\n"]}],"source":["most_relevant_indices = [196, 83, 91, 94]\n","for i in most_relevant_indices:\n","    print(list_existing_argument_texts[i])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":33,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739813114291,"user":{"displayName":"Sam","userId":"18172871330063317003"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"Gh0zg9GQ6gRj","outputId":"35816536-354c-4bbf-aa2a-4cf6663162b7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["True\n"]}],"source":["check_inclusion = all(elem in relevant_text_indices for elem in most_relevant_indices)\n","print(check_inclusion)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":67,"referenced_widgets":["a62cee53c6584f67bd95dd27036fc180","f3823457260a40eea01c8d85d26c7871","19966a47ee1a4d7b9969b3d46b73c1b3","e381c07766274b3b81f3e163db48ce88","dd0d277f41914c0eba44e75bf7889413","13d34dedaf5d40888938918e50d276f8","fd8934b7252e4ab9965b4d95e08211c1","7f7506867f80426895131b41e0146486","921fa0f6a45e4d05a1be061bb846084a","3794049bf7aa4aadaef9daeb53d549ec","a29beb1b20774d5d98b079066854ce8f"]},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739813114291,"user":{"displayName":"Sam","userId":"18172871330063317003"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"hXcjP8Oi3SFf","outputId":"11e315f4-36d3-4407-8098-9661ee7a8aa7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["(…)_process_relevant_outline_seed9_o1.jsonl:   0%|          | 0.00/483k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"a62cee53c6584f67bd95dd27036fc180"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["51\n"]}],"source":["gpt_model_title = \"o1\"\n","n=1\n","seed=seeds[0]\n","repo_name = \"Chickward/processes\"\n","filename = f\"{len(relevant_text_indices)}_process_relevant_outline_seed{seed}_{gpt_model_title}\"\n","if gpt_gen:\n","    process_relevant_outline = []\n","    response_relevant_outline = []\n","    for i in relevant_text_indices:\n","        generate_gpt_responses(1, outline_synthesis_instruction,\n","                              outline_synthesis_input.format(list_existing_argument_texts[i]),\n","                              process_relevant_outline, response_relevant_outline)\n","    save_and_upload(process_relevant_outline)\n","process_relevant_outline, response_relevant_outline = download_and_process_file(False)\n","gpt_relevant_existing_outlines = response_relevant_outline\n","print(len(gpt_relevant_existing_outlines))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yx1DgTn4BPZS"},"source":["## Embedding"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wWfDzQ49QAWO"},"outputs":[],"source":["def embed_text(texts) -> list[list[float]]:\n","\n","    # The dimensionality of the output embeddings.\n","    dimensionality = 768\n","    # The task type for embedding.

The main claim advanced here is that functionally discrete beliefs, which exert a genuine causal role in cognition, are indeed compatible with connectionist models. In support of this view, it is argued that stable activation patterns within specialized subnetworks can serve as the neural substrate for discrete beliefs; that these patterns are capable of guiding cognitive processes toward particular outcomes, thereby functioning causally; and that structural constraints alongside systematic learning mechanisms preserve interpretability, allowing such patterns to exhibit semantic distinctness. Taken together, these factors show how connectionist architectures can give rise to belief-like states that align with commonly invoked notions of belief in everyday psychological and philosophical discourse.\n","\n","First, connectionist systems are often characterized by overlapping representations that consist of weighted links spread across multiple units, in contrast to traditional symbolic models that designate a particular symbol or location for every discrete concept. A natural worry is that, because representations in connectionist networks are distributed, they cannot maintain the kind of stable and distinguishable structures typically required for a belief. However, specialized subnetwork interactions can give rise to recurring activation patterns that reliably hold together in response to repeating inputs or contextual conditions. For example, if a connectionist system is trained to discriminate between different linguistic or perceptual categories, certain clusters of neurons—or smaller subnetworks—become selectively responsive to specific inputs. Crucially, these recurring patterns do not vanish or dissolve into unstructured “blends.” Rather, the network asymptotically converges toward similar activation profiles each time it encounters a relevant cue, rendering the underlying states sufficiently stable for them to be identified in functionally discrete ways. Like a stable cognitive schema, such patterns persist over time and can be reactivated when needed, thereby plausibly reflecting the content of what we ordinarily call a “belief.”\n","\n","Second, these stable patterns do not merely exist as inert states; instead, they shape and direct downstream processing in ways analogous to the causal role attributed to beliefs in standard folk-psychological discourse. When a trained network encounters a familiar stimulus, it will automatically transition toward the corresponding activation pattern. That pattern, in turn, influences subsequent computations, such as predicting linguistic outputs, categorizing objects, retrieving stored associations, or planning motor actions. By steering the system’s processing toward particular inferences or responses, the activation pattern fulfills a function akin to how everyday psychology ascribes discrete causal powers to beliefs. For instance, if the network’s “belief” is that an object is a cup, the coalition of units encoding this pattern will trigger, among other things, inferences about shape and possible manipulations, much as a human’s belief about a cup might cause them to reach for it when thirsty. Thus, because the stable activation patterns can be shown to direct cognition systematically, one can ascribe a form of causal efficacy structurally tantamount to the everyday notion of beliefs having discrete influences on thought and action.\n","\n","A third consideration concerns interpretability and semantic distinctness. It is often argued that, while connectionist systems might generate certain stable patterns, those patterns allegedly remain inscrutable “blobs” of distributed activation. On this view, they would not count as functionally discrete or semantically assessable in the manner that beliefs are typically understood. Yet even if the representation is distributed, structural constraints on how networks are built and systematically trained help maintain coherence and interpretability. In practical demonstration, researchers can often track which subnetwork pathways become active and link them to particular conceptual distinctions. Indeed, standard error backpropagation and other learning algorithms favor networks that optimize performance within structurally defined limits, leading to consistent, re-identifiable patterns corresponding to specific input–output mappings. These patterns can thus be mapped to semantic content, such as “representing cups” or “knowing how to balance an equation,” ensuring that individual patterns retain meaningful differences from one another. While these representations lack the one-to-one correspondence typical of a purely symbolic scheme, they remain functionally separable and semantically loaded in a way that supports fine-grained discriminations—breadth that is characteristic of a robust notion of belief. \n","\n","Furthermore, this arrangement coheres with an idea of propositional modularity in the sense that beliefs, even if distributed, can be internally organized so that distinct subnetworks underlie specific concept clusters. Propositional modularity does not necessarily demand a physically localized structure for every discrete proposition; rather, it requires that a certain set of propositional contents be available in a streamlined manner for cognitive use. Connectionist networks can indeed achieve this condition so long as the learned architecture supports stable states that encode propositional content in a way that can be invoked selectively. The role of structural constraints here is to guarantee that each stable pattern—each “discrete belief”—has the potential to be reactivated when relevant contexts arise, thus preserving the functional boundaries among different clusters of knowledge or belief-like entities.\n","\n","In summary, the concern that connectionist architectures cannot realize functionally discrete beliefs is mitigated by appreciating the stability and recurrence properties of specialized subnetworks and their activation patterns. Such patterns can maintain sufficient coherence and continuity to give rise to higher-level cognitive states that we call “beliefs.” Furthermore, these patterns exert robust causal influences on cognition, steering inferences and responses in a systematic manner, much like beliefs do in common-sense psychology. Finally, the processes of structural constraint and systematic learning ensure that these patterns remain semantically discernible from one another, retaining the distinctions necessary for interpretability and content attribution. As a result, connectionist models need not be at odds with the notion of genuine beliefs; they can implement states that meet the major criteria of functionally discrete, causally significant beliefs without sacrificing the rich, distributed nature that many regard as the core virtue of connectionist approaches.\n","(7206 characters)\n"]}],"source":["seed = seeds[6]\n","gpt_model_title = \"o1\"\n","\n","if gpt_gen:\n","  gpt_process_argument_texts = []\n","  gpt_response_argument_texts = []\n","  generate_gpt_responses(1, argue_generation_instruction,\n","                          o1_cogentoriginal_best, gpt_process_argument_texts, gpt_response_argument_texts)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["gpt-4o:\n","\n","In the ongoing discourse on the compatibility of connectionist models with traditional cognitive constructs, the notion that functionally discrete beliefs can play a causal role within such models is a compelling proposition. This claim challenges the conventional dichotomy between symbolic and connectionist paradigms by suggesting that connectionist systems, often characterized by their distributed and non-symbolic nature, can indeed accommodate functionally discrete beliefs. This section will explore how specialized subnetwork interactions, distinct activation patterns, and structural constraints within connectionist architectures can support this compatibility.\n","\n","**Specialized Subnetwork Interactions and Stability of Activation Patterns**\n","\n","Connectionist models, particularly those employing artificial neural networks, are often critiqued for their lack of clear, discrete representations akin to symbolic models. However, through specialized subnetwork interactions, these models can form distinct and recurring activation patterns that exhibit a degree of stability necessary for functional discreteness. In a connectionist system, subnetworks can be thought of as clusters of neurons that are more densely interconnected with each other than with the rest of the network. These subnetworks can develop specialized roles through training, akin to functional modules in the brain, which are responsible for processing specific types of information.\n","\n","The stability of these activation patterns is crucial for them to be considered functionally discrete. Stability here refers to the ability of a pattern to recur consistently in response to similar inputs, thereby maintaining its identity over time. This is achieved through the dynamic interactions within and between subnetworks, which can reinforce certain patterns while suppressing others. For instance, Hebbian learning principles, which strengthen connections between co-activated neurons, can lead to the emergence of stable patterns that are repeatedly activated in response to specific stimuli. These patterns can be seen as analogous to beliefs, as they represent consistent responses to particular inputs, reflecting a form of cognitive commitment.\n","\n","**Causal Influence of Activation Patterns**\n","\n","The second reason supporting the compatibility of functionally discrete beliefs with connectionist models is the ability of these activation patterns to direct processing toward particular outcomes, thereby exerting unique causal influences. In traditional cognitive psychology, beliefs are often understood as mental states that causally influence behavior and thought processes. Similarly, in a connectionist framework, distinct activation patterns can guide the network's processing in specific directions, influencing the system's outputs in a manner akin to the causal role of beliefs.\n","\n","For example, consider a connectionist model trained to recognize objects. Within this model, certain activation patterns may become associated with the recognition of specific objects, such as a cat or a dog. When the model encounters an image of a cat, the activation pattern corresponding to \"cat\" is triggered, directing the network's processing toward generating the appropriate output, such as labeling the image as a cat. This process mirrors the causal role of beliefs in human cognition, where the belief that \"this is a cat\" leads to specific cognitive and behavioral responses.\n","\n","**Structural Constraints and Systematic Learning**\n","\n","The third reason emphasizes the role of structural constraints and systematic learning in preserving meaningful differences among activation patterns, allowing them to remain interpretable and semantically distinct. Connectionist models are often criticized for their distributed nature, which can obscure the interpretability of individual units or patterns. However, through carefully designed architectures and learning algorithms, connectionist systems can maintain the semantic distinctiveness of activation patterns.\n","\n","Structural constraints, such as the architecture of the network and the nature of the connections between neurons, play a crucial role in shaping the learning process. These constraints can guide the network to develop distinct patterns that correspond to different semantic categories or beliefs. For instance, hierarchical architectures, where higher layers capture more abstract features, can facilitate the emergence of semantically distinct patterns that align with propositional modularity.\n","\n","Systematic learning, often implemented through backpropagation and gradient descent, further ensures that these patterns are refined and maintained throughout the training process. By minimizing error in the network's outputs, learning algorithms help stabilize activation patterns that are functionally significant, reinforcing their role as discrete entities within the system. This process allows connectionist models to implement beliefs that are both functionally discrete and causally significant, bridging the gap between distributed representations and propositional modularity.\n","\n","In conclusion, the compatibility of functionally discrete beliefs with connectionist models is supported by the ability of these systems to form stable, distinct activation patterns through specialized subnetwork interactions, direct processing toward specific outcomes, and preserve semantic distinctiveness through structural constraints and systematic learning. These features demonstrate that connectionist architectures can feasibly implement beliefs that are both functionally discrete and causally significant, challenging the traditional divide between symbolic and connectionist paradigms in cognitive science."],"metadata":{"id":"hBkOQIltOw6R"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["o1:\n","\n","An oft-cited worry regarding connectionist architectures is that they purportedly fail to preserve the functional discreteness and causal efficacy that beliefs exhibit in everyday psychological explanations. Put differently, critics have contended that the diffuse nature of activation patterns in neural networks is incompatible with the apparent neatness of belief ascriptions. Contrary to this objection, however, the possibility remains that connectionist models can indeed host functionally discrete states with the capacity to influence system behavior in a manner akin to beliefs. The key is to focus on how specialized subnetwork interactions form stable patterns that guide cognitive processing, thereby allowing these patterns to play discrete and causally significant roles. When we examine the features of connectionist systems carefully—particularly their capacity for recurrent, stable activation patterns, the unique causal influence of such patterns, and the shaping effects of structural constraints and systematic learning—it becomes plausible that these networks can implement beliefs in a way that upholds their purported modular and propositional character.\n","\n","First, consider the notion that connectionist architectures frequently involve multiple, interlocking subnetworks, each specialized for a particular domain or range of tasks. Through prolonged training and interaction with various inputs, these subnetworks develop stable activation configurations. In practical connectionist models, these configurations may recur across many different contexts, surfacing whenever the network encounters patterns sufficiently similar to those that gave rise to the state in prior processing episodes. Such stability stems, in part, from constraints in the connection weights, as well as from the interactions between multiple layers or modules that reinforce recurring responses. Each time the network returns to that particular stable configuration, one can interpret the system as “settling” into a representation functionally akin to a belief about that input. Thus, far from being merely ephemeral or poorly individuable, training-induced activation patterns can indeed take on recurrent, stable forms. When they do, they manifest in ways that could plausibly be described as a belief state: a particular perspective the system adopts in response to certain cues.\n","\n","Second, once these stable patterns emerge, they drive distinct downstream processes. For instance, the system’s next set of operations or responses will be shaped partly by the way, at a certain level of hidden units, the network has encoded its “understanding” of the relevant input. This understanding is not simply an associative blur. Rather, from one interaction to the next, the network harnesses such patterns to predict, classify, or otherwise process information, thereby guiding a unique chain of inferences or actions. If a connectionist system trained for language comprehension and inference “settles” into a particular stable pattern upon hearing a certain sentence, that pattern may yield specific expectations (e.g., that a further clause in the paragraph should elaborate on a previously mentioned entity). The connectivity rules will dictate subsequent transformations in line with that stable pattern’s distinct perspective. This downstream guidance is precisely the sort of causal efficacy that we normally associate with beliefs in a human agent. In the human case, if one believes that it will rain, one’s entire repertoire of subsequent decisions (e.g., whether to carry an umbrella) is modulated accordingly. Analogously, in the connectionist system, this pattern fosters a unique cascade of influence on further processing pathways, testifying to its causal potency.\n","\n","Third, these patterns do not forfeit interpretability or semantic depth merely because they are distributed across numerous weights. A stable connectionist pattern becomes intelligible in virtue of the constraints that shape and maintain it. At the architectural level, systematically arranged layers can be dedicated (or partly specialized) to capturing particular domains of discrimination, such as visual objects, phonological forms, or conceptual categories. Over time, the system learns to encode subtle distinctions by adjusting weights in response to training signals, thus channeling certain types of signals through specialized subnetworks. The result is that patterns corresponding to, say, “sphere” versus “cube,” or “dog” versus “wolf,” remain systematically distinct, even though they are distributed. While each of these patterns involves a web of activations that may overlap in many units, the overall profile is reliably separable in input-output mapping. This reliable separability forms the functional discreteness akin to having distinct beliefs about, for example, “a ball’s shape” versus “a dog’s category.” Because each pattern is anchored by the structural and learning constraints, the resulting differentiability is robust across multiple contexts. Just as a propositional module might treat the statement “Dogs are mammals” differently from “Dogs can speak,” so too a sufficiently trained network would settle into different patterns when confronted with each statement. Hence, the system’s capacity to differentiate between the patterns both preserves interpretability—because we can, in principle, analyze why the network settled on one pattern rather than another—and maintains a semantic dimension, since these stable patterns can be viewed as carrying content about the world.\n","\n","In light of these considerations, there is a strong case that connectionist networks can realize belief-like states that are functionally discrete and causally significant. Indeed, the very objection that the network’s representations are not “local” or “symbol-like” enough loses some force when we see how emergent subnetworks can exhibit stable patterns. These patterns, though distributed at the lower level among many weighted connections, (1) reoccur with sufficient reliability to be structurally identified, (2) exert unique influences on processing much as beliefs do, and (3) remain systematically distinguishable and semantically loaded due to the constraining forces of learning and architectural design. Thus, even without a one-to-one mapping between units and concept tokens, connectionist models can adequately implement the relevant psychological machinery. Beliefs, construed as functionally discrete states bearing causal power, need not be threatened by the distributed nature of representation. Rather, the notion of stable, interpretable activation patterns nested within specialized subnetworks addresses the plausibility of bridging everyday belief-talk and the seemingly diffuse computations of neural networks. Far from undermining the role of beliefs, this approach suggests that distributed representations can be harnessed to ground beliefs in precisely the manner presupposed by much of our folk-psychological and scientific discourse on mental states."],"metadata":{"id":"Sop7lXlZssOQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yMBmhefyeMob"},"source":["<a name=\"Inference\"></a>\n","## Generating through Fine-Tuned Models"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Synthesize instructions"],"metadata":{"id":"8Z2bG2vKLWMm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["instruction_synthesis_instruction = \"You are a prompt synthesizer.

This undermines arguments from natural kinds and equipotency by showing that networks can be grouped into psychological kinds based on their clustering profiles, despite differences at the units-and-weights level.\\n\\n**Reason (2):** Beliefs can be understood as long-standing dispositions to produce specific activation patterns in response to inputs, rather than transient states. This allows for causal discretion, where the activation state, not the disposition, is causally potent.\\n\\n**Reason (3):** Recurrent networks can address the issue of lemma-belief cases by allowing belief states to mediate between other beliefs and actions, using a single locus of activation in a serial process. This supports the idea that beliefs can be discretely active in a distributed model.'}\n","{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# Eliminativism Revisited\\n\\nRecall the argument concerning superpositional storage. The question was: how can it make sense to highlight a particular belief as causing an output when many weights are active in causing that output, and each weight participates in the storage of multiple data items?\\n\\nLet\\'s shift our focus from the active weights to what they are designed to do. They are intended to generate a pattern of hidden unit activity, which then causes the output.\\n\\nConsider the type of output we expect from a real-belief encoding system. Such a system must drive a complex and nuanced set of behaviors. It will resemble NETtalk (which has a large bank of output units) more than Networks A and B (which have only one unit with two degrees of freedom). Such a system is likely to undergo some form of post hoc analysis.\\n\\nSuppose it does. Let\\'s assume it undergoes a cluster analysis with labels involving semantic entities. In this case, we can untangle the superpositional storage by referring to higher-level descriptions of the hidden unit activation states. For instance, if the network, upon receiving a certain input, enters a hidden unit activation state that falls into a cluster labeled \\'dogs have fur,\\' we would be justified in saying it produced a certain output because it believed that dogs have fur at that moment.\\n\\nThese are significant assumptions: if the network succumbs to such an analysis and if it warrants labels like \\'dogs have fur.\\' However, the argument is dialectically sound. RS&G claim to argue directly from distributed, sub-symbolic storage and representation to eliminativism. The mere possibility of a cluster analysis as suggested shows that there is no direct inference of the kind claimed. If we can unpick the superpositional storage as suggested, then the arguments from natural kinds and equipotency are immediately undermined.\\n\\nConsider the argument from natural kinds again. The pivotal fact was the lack of any units-and-weights kind uniting nets A, B, and so on. But we can now see that RS&G are being unduly reductionist about well-motivated kinds. The fact that networks, which are quite varied at the units-and-connectivity level of description, are treated as instances of a psychological kind should not be surprising. This is similar to how an Amstrad and an Atari, when running the right software, can be treated as instances of a computational kind (e.g., as instantiations of a certain word-processing package). The variety-of-networks point only establishes that Connectionist psychology may need to use higher-level descriptions than units, connections, and weights. The example of cluster analysis shows that it is possible to reveal that a whole set of networks falls into an equivalence class defined by how their various weight assignments divide the spacing of possible input patterns into significant sub-spaces. Thus, it would be legitimate (given the common clustering profile) to assign all instances of NETtalk to a psychological kind, even though they look very different at the units-and-weights level. Such a grouping might help explain shared error patterns and the relative difficulty of processing various inputs. Of course, as Churchland (1989) points out, for some explanatory purposes (e.g., predicting how future learning will affect weight distributions), the differences will matter. My point is that there may be legitimate psychological-explanatory interests that call for the higher-level grouping provided by cluster analysis.\\n\\nThe basic philosophical point here is familiar. Good explanations may require grouping systems that, at a low enough level of physical description, form a \\'chaotically disjunctive set.\\' For example, economics may group an earth community and an antimatter-earth community together as instantiating Keynesian economic systems. We are probably all familiar with Putnam\\'s peg-and-hole example (see Putnam, 1981), where the explanation of variously constituted square pegs passing through square holes is given in terms of common higher-level properties like rigidity and solidity.\\n\\nFinally, consider the matter of equipotency. The concern was that it seemed nonsensical to suppose that an agent could have two beliefs, each capable of causing a given action, yet only one actually caused the action. Now consider Lesley\\'s two beliefs (one about Coopers, one about the open fire). It is straightforward to establish that the system must generally be capable of action appropriate to each belief individually (e.g., it must be capable of some range of actions that are beer-related and not fire-related). Otherwise, describing the network as knowing the two facts would be unwarranted. This requires that the system be capable of a set of hidden unit activation patterns associated with the beer-belief and a different (perhaps partially overlapping) set capable of powering different outputs, associated with the fire-belief. So we can say that one belief rather than the other was active if, for example, we found an instance of activation in the beer-cluster and not in the fire-cluster (this kind of response, in RS&G, is credited to Adrian Cussins and Gary Cottrell).\\n\\nRS&G respond by saying it is a mistake to identify the belief state with the transient activation state. They write:\\n\\n\"In common-sense psychology, beliefs and propositional memories are typically of substantial duration. An activation pattern, however, is not an enduring state of a network. For example, there is an enormous number of beliefs that you\\'ve had for years. But it makes no sense to suppose that a network could have many activation patterns continuously over a long period. At any given time, a network exhibits at most one pattern of activation.\" (Chapter 8, p. 331)\\n\\nSuppose we accept this. The next obvious move is to suggest that we might identify the belief not with the transient activation pattern but with the long-standing disposition to produce that activation pattern in a given circumstance. This move in the dialectic is credited to Ned Block and Frank Jackson. The trouble is that it is not obvious that the various dispositions said to correspond to various beliefs are sufficiently extricable from one another, as subvening states of the system, to count as the \\'discrete, independently causally active states that folk psychology requires\\' (Chapter 8, p. 333).\\n\\nBut this muddies the waters unnecessarily. Beliefs need to be long-standing states, yes. And a belief-in-action needs to be capable of having a functionally discrete realization, yes. But the folk are not committed to the view that the belief-in-action and the long-standing stored state must be physically identical. The long-standing stored state may be the disposition, given inputs A-F, to propagate activation to yield a pattern of hidden unit activation P, which falls within a cluster appropriate to \\'believing that the pub has Coopers.\\' The discrete causal potency of that belief may be the power of that class of hidden unit activation states to cause a distinctive kind of output. So we have long-standing states and a degree of causal discretion. But what has causal discretion is not the long-standing state but the state of activation to which it gives rise.\\n\\nSomeone might worry that being in a certain cluster cannot, properly speaking, be a cause. They might insist that what actually does the causing must always be a particular hidden unit activation pattern and hence that, if we have to appeal to clusterings of such patterns to find analogues for semantic items, the semantic items cannot figure in the real causal story.\\n\\nBut this is a dangerous move. It places philosophical feet on a slippery slope to physics worship (and fundamental physics worship at that). This is radically revisionary. Chemistry, for example, is generally regarded as a respectable special science, yet it groups different physical structures as instances of chemical types and defines causal laws that apply to those types. Unless the skeptic is willing to give up the causal efficacy of chemical properties too, they would be unwise to object to the very idea of higher-level constructs figuring in genuine causal claims.\\n\\nIn general, then, it seems that invoking higher-level descriptions of hidden unit activity patterns may provide the kind of causal discretion RS&G require. However, there is a class of cases (invoked in a dialectic towards the end of Chapter 8) that may still seem problematic. These are cases (call them lemma-belief cases) where a particular belief is said to cause another belief, which in turn causes an action.\\n\\nThe trouble here is simple. Our account provides a single locus of discrete, causally-active belief states, namely, the locus consisting of a hidden unit activation pattern. But in some cases, we seem to want two (or more) such loci. Consider the case of Clouseau, who has the long-standing beliefs (dispositionally analyzed) \\\\(p \\\\rightarrow q, q \\\\rightarrow s, p \\\\rightarrow r, r \\\\rightarrow s\\\\) and learns that \\\\(p\\\\). Suppose we want to say of Clouseau that:\\n(a) he infers \\\\(s\\\\) using only the \\\\(q\\\\)-information; and\\n(b) his belief that \\\\(s\\\\) then causes him to perform an action \\\\(A\\\\).\\n\\nIt now looks as if the hidden unit states resulting from input \\\\(p\\\\) need to fall simultaneously into the \\\\(q\\\\)-cluster and the \\\\(s\\\\)-cluster variety. But the network cannot be in both states at once.\\n\\nThe answer here is to introduce a notion of recurrency. A recurrent network is one that can cycle an output state back as an input state and continue processing. Any good model of the belief system must allow that belief can play two roles. One is to mediate between perception and action. The other is to mediate between belief and belief. This means that the output states and input states must be capable of taking belief states as data too. In which case, the answer to the single locus worry is to invoke a single locus used twice in a serial process. Thus, in the Clouseau case, we would have input \\\\(p\\\\) yielding hidden unit activation falling into the \\\\(q\\\\)-cluster sector, which causes output meaning that \\\\(q\\\\). This is then cycled back as input, yielding activation falling into the \\\\(s\\\\)-sector and causing action \\\\(A\\\\).\\n\\nIn sum, it seems that, contrary to the eliminativists\\' conditional argument, distributed sub-symbolic models can allow for individual beliefs to be discretely active in causing behavior and other beliefs. They can do so if we adopt the following analysis:\\n1. Long-standing states of believing that \\\\(p\\\\) = the network\\'s disposition, given apt input, to produce hidden unit activation states falling into a cluster that warrants the label \\\\(p\\\\).\\n2.

The question was: how can it make sense to highlight a particular belief as causing an output when many weights are active in causing that output, and each weight participates in the storage of multiple data items?\\n\\nLet\\'s shift our focus from the active weights to what they are designed to do. They are intended to generate a pattern of hidden unit activity, which then causes the output.\\n\\nConsider the type of output we expect from a real-belief encoding system. Such a system must drive a complex and nuanced set of behaviors. It will resemble NETtalk (which has a large bank of output units) more than Networks A and B (which have only one unit with two degrees of freedom). Such a system is likely to undergo some form of post hoc analysis.\\n\\nSuppose it does. Let\\'s assume it undergoes a cluster analysis with labels involving semantic entities. In this case, we can untangle the superpositional storage by referring to higher-level descriptions of the hidden unit activation states. For instance, if the network, upon receiving a certain input, enters a hidden unit activation state that falls into a cluster labeled \\'dogs have fur,\\' we would be justified in saying it produced a certain output because it believed that dogs have fur at that moment.\\n\\nThese are significant assumptions: if the network succumbs to such an analysis and if it warrants labels like \\'dogs have fur.\\' However, the argument is dialectically sound. RS&G claim to argue directly from distributed, sub-symbolic storage and representation to eliminativism. The mere possibility of a cluster analysis as suggested shows that there is no direct inference of the kind claimed. If we can unpick the superpositional storage as suggested, then the arguments from natural kinds and equipotency are immediately undermined.\\n\\nConsider the argument from natural kinds again. The pivotal fact was the lack of any units-and-weights kind uniting nets A, B, and so on. But we can now see that RS&G are being unduly reductionist about well-motivated kinds. The fact that networks, which are quite varied at the units-and-connectivity level of description, are treated as instances of a psychological kind should not be surprising. This is similar to how an Amstrad and an Atari, when running the right software, can be treated as instances of a computational kind (e.g., as instantiations of a certain word-processing package). The variety-of-networks point only establishes that Connectionist psychology may need to use higher-level descriptions than units, connections, and weights. The example of cluster analysis shows that it is possible to reveal that a whole set of networks falls into an equivalence class defined by how their various weight assignments divide the spacing of possible input patterns into significant sub-spaces. Thus, it would be legitimate (given the common clustering profile) to assign all instances of NETtalk to a psychological kind, even though they look very different at the units-and-weights level.

This claim remains valid as long as the networks in question do not demonstrate causal systematicity in their processes, particularly when considering input-output generalizations at the level of semantic description, as defined by classical task analysis. Indeed, these networks do not exhibit such systematicity.\\n\\nConsider a hypothetical network where input states represent various facts about coffee in different contexts. For instance, some input states might indicate coffee in a cup, coffee in a jug, coffee in a glass, coffee with sugar, and similarly for wine. Correspondingly, output states might represent a warm drink in a cup, jug, glass, or with sugar.\\n\\nSuppose this network performs basic inferential transitions. An input state signifying \"coffee in a cup\" results in an output state signifying \"warm drink in a cup\"; similarly, \"coffee with sugar\" leads to \"warm drink with sugar,\" and so forth. Observing this externally, a pattern emerges: whenever the input state signifies coffee, the output state signifies a warm drink.\\n\\nTo determine if the network\\'s process is causally systematic relative to this pattern, we must ask whether all coffee-to-warm-drink transitions share a common explanation. Specifically, is there a mechanism within the network responsible solely for these transitions?\\n\\nGenerally, the answer is no. There is not a single set of connection weights responsible for all and only the coffee-to-warm-drink transitions. In terms of rule knowledge, it is inaccurate to describe the network as possessing the rule: \"Given: there is coffee; Infer: there is a warm drink,\" even though the network\\'s behavior aligns with this rule.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the context of sentence interpretation, a network with distributed, microfeatural input and output encoding might conform to the rule: \"Given: the sentence contains the predicate \\'is drunk\\'; Infer: the proposition concerns the property of being drunk.\" However, if the input representation of \"is drunk\" varies, the explanation for the network\\'s conformity to this rule will differ from case to case.\\n\\nThis does not imply that connectionist networks involve entirely distinct and independent processes for each transition that follows a pattern. Connectionist networks offer a middle ground between strict commonality and complete autonomy or modularity. They exist between systems with rule knowledge and mere lookup tables.\\n\\nConnectionism does not challenge the conditional claim that causal systematicity of process implies syntactic structure in input states. With distributed representation, there is typically neither syntax nor systematicity. Moreover, there may be no systematicity in the input-output process, even when syntactic structure exists in the input states.\\n\\nThis typical lack of causal systematicity does not inherently oppose the connectionist approach. If a cognitive process is causally systematic, distributed connectionism may not be an ideal model. However, determining whether a cognitive process is systematic in the relevant sense is an empirical question.\\n\\nTherefore, whether modeling actual cognitive processes poses a challenge for connectionism requires detailed empirical investigation. Nonetheless, the second stage of our argument highlights a tension between the connectionist approach to modeling cognition and our common-sense understanding of ourselves as thinkers. At first glance, the connectionist paradigm does not offer a robust scientific psychological model for conceptualized thought and inference.'}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":436,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739813268969,"user":{"displayName":"Sam","userId":"18172871330063317003"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"BnhZrBu5qHyL","outputId":"2d0b430f-48ae-4eaf-bab3-b035d4646d2f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["No

Functionally Discrete Beliefs and Causal Role}\n","\n","The second aspect of propositional modularity is the concept of functionally discrete beliefs. In everyday psychology, beliefs are treated as distinct entities that can be individually referenced and play a causal role in behavior. For instance, if someone believes that the train leaves at 10:00, this belief might cause them to arrive at the station by 9:45. If they also believe the train leaves at 10:30, they might arrive at 10:15. The belief about the 10:00 departure is seen as a distinct, causally significant entity.\n","\n","In connectionist models, the question arises: can a network's state be considered a functionally discrete belief? The answer is not straightforward. While a network's state can be seen as a belief, it is not functionally discrete in the same way as beliefs in everyday psychology. A network's state is a complex pattern of activation across many units, and it is not clear how to isolate a single belief from this pattern.\n","\n","However, it is possible to imagine a connectionist system where certain activation patterns recur in specific contexts, acting as distinct, causally significant states. For example, a network might have a pattern that represents the belief that the train leaves at 10:00, which recurs whenever this belief is relevant. This pattern could direct the network's processing toward outcomes associated with the belief, such as arriving at the station by 9:45.\n","\n","In this scenario, the network's state can be seen as a functionally discrete belief. The pattern representing the belief about the 10:00 departure is distinct from other patterns and has a unique causal influence on the network's behavior.\n","\n","However, there are challenges to this view. Connectionist systems are often highly distributed, with no clear boundaries between different patterns.
